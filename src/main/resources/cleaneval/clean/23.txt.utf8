                          <h>Successful Deaf Leaders

   <h>Overview
   <p>Students have the opportunity to learn about, meet, and pay
   tribute to local Deaf Leaders who exemplify the belief that deaf
   people can do anything except hear. Selecting leaders, they conduct
   videotaped interviews, transcribe tapes from American Sign Language to
   English, and use this information to write biographical sketches of
   each leader. Creating a computer slide show that includes their own
   photography, they add the information to a link on the school's web
   site. The entire school community honors the successful Deaf Leaders
   at a formal presentation where framed photos/biographical sketches are
   installed on the school's Wall of Fame.
