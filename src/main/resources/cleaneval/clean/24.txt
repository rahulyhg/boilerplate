   <h>Explaining loss of positions to a future employer

   <h>By Andrea Wolf, Globe Correspondent, 6/20/04

   <p> Q. At the end of 2000, I was laid off from a job that I loved.
   The position was rewarding and the company was a great place to work.
   I was devastated and jumped at the first job opportunity that came my
   way. I wasn't thrilled with the job but I worked hard and was rewarded
   with salary increases, bonuses, and company perks during my three
   years of employment. Last month, I found myself standing in the
   unemployment line again. Although both layoffs were due to poor
   business climates and not performance, I feel embarrassed and
   discouraged. I have stellar references from both employers, including
   the managers who made the layoff decisions, but I am concerned about
   what future employers may think. I also wonder if I may be in the
   wrong profession since I have been dispensable to two employers. Do
   you have any suggestions as to how I can handle the interview process
   to put a more positive spin on the situation?

   <p> A. You are faced with a common situation in today's job market.
   Many companies are downsizing and cutting strong performers like
   yourself. It is evident that you were highly valued by both companies.

   <p>What is important for you to internalize is that your position was
   eliminated for business, not personal reasons. Remember to reflect on
   the key strengths and benefits you brought the company.

   <p>You raise the uncomfortable feelings of how to explain your job loss
   to a future employer. Prepare a ''reason for leaving'' statement. You
   want to develop a statement that is truthful and acceptable to your
   previous and prospective employer. Keep it short, factual, and
   positive. I recommend a three-part story:

   <p>Background: A brief and positive description of your role and
   responsibilities.

   <p>Facts: The company faced an economic downturn and your position was
   eliminated.

   <p>Moving forward: Therefore, you are looking to utilize your skills in a
   new position.

   <p>As a result of the layoff, you seem to be questioning if you are
   working in the wrong profession. It sounds like you jumped too quickly
   into your second job without evaluating the fit.

   <p>Consider this as a good time to do some self-assessment. You can start
   by looking at the skills you most enjoyed in your positions and ask
   for feedback from colleagues. Then you could explore other interest
   areas through networking. Since you are at a turning point, you may
   want to consider career coaching so that you can make a good decision
   in your next position.

   <h>IT workers may need to reevaluate careers

   <p> Q. I'm one of the many IT workers who have been out of work in my
   field for a very long time. I had not planned a career change as I
   enjoyed what I was doing. However, I'm really starting to wonder if
   it's time to think about doing something else. I just don't feel from
   what I read about outsourcing that the IT sector will recover. What
   are your thoughts?

   <p> A. Offshore outsourcing is a growing phenomenon affecting
   technology professionals who remain underemployed or out of work, like
   yourself.

   <p>Although some areas in IT are expected to rebound as the economy
   strengthens, outsourcing to India and Southeast Asia has caused great
   competition for existing industry positions.

   <p>According to market research firm, Gartner Inc., business process
   offshoring is expected to reach $1.8 billion in 2003 on a global
   basis, representing a 38 percent increase from the previous year.

   <p>Two years is a long time to be out of work. Such a hiatus from the
   workplace is worthy of a serious reevaluation of your IT career. The
   field has been hit hard but there are some opportunities that are
   beginning to open up depending on expertise.

   <p>As a starting point, determine what skills you have that tap into the
   current market needs for IT specialists. If your skill set is valued,
   then you need to evaluate your job search strategy.

   <p>Ask yourself: How and where did you deliver value in your previous
   job? What did you contribute that made your business group successful?
   How current is your skill base?

   <p>It's also worth exploring whether you have the required qualifications
   and skills the market demands. You may want to pursue further
   education or training to broaden your experience.

   <p>What other skills and knowledge do you have? For example, do you have
   experience with administrative IT programs in project management,
   payroll, or accounting systems? These skills may help you present
   yourself to other industries. If you have an understanding of an
   industry sector and its technology needs, then that may be an
   advantage to you.

   <p>I have seen many IT professionals who have thoroughly scoured the job
   market with no success and have decided to work as contract
   consultants or take project-based work assignments on a temporary
   basis. This allows employers some staffing and cost flexibility.
   Sometimes these assignments can lead to full-time positions.

   <p>With all the changes in the market, everyone needs to be current in
   their field. In addition, we need to understand outsourcing's impact
   on business. The nature of work is changing so dramatically that most
   economists haven't even figured out the implications yet. Although we
   see the trend of outsourcing IT jobs to some countries and a decrease
   in these jobs in the United States, it is unclear what the future
   holds.

   <p>With any change comes both risk and opportunity. IT professionals may
   need to focus on the career paths that globalization is creating.

   <p>If many programming positions have disappeared, consider developing
   skills in understanding and translating business processes and
   utilizing project management experience. Doing so might enable IT
   professionals to position themselves as the liaison for offshore
   development projects.

   <p>To be competitive, IT professionals can no longer rely on their
   technical expertise solely but need to have expertise in industry
   specific business practices. They will need to be able to translate
   business needs to IT practices.

   <p>Some points to consider as you examine your career options:
     <l>* Look at your additional skills and become more of a generalist as
       you will be better positioned if you are skilled in both
       technology and the business side of IT.

     <l>* Look to smaller organizations. Fortune 500 companies will focus
       most on offshoring.

     <l>* Start your own consulting business if you have the entrepreneurial
       spirit.

     <l>* Look into areas of growth such as healthcare and education.

     <l>* Get further education to update skills and retrain.

     <l>* Explore changing career fields through the help of one-stop career
       centers or career counseling.


   <h>Staying, complaining won't help your career

   <p> Q. I will be leaving my current position in about a year. My
   annual review is in a few weeks. I recently discovered that someone
   hired five months ago started at a salary $1,500 a year higher than
   mine, even though we both have an identical job title and description.
   I was told by my headhunter when the job was offered to me that there
   would be no negotiation of salary, so I accepted the offer as it
   stood. There are multiple problems at work including rampant turnover,
   low employee morale, and favoritism on the part of the office manager.
   Do I ignore the salary imbalance and just say ''good riddance'' to the
   job when it comes time to move on? Do I confront the office manager
   during my annual review and ask about the disparity in salaries? Do I
   contact the firm's human resources manager and discuss the disparity
   with him? Do I contact him now or wait to see what is offered at my
   review?

   <p> A. You may want to reevaluate your plan of staying in your
   present job for one more year. Why are you waiting to leave if you
   detest your boss and see both an unequal salary as well as limited
   future growth potential? If you are holding on for one more year in
   hopes of a higher salary, don't hold your breath.

   <p>You do not describe any positive actions you have taken. I wonder what
   efforts you have made to work more effectively with your boss.
   Remember, you were hired to provide skills that help your company and
   it is your job to meet your boss' needs.

   <p>If the differences are too great, then you have a choice: leave the
   company. To stay, complain, and hang in there demonstrates an attitude
   that will not help you progress in your career.

   <p>Regarding the salary issue, you can always ask for what you think is
   fair in the negotiation with your hiring manager before accepting the
   offer. At this point, however, I think that raising the salary issue
   is a waste of your time and may create ill will.

   <p>In the future, be wary of a headhunter who says there is no
   negotiation. They are working for the company to fill the job and not
   necessarily for your best interests. Understand that negotiation is a
   natural part of developing a win-win situation with a future employer.

   <p>I advise you to view your situation as a learning experience so that
   moving forward you can proceed at your professional best.

   <h>Be upfront about need for flexible schedule

   <p> Q. I am looking for a 24- or 30-hour-a-week position, and I am
   considering applying for positions that are advertised as full time.
   My hope is being able to negotiate shorter hours, or do job sharing.
   My field is health services research. Positions are often grant-funded
   in this field, and I have been told that there is often room for
   flexibility in setting work hours. At what point in the application
   process should I disclose that I am seeking part-time work?

   <p> A. The field of health services research may allow for
   flexibility in scheduling, but my advice is go for the position as
   advertised so that you do not eliminate yourself up front. In the
   interview, you can ask about the job expectations to get a fuller
   picture of the position without hinting that you want part time.

   <p>Your goal is to interview well, get the job offer, and then have a
   follow-up meeting where you can negotiate for flex time or reduced
   hours. Be prepared to share how you will get all the work done within
   that time frame and how you can be most productive.

   <p>You are at a much greater advantage to ask for changes after you have
   received the offer. Since the company offered you the position, they
   value you above the other applicants and may be willing to accommodate
   you.
