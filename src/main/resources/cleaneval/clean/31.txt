<h>Summary

<h>Living Places
<p>Case studies of the urban renaissance in the South East have been
   published by the DTLR. The report examines 30 case studies from the
   South East region.

<p>Living Places (case studies of the urban renaissance in the South
   East) was jointly commissioned in 2000 by the Government Office for
   the South East (GOSE) and the then Department of the Environment,
   Transport and the Regions (DETR).
<p>The aims of the research were to:
    <l>Explain why urban renaissance is important for the SouthEast, and
       where it is likely to be most relevant
    <l>Describe what urban renaissance entails
    <l>Show how different places in the South East are already
       implementing various aspects of urban renaissance
    <l>Draw conclusions on good practice

<p>The Living Places report is based on a comprehensive review of recent
   research and policy guidance on issues relating to urban renaissance
   and on 30 case studies of what is already being done in this field.
<p>The great majority of the case studies are drawn from the South East
   Region itself, although a few come from other parts of the old ROSE
   area (and exclude Greater London which as a world city is on a very
   different scale from anywhere else in the South East).
<p>The case studies have been drawn from a range of different types and
   sizes of towns, and from different parts of the region, so that more
   people will be able to find situations that they can identify with.
   One case study and one example however (both focusing on public
   transport) are drawn from mainland Europe. The Research Review and the
   case studies are contained in a separate Technical Report published on
   DLTR website.
