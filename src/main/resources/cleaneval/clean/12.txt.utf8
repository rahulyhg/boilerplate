   <p>Clement, Lynne, "Revising & Editing," 1991, rev. 2000.
   A brief sheet that discusses the differences between revising and
   editing and gives teachers tips on dealing with groups of students
   when conducting these activities. It stresses the importance of
   revising student work for content and meaning, before giving any
   attention to the mechanics. Quick to read, but worthwhile.
   <p>Hansen, Jane, When Writers Read, Chapter 12; Heineman, 1985.
   This article gives teachers some information on the connections
   between reading and writing and how to capitalize on them for success
   in writing instruction. It focuses on skills instruction, reasons for
   it, how to implement it, and what to keep in mind as classes are
   conducted.

   <p>Jenkinson, Edward B., "Learning to Write/Writing to Learn," Phi Delta
   Kappan, 1988.
   This article will give teachers some background on the difference
   between the two activities mentioned in the title and the importance
   of both for their students. "For thousands of students, writing is
   like trying to run through a minefield strewn with run-on sentences,
   misspellings, dangling modifiers, and trite expressions. A successful
   crossing is a rare experience, according to Mr. Jenkinson, who argues
   that writing should serve instead as a powerful catalyst for
   learning."

   <h>The National Writing Project
   <p>http://www-gse.berkeley.edu/Research/NWP/nwp.html 
   The homepage of the mother of all writing projects. It is the oldest
   and most widely respected project to train teachers to teach writing
   across the curriculum. It leads to all kinds of local writing projects
   and training opportunities.

   <h>Purdue University's Online Writing Lab
   <p>http://owl.english.purdue.edu/
   This site includes basics for teachers and students. There is a
   resource section that includes 130 instructional handouts! Teachers
   should definitely have a look at the "Resources for Teachers"
   section's "Materials for teaching writing in any discipline." It
   includes a great guide for developing assignments.
