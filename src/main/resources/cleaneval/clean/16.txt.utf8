<h>Blood pressure monitors - 5-minute CHOICE

  <h>What to look for

   <p>About one in seven Australian adults suffer from some form of high
   blood pressure, or hypertension (as it's known medically). If you're
   one of them, monitoring your condition regularly at home with a blood
   pressure monitor (and in co-operation with your GP) can be useful.
     <l> Buy from a pharmacy or medical equipment supplier, where you can
       get proper advice and a demonstration of how to use the monitor.
     <l> Arm monitors are generally more accurate than wrist models; in our
       test, only one wrist model could match them.
     <l> If you buy an arm monitor, measure your arm size to get the
       right-size cuff.
     <l> Make sure the monitor's keys and display are easy to read.
     <l> Models that inflate the cuff automatically tend to work better
       than those requiring you to do it manually (by pumping a bulb),
       though there are exceptions.
     <l> The cuff has to be inflated to a level above the systolic blood
       pressure. However, the automatic setting on the monitor may be a
       lot higher, and you may find it uncomfortable. Models with
       adjustable inflation level allow you to program the pressure to
       one that's comfortable for you. Models with fuzzy logic detect the
       ideal inflation level automatically.
     <l> If a monitor has a memory to store a number of your recent blood
       pressure measurements, it can be helpful as a back-up. However,
       it's a good idea to record all measurements separately, so that
       you and your GP get a sufficient history.
     <l> Manufacturers give different advice regarding the use of
       rechargeable batteries; check in the shop before you buy.
     <l> While you should use a blood pressure monitor in co-operation with
       your GP, it's still very helpful if the monitor comes with good
       general background information on blood pressure issues, for your
       reference.

<h>What's blood pressure?

   <p>Blood pressure is created by the heart pumping blood through the
   arteries. It's measured as two numbers, in millimetres of mercury
   (mmHg) based on the standard method using a mercury sphygmomanometer
   (the machine your doctor uses in their surgery) and a stethoscope;
   giving a result such as '120 over 80' (120/80 mmHg).

   <p>The higher figure is the systolic pressure, caused by the contracting
   (beating) heart. The lower figure is called diastolic, and is the
   pressure between beats, when the heart relaxes.

   <p>Hypertension can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, heart
   failure and kidney disease, but doesn't necessarily do so. When
   weighing up your risk, your GP will also consider factors such as your
   age, sex, family history and weight, and whether you smoke.

   <h>WHO definitions
   <h>Blood pressure (mmHg)             Diagnosis
   <p>Up to 120/80                        Optimal
   Up to 130/85                         Normal
   Up to 140/90                    High normal
   Up to 160/100             Mild hypertension
   Up to 180/110         Moderate hypertension
   Above 180/110           Severe hypertension

<h>What you can do

   <p>Your lifestyle can have an impact on your blood pressure. To prevent
   hypertension or to manage it once you've been diagnosed:
     <l> Have regular check-ups, especially when you know you have high
       blood pressure.
     <l> Don't smoke.
     <l> Limit the amount of alcohol you drink.
     <l> Exercise regularly (but note that there are certain sports to
       avoid when you have high blood pressure, such as lifting heavy
       weights). Consider stress-reducing techniques such as yoga and
       meditation.
     <l> Avoid salty and fatty foods, and reduce your consumption of red
       meat.
     <l> Eat plenty of cereals, fish, fruit and vegetables.
     <l> Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.
     <l> If lifestyle changes don't lower your blood pressure enough, your
       doctor may prescribe medication. Make sure you take it, and don't
       adjust the dosage yourself based on your own blood pressure
       measurements. This is known as 'self-diagnosis', and fiddling with
       your medication yourself can have serious consequences.
