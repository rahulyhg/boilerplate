<h>On a wing and a prayer

   <p>Using amateur actors and a traumatised chicken, City of God exposes
   the violent truth of life in the slums of Brazil. Here, the
   Oscar-winning director Walter Salles explains why it had to be made
   <h>Saturday December 21, 2002

   <p>It begins with a chicken who knows too much. We are in City of God, a
   favela (a Rio de Janeiro slum) in the early 1980s. A gang of young
   drug-dealers is preparing feijoada, the local stew. This chicken knows
   that she is dead meat and tries desperately to escape. The tragi-comic
   scene that ensues determines the tone of City of God, a Brazilian film
   by Fernando Meirelles, co-directed by Katia Lund. The fleeing animal
   is chased and fired at by the young hoodlums until fate leads her
   under the wheels of a police car.


   <p>A clash between the young princes of the favela and the police is
   imminent and promises to be bloody. It will, however, be frozen in
   time, as Meirelles takes us to the 1960s and 1970s in the same locale.
   Based on a true account by Paulo Lins, a writer born and raised in the
   place that lends its name to the film, City of God does not offer the
   comforting and touristy image of the Brazilian slums that Marcel
   Camus's 1959 film Orfeu Negro sold to the world. This is about a
   nation within a nation, about the millions of olvidados (the
   forgotten) that are statistically relevant, but scarcely represented
   on screen.

   <p>Rarely has a film created such heated debate in Brazil. The country's
   current leader, Luiz Inacio da Silva, at the time the socialist
   presidential candidate, urged the then president, Fernando Henrique
   Cardoso, to see City of God in order to understand the extent of the
   urban tragedy in Brazil. Cardoso did. Arnaldo Jabor, one of Brazil's
   most important intellectuals, wrote that "this is not only a film. It
   is an important fact, a crucial statement, a hole in our national
   conscience."

   <p>After I directed the Oscar-winning Central Station, our small
   production house had the opportunity to help a few films by upcoming
   Brazilian directors. The decision to be part of City of God was
   defined by the trust we had in Meirelles and his co-director, but also
   because few films could shed more light on the social apartheid of
   Brazil.

   <p>There are more than 40,000 violent deaths a year in Brazil, more than
   three times the total number of deaths in Kosovo. Many of these deaths
   in our urban areas are the result of confrontation between drug gangs,
   or between dealers and the police. What City of God achieves is the
   possibility to understand how we got to this chaos.

   <p>In the 1960s, families of immigrants expelled from their land in the
   north-east of the country found an illusory refuge in the slums of the
   capital, Rio de Janeiro. The marginalised youth living on the fringe
   of society at that time had to bend to strict familial codes and
   rules. The drug was marijuana, which inspired a contemplative,
   "romantic" lifestyle. Gun use at the time was sporadic and the ends
   justified the means.

   <p>In the 1970s and 1980s everything changed. The first large
   drug-dealers appeared and outlaws ceased to lead a nomadic life and
   settled their businesses in the heart of the favelas. These dealers
   began to control the communities in which they operated and created a
   parallel system of justice within their borders. Cocaine became the
   drug of choice and the .38 was traded for the AK47 and other machine
   guns. The death toll grew dramatically and the dealers became younger
   and younger. It was hell.

   <p>City of God follows several real characters, whose lives started and
   ended within the favela's perimeter during these three decades. Bene,
   the cool marijuana dealer, Ze PequeÃ±o, a merciless killer, and Rocket,
   the innocent eye, Lins's alter ego, a young black kid who manages to
   break the country's social and race barriers - at a price.

   <p>Most of the film's actors are kids from amateur theatre groups in
   favelas, or non-actors found in a year-long casting effort in these
   communities. The directors rehearsed them for more than six months
   before the shoot and improvisation was encouraged. Like other
   directors in Brazil, I am used to working with non-actors, but I still
   do not know how Meirelles and Lund managed to achieve such a sense of
   realism.

   <p>Do not expect pity or redemption. There are no such things in City of
   God. This is the depiction of a world where people have been forgotten
   for too long by the Brazilian ruling classes; a world where the state
   does not provide proper health or education services. In fact, the
   only items it provides freely are bullets.

   <p>Now for the present: a time when the olvidados got tired of being
   forgotten, a time of diffuse, uncontrollable violence. " City of God
   is not only a portrait of our favelas, it is also our portrait, at 24
   frames a second, our faces blurred with the faces of 10-year-old
   children holding machine guns. All the manifestations of our chaos
   become visible. This film will be seen by the whole country in terror,
   and I believe it will cause transformations in the political arena,"
   says Jabor.

   <p>There were also dissonant voices in Brazil, arguing that the film
   gives the impression that favelas are populated only by drug-dealers.
   They are not. In fact, an immense part of the Brazilian population has
   been the victim of this present state. This is when we realise that
   the chicken caught in the cross-fire at the beginning of City of God
   is not only a chicken. It is the reflection of so many Brazilians
   trapped in an unjust country.

   <p>· City of God is released on January 3.

   <p>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and
   Clarifications column, Tuesday January 14 2003

   <p>An editing error introduced the claim that the director's earlier
   film, Central Station, was an Oscar winner. It was nominated for best
   foreign film in 1999, but it did not win the Academy Award.
