<h>1975 - 2004
<p>We lost Michelle to cancer after a courageous five year battle with

<p>Dear Richardson Family, I am so sorry to hear that your Michelle
       passed away. It sadden's me. I never met her, but heard all
       wonderful and good things by her grandmother. She was a beautiful
       woman. I know she is in heaven dancing with god and his angels and
       will be young and beautiful forever. May god be with you now and
       always. Michelle is in my prayers. God Bless you all.

<p>I loved her from the day she was born, my beautiful
       grand-daughter, Michelle, now an angel in God's kingdom where love
       reigns supreme, where pain is no more. Cancer devastated her body,
       but never her spirit and her love of life she fought for so
       valiantly, and so long. The memory of her will live on to help
       ease the pain that we, who loved her deeply, feel at her passing.
       My sweet Michelle, I miss you so!

<p>Michelle was an inspiration to me. She never gave up hope in her
       battle, she always had her sense of humor and made the best of the
       situation.. I came in contact with Michelle last year when I was
       going through a colonoscopy to rule out colon cancer. I was very
       scared, being only 23 and having gone through this at a young age,
       she was able to relate to the anxiety and fear I was experiencing.
       She gave me hope and courage no matter what the outcome would be.
       Thankfully, I was clear, but later that year I lost my grandmother
       and my grandfather both to cancer. They were both only in their
       60's and they raised me, so this was like losing my parents. Her
       words gave me strength, and her story inspired me to make the most
       of every day and to live my life to the fullest. I will truly miss
       Michelle and my thoughts and prayers go out to her grieving family
       as I understand what they are going through. May they find some
       peace in knowing Michelle is no longer suffering.

<p>To the Friends and Family of Michelle, we are saddened to hear of

<p>To Michele's family i would like to say how sorry I am to hear of
       her death. I had corresponded with Michele through the ratlist
       group and it was a pleasure talking to her. Please accept my
       sincere condolences.

<p>Michelle and family - we're sorry to hear this news. Michelle was
       an inspiration to all; not only those who met her, but also those
       she talked to on the internet. May we all show the same courage,
       should we be so challenged! We will not forget her. Sending hugs
       for you all from the UK. Love,
       Light and Healing to you all,
       <h>Andy and Gwen. Andy and Gwen Murray (Thornton-Cleveleys)
<p>I am Michelle's father and would like to thank everyone for their
       thoughtful and caring comments. We have been told that Michelle
       will be deposited off the coast of Sarasota, Florida as part of a
       community reef structure that will serve many sea creatures as a
       home for generations to come.

<p>I just found out about Michelle. I'd had suspicions that she
       wasn't doing well since I had invited her to some shows and she
       hadn't replied. I figured she was doing poorly and just didn't
       want to be seen or to have to talk about it. Michelle was first
       diagnosed while she was directing my play in the Minnesota Fringe
       Festival. Even while she was in treatment she went ahead and
       directed the show. Throughout her entire illness, with every
       setback she was still fighting, taking lessons, auditioning, etc.
       I was continually amazed at her will to live and keep going. I
       feel bad that I just now found out and wasn't able to go to her
       memorial. My deepest condolences to her family and all of her
       other friends. Goodbye, Michelle.

<p>Dear Michelle's Family I did not get to meet Michelle but met her
       through the Ratlist, When I visited her web page I shed Tears of
       Joy and sadness I spoke off list to your wonderful daughter she,
       truly was and inspiration to many who are taken from us before
       their time. We shared laughter about the antics of our rats, and I
       cry knowing I will never talk across the virtual ether to her
       again, I have lit a candle for your family, and pray that I will
       also meet Michelle at the Rainbow Bridge, Them most amazing thing
       about Michelle was not only her courage but her Wonderful Sense of
       Humour. I felt I knew her and I loved her like a daughter. And I
       truley believed she was called from this world as there the need
       for a New Angel in Heaven, and Every time you have that pain in
       your hearts it is just Michele Plucking your Heart Strings and
       Skating around your Souls saying "I have not left you, My Spirit
       is here with you, and I will be with you always Till we meet again
       at the Bridge". And she will welcome all with her Cheeky Humour
       and Beautiful smile and with Love with Wrap you all in Her Angels
       Wings. May your memories of her Bring you Joy and keep you
       smiling. I was Blessed to know her for such a short but forever
       special time. Love and Peace to you all.

<p>My deepest sympathies go to Michelle's family. She and I became
       friends at Stephens, and even closer at Oxford. After graduation,
       we lost touch, though we did share the odd email. While at Oxford,
       we were in a production of 'Steel Magnolias' - I was M'Lynn to her
       Truvy...I'll always remember her that way - incredibly happy and
       enjoying being a Brit.

<p>I want to give my condolences to the Richardson family. I first
       found your daughter's sight when I was diagnosed with cancer
       exactly a year ago this month at age 27. It was nice to have
       someone my age to talk to and help me understand what treatments I
       had coming. I prayed for her to enter remission as I did. Just
       know that she helped many of us through our darkest hours and if
       your family ever needs anything I will be there for you. Love
       Stacy

<p>I knew Michelle from the Young Women's Cancer Support Group at the
       Women's Cancer Resource Center in Minneapolis. She showed such
       determination to overcome her illness that it is hard for me to
       believe she is now gone. My deepest sympathy and best wishes to
       her family.
       <h>Sarah sarah wovcha (minneapolis, MN)
<p>I knew Michelle through the adultedge group for adult figure
       skaters. Her posts showed what a strong, sweet person she was. I
       hope her family and friends know how much others admired her. I
       wish them peace.

<p>I am a friend of Michelle's from the Yahoo Skating Group. I met
       her while we were both bidding on the same skating dress on ebay
       and we clicked immediately. I have been corresponding with her for
       a few years. I just read the devistating news and I am horrified.
       I will miss her spirit and her optimism. She was an inspiration!
       My deepest sympathy to her family and those who loved her- Jani

       an inspiration and will be missed.

<p>I'm sorry to hear of Michelle's passing, I am a member of an
       online skating group she was involved with. I, and many others
       will miss her words, and may she not only dance with the angles,
       but also skate with them.
       <h>Steven Arness (Akron, OH) steve74@attglobal.net
<p>I "met" Michelle on the ratlist. She opened my eyes to quite a few
       things that I took for granted. She was a strong woman and very
       much admired and I'm very glad to have known her. My condolences
       to you, her family.

<p>I hadn't heard from Michelle in awhile & I hadn't been on here
       because my cancer came back & I have been very sick. I decided to
       come on here today to check my e-mail & look at things I hadn't
       seen in a long time. I decided to check out Michelle's site to see
       how she was. I am utterly devastasted that she is no longer with
       us. It is so unfair that such a beautiful person had such a short
       life. I found her site when I was first diagnosed & everything she
       went through at first was identical to what I was going through.
       She helped me so much when I thought I couldn't get through this.
       She would e-mail when I was down & give me encouragement. She gave
       me such hope & now I am just totally devastated. I feel so bad
       that I just found out now. I just want her family to know that I
       prayed for her daily & that you should be so proud & were so lucky
       to have had such a wonderful & beautiful angel in your life. I
       know that she is looking down on all of us that she helped & loved
       & she will continue to help us. My heart is hurting so much right
       now. Even though I only talked to her on-line, I considered her a
       dear friend. My hope was to meet her in person one day. I will
       miss her more than words can say. I don't know how I'm going to
       get through this without her. Thank you to her family for sharing
       her with us. God Bless You All! Love, Maria

<p>Thank you- I miss my daughter very much. I know she dances with
       the angels.

<p>Dear Family and Friends of Michelle, My condolences for the
       passing of Michelle. I found her link in a site; I am sure she
       surrounded by such love and peace. Bless you all during this
       difficult time, Nichole
       <h>Nichole (Austin, TX)
<p>I feel like I have known Michelle for a long time even though I
       never spoke to her. You see, everything I knew about Michelle, I
       hear from my daughter April. April was a Chemo Angel for Michelle,
       but for April..it was more like Michelle was the Chemo Angel for
       April. I know that Michelle became a very important part of
       April's life and she will be missed greatly, not only by her
       family and friends but by anyone and everyone that knew her. I
       really believe there is a special place in heaven for people like
       MIchelle. May God Bless all of her family and friends in this very
       hard time of sorrow. Try to see Michelle in every sunrise and
       sunset. In every song the birds sings, and every flower that
       blooms. Michelle will only really be gone..if we fail to remember
       her. Again..God Be With All of You ! April's Mom. Diana

<p>Even in her illness, Michelle's livelihood was more than most
       people I know who are healthy. She did more in her short time on
       earth than most people do in a lifetime. She truly loved life and
       redeemed all the time she had. Her message speaks loudly to us
       all.

<p>Michelle was a wonderful, strong, beautiful person. She touched my
       life in many ways and I am a better person having known her. She
       will be greatly missed. My love and compassion goes out to her
       family and friends.
       <h>April McGurer (Garrettsville, OH) adm61175@hotmail.com
<p>For those of us who knew Michelle, she was a constant symbol of
       strength and optimism. She will be sorely missed by all of us who
       knew and loved her.
       <h>Joel Jensen (Cottage Grove, MN)
<p>I will miss Michelle very much. I am a coworker at the Hotel in
       Minneapolis where she worked. She was very very brave. My sympathy
       to the family. I know she is in no pain now, God rest her soul.
       <h>Bonnie LaMotte (Saint Paul, MN) Scrapper214@yahoo.com
<p>My thoughts and prayers are with you at this difficult time. May
       all your good memories of Michelle help to easy the pain you are
       feeling.

<p>Dear Bobby, My aunt, Ilona has sent me the website of her
       memories. I've seen her picture the first time. I was touched
       deeply. Since I've never met you and her I can only feel the
       spiritual connection with you. God give you the strength to
       remember. Your cousin Tünde (and all my family)
       <h>Tünde Varga (Paks (Hungary) turit@axelero.hu
<p>The world will miss her. Michelle was my assistant director for my
       original stage play of "What's the Matter with Sara Jane?" and
       directed my first native American play, "The Return of the
       Windigo?" She was ill during both of them, but you would never
       have known it! She was lovely, intelligent, brave, talented, and
       beautiful. I feel honored to have known her. My deepest sympathies
       are with you for having lost this wonderful young woman, and we
       can only hope she is directing plays and shining wherever she is
       now.
