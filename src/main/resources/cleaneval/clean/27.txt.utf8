     <h>Chapter Finale; Courtships Dance  [ Comment ]

   <p>Have you been following this captivating story since the beginning? If
   so you'll be very much pleased to know how things turn out in today's
   8th and last chapter of Courtships Dance!

     <p>The morning brought clear blue skies and a crisp cool feel in the
     air, a reminder that fall was arriving. The groups parted
     cheerfully trading reminders of future events and gatherings.
     <p>The group arrived just before noon at Druim Cain, with Stephros and
     Libhita pausing to speak with the Captain of the Keep while the
     rest waited.

   <p>Mythic's bimonthly staff meeting.

     <p>Just a head's up - we'll be closing the phones at 6:00 PM for their
     bimonthly staff meeting. All other services will continue unabated,
     sort of like this heat wave we've got here in North America this

     <p>I'm leaving at oh-dark-oh-my-goodness tomorrow for sunny San Diego

     passes for affection in MMOs, aka our Camelot Roadtrip. Oh, and

   <h>A Friar's tale...  [ 2 Comments ]
   <p>I proudly present to you this story entitled For the Soul of a Woman
   written by Ranorian! Enjoy!

     <p>As dawn rose over the Southern Black Mountains of Albion, the
     red-tinged rays crept over the great bridge leading from Camelot
     and Ludlow to the barely civilized northern lands of Albion. But
     the bridge was not silent as it usually was in this early hour. Two
     men stood facing each other across the bridge, stationed at either
     side. On the northern side a small bluish creature calmly gazed
     across, a long whip with vicious spikes strung along it was slung
     easily at his side.

     <h>Updated Character Builder - Charplan v1.5.6
   <p>Tired of not having any good (ok, updated) character builders to
   figure out how you want to spec your toons? Affek spotted this rather
   snazzy character builder from hell which you can download from
   Sourceforge.
   <p>I downloaded and tried it myself, it's pretty nice.

   <h>Courtships Dance returns!  [ Comment ]
   <p>After a short summer break, our regular column schedule is back on
   it's feet! So here's the seventh installment of Courtships Dance by
   Miss Saeraphyna!

     <p>Melann nodded from the wall top as three groups headed out the
     front gate towards the Albion encampment. Ggranger and Humanmullet
     patrolled the wall top along with Wynntr and Cinir. Ssnark
     carefully closed the gate and shot the bolt home after the last
     person had exited the keep. The firbolg warden quickly mounted the
     stairs to join the rest of the defenders. Eager eyes watched the
     departing groups wishing that they could be a part of the attack.

   <h>Grab Bag Evasions
   <p>In this week's action-packed Grab Bag Sanya tries to explain how evade
   actually works (I always thought it was based on dex/quick, the level
   of evade, and the to-hit bonus of your attacker), the tower in Bri
   Leith, to-hit modifiers for styles, confuse spells in rvr, timers in
   /use and /use 2, cleric smite healing, trophy hunting and tougher than
   usual monsters in POC.

   <h>Hot Fixes  [ Comment ]
   <p>A couple of hot fixes for a Friday afternoon.

     <p>Just two:
     <l>- The Dexterity version of the Crown of Zahur should be able to
     level off any monster or player kill.
     <l>- All of the Mad Tales will be removed from the players inventory
     and replaced with the final book upon combining the scrolls.

   <h>Thane Gone Wild in Albion Housing  [ 55 Comments ]
   <p>Was it worth the five-day ban? After watching this video of a thane
   getting inside the Albion housing zone on the Killibury Cluster, I
   think it was. The movie runs for 3:51 and features a funky Wham
   soundtrack. Thanks Darkmoonprincess.

   <h>Player Spotlight featuring Tuneses  [ Comment ]
   <p>The Dark Age of Camelot Vault would like to introduce its newest
   feature, spotlighting the guilds and players of Dark Age of Camelot.
   Our next interview comes from a player currently in Midgard on the
   Gareth server. Telling us about herself is Tuneses!

     <h>GENERAL PLAYER QUESTIONS
     <p>Camelot Vault: Any real life info? Age, profession, location?
     <p>Tuneses: 26,F, Tech Support, newly emigrated from Canada to
     Pennsylvania, USA; and I like long walks on the Beach.
     <p>CV: When did you start playing DAOC?
     <p>Tuneses: I got the game for Christmas 2001.
     <h>TAILORED PLAYER QUESTIONS
     <p>CV: Why do you personally still play DAOC after all these years?
     <p>Tuneses: Couple of reasons. Main reason is that it's something both
     my husband and I enjoy a lot. Why DAOC specifically? I think there
     is so much to do with 3 realms and it seems to stay fresh. The PvP
     system is the best out there at the moment, and there is nothing
     more fun then killing players. I will be trying out Warhammer and
     that would be the only game to make me leave DAOC.

   <p>Here are a few screenshots of Tuneses ingame.

   <p>Click here to read the rest of the interview
   <p>The Dark Age of Camelot Vault now has a guild and player spotlight
   section! Each week, we will spotlight a different guild or player with
   a short questionnaire. While we will provide you with the interview
   questions, we will gladly accept any information that you wish to
   provide. This includes your website, screenshots, stories, major
   achievements/events you have been involved in, etc. If you or your
   guild are interested in being interviewed, send Laighean a PM!

   <h>CS Needs YOU  [ 11 Comments ]
   <p>If you've always wanted to work at Mythic, here's your chance!

     <p>If you want to be a game artist, you need to have studied art.
     Ditto programming. But if you want to be a world builder and work
     your way up to designer, the best way in is to start in customer
     service and impress everyone with how smart, creative, and
     hardworking you are. We're about to have another round of
     promotions from the CS pool, but we can't promote those deserving
     men and women until their replacements are trained. That
     replacement could be you... and it could be you moving to building
     and design in 2007. So apply, already:

   <h>Matt Firor Leaves Mythic  [ 141 Comments ]
   <p>Broken Toys (the blog of the artist formerly known as Lum the Mad) is
   reporting that long-time Dark Age of Camelot Producer and Vice
   President of Mythic Matt Firor is no longer with the company:

     <p>TASS is authorized to announce that Matt Firor is no longer with EA
     Mythic. He headed up the development of DAOC as its producer
     through launch, first expansion, and thereafter.
     <p>When I mention the good people that I left behind at Mythic, Firor
     was on that list. He was very much involved in the nuts and bolts
     of game development, and had a very realistic attitude towards what
     was possible and fun.
     <p>Firor on the stress of balancing a live game: Everybody that wants
     their character to be more powerful, raise their hands! (gleefully
     waves arms in air)

   <p>It looks like he'll be starting up his own studio.
