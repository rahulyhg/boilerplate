<h>Some VERY interesting information on 666

<h>   by Ragnar Redbeard

                                                         

<p>   From: "Ragnar Redbeard"

<p>   It has been suggested in this newsgroup (alt.christianity) in response
   to my question regarding the origin of 666 that the number 666 has its
   roots in numerology. This is the school of thought that agree with.
   The number 666 has its origins in ancient numerology / astrology, and
   is connected to what are called "magic squares". The ancients devised
   a scheme of numbers arranged in squares and ordered in such a way that
   by adding each row and column, one would reach the same total each
   time. 666 comes from the square associated with the Sun, which is made
   up of every number from 1 to 36. The sum of all numbers from 1 to 36
   is of course, 666. Surrounding the Sun Square are the 12 divisibles of
   666 which are attached to the 12 signs of the Zodiac.

<l>   666 = Pisces
<l>   333 = Aquarius
<l>   222 = Capricorn
<l>   111 = Sagitaurus
<l>   74 = Scorpio
<l>   37 = Libra
<l>   18 = Virgo
<l>   9 = Leo
<l>   6 = Cancer
<l>   3 = Gemini
<l>   2 = Taurus
<l>   1 = Aries

<p>   Here is what the Sun Square looks like:

<l>   6 32 3 34 35 1
<l>   7 11 27 28 8 30
<l>   19 14 16 15 23 24
<l>   18 20 22 21 17 13
<l>   25 29 10 9 26 12
<l>   36 5 33 4 2 31

<p>   The factors of 666 are 666, 333, 222, 111, 74, 37, 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, and
   1. They are attached to the Zodiac signs as follows:

<p>   So, each of the six rows has a total of 111 (6 rows x 111 = 666). Each
   of the 6 columns also has a total of 111.

<p>   The Sun Square contains 9 squares and rectangles whose corners total
   74 ( 9 X 74 = 666 ) One example is "6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74"

<p>   For those who practiced numerology / astrology, the numbers 666 and 74
   were considered 'holy' numbers, associated with the Sun, which they
   revered. Numerology / Astrology (from now on referred to as Hermetica)
   also became a recurring phenomenon in the bible, particularely the
   KJV. Many of the numbers which are sacred to Hermetica are found to be
   recurring throughout the KJV, 666 being the most obvious.

<p>  The famous reference to 666 is found in revelation, but another exists
   in 1 Kings 10:14 where Solomon takes 666 talents of gold from
   neighboring kingdoms. Solomon is one of the more important examples of
   this biblically coded wisdom.

<p>   Solomon is basically the figure head of the 12 tribes of Israel during
   his reign as king. Solomon represents the Sun and the Sun Square and
   the 12 tribes of Israel are the 12 signs of the Zodiac. The 666 clue
   found in 1 Kings is one hint - another is the name Solomon. "Sol" is
   the Latin word for the Sun, "Om" is the Hindi word for the Sun, and
   "On" is the Egyptian word for the Sun.

<p>   While 666 is the most famous reference to the practice of Numerology
   found in the bible, there are many others which are more subtle. First
   a quick point regarding history:

<p>   In approximately 325 A.D. Emperor Constantine declared Christianity to
   be the official religion of the Roman Empire. His reasons are the
   topic of another discussion, but for better or worse it is a fact. For
   the next 1500 years, all other religions or philosophies were
   ruthlessly purged from the Roman Empire, to the point of knowledge of
   many ancient religions becoming extinct. The Ancients, realizing that
   practicing Hermetica (Numerology / Astrology) meant a visit to the
   torture chamber, did what anyone in their position would do - they hid
   their knowledge. The were fortunate in the fact that they were
   practically the only ones with any sort of education, and thus were
   trusted to read, write, and interpret for Rome. Fast forward to
   somewhere in the 1600's when King James decided that the bible should
   be available in English and commissioned a group of scholars including
   Francis Bacon* to oversee the translation of the bible from Hebrew &
   Latin to English. Francis Bacon was a member of the chain of minds
   that sprang from the Ancient Philosophers and he constructed the KJV
   in such a way that the knowledge they possessed may be preserved. All
   one has to do is decipher it.

<p>   Now, with that in mind, we can look at the bible and understand why it
   is arranged the way it is. If someone was to write a code without
   leaving any sort of decoding manual, it stands to reason that the
   means of decoding his work would have to be included in his work. The
   first step to deciphering this code would be to look for extremes.
   Take for example, Psalm 117. It sits at the exact center of the bible
   (in traditional order) and is the shortest chapter in the bible. As
   such, it almost jumps out and screams "Hey, look at me!" Psalms 117
   has exactly 33 words. By no coincidence there are 33 years in the life
   of Christ, and 33 generations from Adam to David.

<p>   *There are those who believe that it was Francis Bacon who wrote the
   works attributed to Shakespeare. Here is a little tidbit suggestive of
   this theory. Count 666 chapters backwards from the end of the bible.
   You will find that it is Psalm 46. Count 46 words into that chapter
   and find that the 46th word is "Shake". Count 46 words backwards from
   the end of that chapter and find that the 46th word is "spear". The
   mathematical laws of probability eliminate the "coincidence" theory,
   and we conclude that with this method of "counting the bible" rather
   than reading the bible we are on the right track.

<p>   Due to a period of over one thousand years in which anything other
   than Church approved subject matter was relentlessly purged, intimate
   knowledge of pre-Christian religious practices (particularely those
   related to Numerology) is scarce. Some rudimentary information still
   remains, such as the names and fables associated with the Pagan lore,
   along with some fundamental Numerology / Astrology concepts. Many are
   familiar with the tales of Thor, Odin (Wotan, Woden), Zues, and the
   whole pantheon of gods and goddesses. The horoscopic information that
   exists in today's New Age circles consists mainly of simple
   clairvoyance and "love spells". Many New Age occultists use the
   principles of Gematria and such to discover "their" number, and so on.

<p>   Ancient 'magicians' used 7 unique number squares as the basis for
   their wisdom. Each square was arranged in such a way that the total of
   any column or row was the same. Each of the seven 'magic' squares was
   also assigned a planetary value. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn,
   Jupiter, the Moon, and the Sun, are all associated with a specific
   square. It is the Sun Square that is most relevent to bible coding.
   The sun square is the 4th of the 7 magic squares and consists of every
   number from 1 to 36, arranged in six rows and six columns. Each of the
   six rows adds up to 111 and each of the six columns adds to 111. It is
   from the Magic Square of the Sun that the infamous number 666
   originates. 6 columns X 111 = 666. 6 rows X 111 = 666. All of the
   numbers 1 through 36 total 666. There are a total of 3 squares and 6
   rectangles within the Sun Square, each of which adds to 74, and are
   listed below. 9 rectangles & squares X 74 = 666.

<l>   6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74

<l>   11 + 8 + 26 + 29 = 74

<l>   16 + 15 + 21 + 22 = 74

<l>   7 + 3 + 12 + 25 = 74

<l>   19 + 24 + 13 + 18 = 74

<l>  32 + 35 + 2 + 5 = 74

<l>   3 + 34 + 4 + 33 = 74

<l>   14 + 23 + 17 + 20 = 74

<l>   27 + 28 + 9 + 10 = 74

<p>   The numbers to keep track of here are 9, 74, and 666, as they will
   turn up elsewhere later.

<p>   Very possibly, the other squares contain number patterns that can be
   found in the bible, but our focus will remain with the Sun Square. The
   number 666 has 12 divisibles, and these divisibles are associated with
   the 12 signs of the Zodiac. The Sun Square and its 12 divisibles (or
   12 signs of the Zodiac) serve to form a theme which was to become
   common in many later religions. Odin had 12 chief priests, Solomon had
   12 tribes of Israel, and Jesus had 12 disciples. The 1 + 12 phenomenon
   is found in other areas as well. In U.S. courts, there is a Judge, and
   twelve jurors. Anglo-Saxon folklore tells of King Arthur and twelve
   Knights of the Round Table. Upon reflection this should be an obvious
   analogue as King Arthur and the Round Table represent the Sun and the
   Sun Square, and the 12 Knights represent the 12 signs of the Zodiac.

<p>   It should be clear that the chances of these religions and folklore
   sharing the 1 + 12 theme being a coincidence is gradually falling.
   Furthermore, since the 1 + 12 theme appears primarily in Western
   religions, it is likely that they originate from one source. This
   source has been given many names throughout the centuries and usually
   takes the form of secret societies. At one point it was discovered
   that certain sounds affected the subconcious mind, and it was long
   known that the human animal is a herd animal. Perceptive people
   realized that the two should be mixed very carefully. Some sound
   arrangements had a soothing effect, while some had an angering effect,
   or a saddening effect. Ancient temples were often constructed in such
   a way that the songs sung during services would have a maximum effect
   on the mass. Certain notes can shatter glass, or render humans
   unconcious, and it was this power that these societies intended to
   conceal. Unscrupulous people could easily use this knowledge to the
   detriment of society. When languages were constructed, their vowels
   and consonants were assigned numerical values. The study of this
   alphabetic / numerical association is called Gematria, and Gematria is
   used to assign numbers to sounds (words, phrases, etc.).

<p>   Deities, or important figures in mythology and religion are
   constructed in accordance with the principles outlined above. English
   Gematria assigns the value of "1" to the letter "A", and "2" to the
   letter "B", etc. With this in mind, look at the word "Jesus":

<p>   J E S U S

<p>   10 + 5 + 19 + 21 + 19 = 74

<p>   Let it also be known that the word Jesus in Greek adds to "888" in
   Greek Gematria. Greek Gematria increases by a factor of 10 each 8
   characters, and the 24th characther has a value of 800. Jesus is
   referred to as being the offspring of David throughout the bible, and
   that referrence is due to the fact that the numerical value of Jesus
   can be found in the Mars Square. If the Star of David is drawn in the
   Mars Square, and the numbers in the Mars Square are reduced to single
   digits, we observe the following phenomenon:

<l>   2 6 7 2 3

<l>   4 3 7 8 7

<l>   8 5 4 3 9

<l>   1 9 1 5 4

<l>   5 6 1 2 6

<p>   After drawing the Star of David inside this square, we see that the
   points on the two triangles collect the numbers in such a way that
   each triangle has a value of 741. The first triangle has the tip at
   the number '7' in the first row, and its two base points sit at 4 and
   1, if we travel clockwise. The inverted triangle has its upper right
   point at the 7 in the last column, and travels across the column to
   arrive at the 4 in the first column, and finally the 1 at the tip.
   Inside the hexagram that the center of the Star forms, we see the
   number 741 travel down the vertical axis and the number 543 travel
   across the horizontal axis. 741 + 147 = 888 and 543 + 345 = 888. This
   is why Jesus is referred to as a branch of David.

<p>   Note that the word "Joshua" adds to "74" in the same way Jesus does,
   and incidentally so does the word "occult".

<p>   Even though it is thought to be common knowledge that a man named
   "Shakespeare" wrote the collection of classic plays, an interesting
   'coincidence' is found by employing the coding concepts used by
   Francis Bacon (who supervised the writing of the KJV). If we count 666
   chapters backwards from the end of the bible, we arrive at Psalm 46.
   Excluding the mysterious word "selah" (which appears 74 times
   throughout the KJV) we count 46 words from the beginning of the
   chapter and find the 46th word to be "shake". The 46th word from the
   end of the chapter is "spear". This is coincidental to the theory held
   by some that Francis Bacon wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare

<p>   When constructing a code that is designed to be deciphered without a
   'decoder's guide' a cryptographer will use extremes as pointers to
   show us the structure of the code. Tools such as longest, shortest,
   and repetition serve to draw attention. In keeping with this theory,
   we notice that the shortest chapter in the bible, Psalm 117, is also
   placed in the exact center. It contains exactly 33 words, which by no
   coincidence is the number of years in the life of Christ, the number
   of generations from Adam to David, and the number of degrees in
   Freemasonry.

<p>   On counting sets of 33 chapters from the beginning of the bible we
   find that the 9th set lands on 1 Kings 6. 9 sets of 33 chapters
   backwards from Psalm 117, we find that the 9th set lands on 1 Kings 7.
   The chapters 1 Kings 6 and 1 Kings 7 detail the construction of
   Solomon's Temple. The Temple is begun in 1 Kings 6, and construction
   ends in 1 Kings 7.

<p>   Due to the fact that the word "temple" is often associated with
   perfected man, and wisdom, a great deal of coding can be found within
   the biblical concept of Solomon. The word "Solomon" serves a dual
   purpose in the coding of the bible. The word "Sol" is Latin for "sun",
   the word "Om" is Hindi for "sun" and the word "On" is Egyptian for
   "sun". Also, the vowel "o" is symmetrically placed throughout the word
   3 times. Note that "o" is the 15th letter in the alphabet:

<l>   O O O

<l>   15 15 15

<l>  1 + 5 1 + 5 1 + 5 = 666

<p>  Even when presented with information such as this, the Christians will
   grow stronger in their proclaimations that the practice of Numerology
   is evil. Sometimes it will be suggested that perhaps this coding was
   designed by the devil to discredit the 'truth' of Christianity.
   Nonetheless Solomon was designed to code 666 and the Sun Square, and
   makes references to the 'temple', all of which are concepts borrowed
   from the ancient Occult.

<p>   Not unlike the 1 + 12 theme, the recurrence of the number "7" in
   religion and mythology is significant. The Seven Seals of Revelation
   is a reference to the 7 magic Squares, as are other references to 7 in
   the bible:

<p>  Seven horns and seven eyes are the seven spirits of God (Rev 5:6),
   Seven lamps of fire which are the seven spirits of God (Rev 4:5) are
   all references to the 7 magic squares.

<p>   Sometimes methods other than Gematria and Numerological coding are
   used, and in Revelation 2:17 we discover coded in that verse the
   belief system held by Francis Bacon and the Initiates who wrote the
   King James Bible. Revelation 2:17 reads

<p>   "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
   churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden
   manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name
   written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it"

<p>   In this case, the passage points to a new name written in 'a white
   stone'. If one were to unscramble the words 'a white stone' we will
   get 'thee is wotan'. Remember Wotan is a deity in the pantheon known
   as Asatru, and sometimes goes by the name 'Woden' or 'Odin'. The odds
   on that being a coincidence simply cannot be fathomed.

<p>   Other than the passages to be unscrambled ("a white stone" - "thee is
   wotan") and the subtle references to the magic squares, most of the
   words in the bible are 'filler', which serve no real interpretive
   purpose. The bible is so full of contradictions and pure nonsense that
   it only stands to reason that it was not meant to be read, but
   counted. Other theories suggest that the King James bible was written
   as a time-bomb designed to destroy Christianity. Others suggest that
   Christianity in general was designed to destroy the West, and that the
   KJV was designed to warn us and was coded to preserve ancient wisdom.
   Both theories fit the facts outlined above, but it is doubtful that
   the whole story will ever be known.

<p>   Now that the coding system has been discovered, the dominoes will
   begin to fall. Given enough time, we can no doubt unravel all of the
   wisdom encoded into the KJV and discover the knowledge known only by a
   few, and persecuted by religious tyrants for hundreds of years. This
   essay outlined a few pointers and coding principles and the reader is
   encouraged to discover more. Remember, count the bible, don't read it!
