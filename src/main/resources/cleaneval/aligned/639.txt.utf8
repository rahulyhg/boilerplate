WE DID WALK TO SEE THE MOUNTAIN LILAC BUSH NEARBY.. MOUNTAIN LILAC IN THE---- DESERT? RARE, THIS IS THE ONLY ONE - NOW BLOOMING WITH BEAUTIFUL DELICATE LAVENDER---- FLOWERS. EVERY SPRING WE WALK TO SEE THIS RARE FLOWERING BUSH.----------- WE-ARE RECEIVING MORE REQUESTS ALL THE TIME - LETTERS AND PHONE CALLS FROM AROUND THE ----WORLD. WE ARE NOT A BIG ENOUGH OPERATION TO DO JUSTICE TO IT ALL. FOR INSTANCE, WE RECEIVE---- MANY LETTERS WITH STORIES ABOUT WHERE AND HOW YOU FOUND PEACE PILGRIM'S MESSAGE AND HOW IT---- HAS AFFECTED YOUR-LIVES. I PUT THOSE LETTERS WITH GOOD QUOTES-AND STORIES IN A SPECIAL ----SHELF AND HAVE USUALLY BEEN ABLE TO GO THROUGH THEM. BUT I HAVEN'T HAD TIME, AND HERE IT---- IS-NEWSLETTER TIME!

SEE PAGES------------------ 6 & SEVERAL FRIENDS ARE CONCERNED THAT WE NEED MORE ROOM FOR OUR-VERY IMPORTANT WORK. NANCY---- POER, A TEACHER OF WALDORF SCHOOL TEACHERS WOULD LIKE THE PEACE PILGRIM CENTER TO BE NEXT---- TO THEIR RANCH NEAR PLACERVILLE IN THE-FOOTHILLS OF THE SIERRAS, A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOODED---- AREA. IN OUR NEXT NEWSLETTER, WE PLAN ON PRINTING MORE ABOUT OUR GROWING NEED FOR A---- LARGER, ON-GOING, PERMANENT PEACE PILGRIM CENTER. SOME OF THESE FRIENDS FORMED A COMMITTEE---- CALLED:----- "FRIENDS OF FRIENDS OF PEACE PILGRIM-----" TO HELP US GROW.----------- ANOTHER FRIEND, KATHY MILLER- WHO HAS GIVEN OVER HER HOME TO THE DOCUMENTARY CREW, HAS---- LOVED SO MUCH BEING A PART OF A PEACE PILGRIM OPERATION THAT SHE WANTS TO SPEND HER---- RETIREMENT YEARS HELPING TO SPREAD HER MESSAGE.----------- HERE ARE SOME SAMPLES OF OUR DAYS: A CALL FROM HOLLAND FOR MORE STEPS FOR HER---- PILGRIMAGE TO JERUSALEM. ONE DAY WE PACKAGED BOXES OF BOOKS FOR INDIA, ALASKA AND---- THAILAND. ON ANOTHER DAY WE HAD A PHONE CALL AND FAX FROM ALASKA, A FAMILY OF FOUR FROM---- JAPAN, AND A CALL FROM A GROUP IN ALASKA STUDYING PEACE'S BOOK ONCE A WEEK. WE PACKAGED A---- BOX OF BOOKS FOR AN INDIAN WHO WANTS-TO TRANSLATE THE BOOK INTO GANDHI'S LANGUAGE----, GUJARATI. MEERA BHATT, A DEVOTED GANDHIAN WORKER, HAS TRANSLATED STEPS INTO GUJARATI AND---- ALSO PLANS ON TRANSLATING THE BOOK. WE HOPE THEY HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER ON THIS PROJECT.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------       1999 PEACE WALK------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (BACK TO TOC)------------------ FROM TEMPORARY TIMES, A PRISON NEWSLETTER------------------ THE PEACE WALK---- WAS BORN OUT OF A THERAPY GROUP WATCHING A DOCUMENTARY VIDEO---- CALLED, THE SPIRIT OF PEACE. THE WALK WAS DESIGNED TO LAST FOR ONE WEEK WITH STRONG---- SUPPORT. THE PROJECT GREW INTO THE ENTIRE MONTH OF OCTOBER...WALKING FOR PEACE. IT IS---- PLEDGED THAT EACH CANDIDATE CARRY OUT A ONE-HALF HOUR WALK, UP TO 2-3 DAYS A WEEK DURING---- MORNING, AFTERNOON OR EVENING YARD PERIODS.----------- THE PURPOSE OF THIS WALK IS TO PROMOTE PEACE AND IT IS NOT LIMITED TO PEACE FOLLOWING A---- VIOLENT ACT OR A WAR, BUT ALSO FOR THE PAIN OR DISTRESS THAT WE GO THROUGH AS INMATES.---- THIS ALSO SYMBOLIZES PARTICIPATION IN THE 1999 PEACE MOVEMENT. ON JANUARY 1, 1999, THE---- PEACE MOVEMENT BEGAN A RUN THAT HAS A RUNNER IN IT 24 HOURS A DAY, UNTIL DECEMBER 31,---------- IT IS DESIGNED TO COVER ALL COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. THE SUBJECT OF THE VIDEO, PEACE---- PILGRIM, WALKED OVER 25,000 MILES IN THE NAME OF PEACE, INSPIRED THE CLASS TO COME---- TOGETHER AND PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THE PEACE MOVEMENT OF------ (THE PEACE WALK WAS---- SUPPORTED BY MANY ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS.---------------------------------------------------------)       RUSSIA---- - I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE STEPS BOOKLET WHICH I---- FIND SO INTERESTING AND WONDERFUL BOOKLET TO BE.----------- I AM A GUY OF ABOUT 19 YEARS OF AGE. IT'S A CURIOUS FACT THAT I WOULDN'T SAY I LIKE---- PORING OVER BOOKS, BUT DESPITE THIS I FOUND MYSELF SO GREATLY INTENT WITH IT. I'M AFRAID I---- CANNOT HOPE TO CONVEY TO YOU A CORRECT FEELING THAT AFFECTED ME ON READING THIS BOOKLET.---- FOR ONE THING IT LEFT AN INDELIBLE IMPRESSION UPON MY MIND AND IT DID GIVE ME FOOD FOR---- CONTEMPLATION AND PUT ME IN A MOOD OF REFLECTIONS.----------- AFTER HAVING READ IT SEVERAL TIMES THE INCLINATION TO FIGURE OUT-MORE WAS AWAKENED. I-----THINK THAT ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A THING PROPERLY INTO ONE'S UNDERSTANDING WITHOUT---- COMPREHENDING IT. THEREFORE REFERRING TO THE MENTION OF OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING PEACE---- PILGRIM BOOK, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT SENT TO MY ADDRESS. I MAKE SURE I CAN UNDERSTAND-----ENGLISH THERE'S NO DIFFICULTY IN READING IT IN ORIGINAL. I AM SO INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU---- IN ADVANCE.--------------------------------------------------------------       PEACE PILGRIM-------------- - "OUR LIVES ARE ORDERED AND ARRANGED FOR US IN---- MANY WONDERFUL WAYS IF WE ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN.-------------------------------------------------------------------"       PRISONER--------- - FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO-THANK GOD FOR ALL OF YOU. I AM---- READING THE PEACE PILGRIM BOOK. BY THE TIME I HAD READ UP TO PAGE 45 I HAD TO STOP AND---- WRITE MY WIFE AND TELL HER ABOUT THE BOOK. I AM 44 YEARS OF AGE AND I HAVE NEVER READ A---- MORE HEART-FELT BOOK. IT HAS GIVEN ME MORE INSIGHT TO GOD THAN THE BIBLE AND THAT'S---- BECAUSE I'M READING ABOUT A PERSON WHO LIVED THE-BIBLE. HE ASKS FOR A-COPY TO BE SENT TO---- HIS WIFE.----------------------------------------------------------------------------       PEN PALS--------------------------------------------------------- (BACK---- TO TOC)------------------- BY DAN MENKIN, 11408, FRANCIS PLACE, LA, CA---------------- 90066 SEVERAL YEARS AGO I CONNECTED WITH CHRIS, ANOTHER READER OF THIS NEWSLETTER, WHO LIVES---- IN A PRISON. WE BEGAN A RICH AND REWARDING CORRESPONDENCE, EXPLORING MANY IDEAS ASSOCIATED---- WITH INNER PEACE.----------- IN THE SUMMER OF 1998 I LEARNED THAT CHRIS WAS WORKING 60 HOURS A WEEK AT HIS PRISON--------- "JOB,-----" RECEIVING ABOUT 15 CENTS AN HOUR SO THAT HE COULD SAVE MONEY TO BUY HIS---- DAUGHTER A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THAT FALL. HIS HEALTH WAS SUFFERING, AND HE DIDN'T HAVE ENERGY---- FOR ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS SHARING WHAT HE WAS LEARNING ABOUT INNER PEACE WITH THE OTHER---- PRISONERS.----------- AFTER RECEIVING HIS LETTER EXPLAINING THIS SITUATION, I WAS GIVEN AN INSPIRATION; IT---- SEEMED SO RIGHT AND LOVELY THAT I SENT THE FOLLOWING PROPOSAL TO HIM: IF YOU WILL CUT OUT---- BACK YOUR----- "WORK-----" HOURS, I WILL PAY YOU DOUBLE WHAT YOU ARE EARNING---- (30 CENTS/HOUR - BIG DEAL!) TO ORGANIZE AND LEAD A PEACE PILGRIM STUDY GROUP THERE. THREE---- NIGHTS A WEEK, THREE HOURS EACH NIGHT, FOR TEN WEEKS WILL EARN YOU-$27, ENOUGH FOR THE ----GIFT YOU WANT TO BUY.----------- TO SWEETEN THE OFFER A BIT, I ALSO OFFERED TO SEND AN EQUAL AMOUNT TO THE PEACE PILGRIM---- CENTER TO HELP PAY FOR ANY MATERIALS THEY SENT HIM FOR THE STUDY GROUP. I KEPT HIS ACCRUED--------- "SALARY-----" AND ORDERED VARIOUS MAIL ORDER CATALOGUES TO BE SENT TO HIM WHEN HE---- DECIDED ON THE TOY HE WANTED FOR HIS DAUGHTER. I ORDERED AND PAID FOR IT WITH HIS--------- "EARNINGS-----" FROM OUR AGREEMENT, BYPASSING THE BUREAUCRACY OF THE PRISON SYSTEM---- AND ASSURING HIS DAUGHTER RECEIVED HER GIFT FROM DADDY ON TIME.----------- I WILL NEVER KNOW WHOSE HEARTS WERE TOUCHED BY LEARNING ABOUT PEACE PILGRIM IN THIS---- WAY, BUT IT SURE MADE ME FEEL GOOD! IT IS RARE IN MY LIFE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE SUCH A---- MEANINGFUL GIFT FOR SO LITTLE-EXPENDITURE. AND I HAD THE ADDED BLESSING OF KNOWING THAT-MY---- FRIEND, WHOSE HEALTH WAS NOT THE GREATEST, WAS WORKING LESS AND OPENING HIMSELF MORE TO---- PEACE'S LIFE AND WORDS THROUGH SHARING THEM WITH OTHERS.----------- FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, YOU CAN WRITE TO MY FRIEND DIRECTLY: CHRIS DEWALT, NO.---- 35662, UNIT 02, P.O DRAWER 1328, LOS LUNAS, NM-------------------------------------------------------------------- 87031-      ILLINOIS--------- - I KEEP PEACE PILGRIM AT MY BEDSIDE AS A READY SOURCE OF---- INSPIRATION.------------------------- PRISONER--------- - HI, I'VE GOTTEN HOLD OF THE PEACE BOOKLET AND IT IS STARTING---- TO CHANGE MY LIFE.

AS I LOOK AT THE-WORD--------- "GRATEFULNESS-----" IT DOESN'T BEGIN TO TELL WHAT I REALLY FEEL. IT IS SOMETHING MORE---- DEEPER AND STRONGER. THE BOOK MAKES ME SO EXCESSIVELY HAPPY INDEED, FOR THAT I AM---- INFINITELY INDEBTED TO YOU.----------- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MESSAGE----- "OVERCOME EVIL, ETC SHOULD BE MADE KNOWN TO---- EVERYONE ON EARTH, BECAUSE IT POINTS THE WAY TO THE FUTURE DESTINY OF THE WORLD. HOWEVER---- MY ATTEMPTS TO SHARE THE MESSAGE WITH MY FRIENDS ARE IN VAIN. THEY JUST LET IT GO BY. I---- THINK THAT OUR LIVES ARE BECOMING MORE BUSY NOWADAYS. WE RUN FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER---- FOCUSING ON THE EPHEMERAL, WHEREAS WE ARE SUPPOSED, AS I AM WILLING TO BELIEVE, TO SPEND---- SOME TIME WITH OURSELVES IN INTROSPECTION, IN DEVELOPMENT.----------- PERSONALLY, BY DOING SO IT WAS A NEW START-FOR ME, AND THE BOOK HELPED ME A LOT IN MANY---- WAYS. I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE THE PROGRESSION OF MINE. HOW WELL DO I REMEMBER ONE-EVENING DARK---- AND STARRY, WHEN I WAS READING THE BOOK AND MY MOM SHOWED A FRIENDLY INTEREST IN IT. WHAT---- ONCE SOUNDED STRANGE AND UNBELIEVABLE NOW SOUNDS REASONABLE AND PLAUSIBLE. NOWADAYS, I---- TRANSLATE FOR MY MOM WHENEVER MY FREE TIME COINCIDES WITH HERS.

HEROES WILL SPRING UP WHENEVER AND WHEREVER A BURNING CROSS---- APPEARS. ONLY A FEW HOURS AFTER A BURNING CROSS MAKES THE EVENING NEWS, HATEBUSTERS AND---- CLERGY---- & CHURCH PEOPLE WILL APPEAR AT THE VICTIM'S HOME TO PRAY AND SING AND MAKE---- PLANS TO HELP THE FAMILY.------------------------------------------------- HATEBUSTERS-------- & CLERGY---- & CHURCH AGAINST---- RACE VIOLENCE WILL PROMPT CHURCHES---- & SYNAGOGUES---- & POLICE---- & FEDERAL AUTHORITIES---- TO WORK TOGETHER TO APPREHEND AND PROSECUTE CROSS BURNERS.

WHEN THE VERDICT IS RETURNED, WE WILL ANNOUNCE---- TO THE COMMUNITY OUR ASSESSMENT OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE.----------- HATEBUSTERS IS A 501 C-3 NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION, DEDICATED TO OPPOSING HATE, TEACHING---- PEOPLE HOW TO LIKE ONE ANOTHER. HATEBUSTERS WAS FOUNDED IN 1988 WHEN A MEMBER OF THE KU---- KLUX KLAN WAS ELECTED TO LOUISIANA LEGISLATURE. THE GOVERNOR INVITED US TO COME AND HELP---- THE STATE REDEEM ITSELF. CLERGY AND CHURCH AGAINST RACE VIOLENCE ORGANIZED IN 1998 WHEN A---- CROSS WAS BURNED IN KANSAS CITY, KANSAS. LOCAL CLERGY LED A SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITY EFFORT TO---- SECURE A CONVICTION AND EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF CROSS BURNING.----------- WHEN CROSSES ARE BURNED, WE GET ON THE TELEPHONE---- & INTERNET, CONTACT RELIGIOUS-------- & POLITICAL LEADERS IN THE TOWN WHERE THE CROSS WAS BURNED. WITH OUR HELP, LOCAL---- LEADERS BRING TOGETHER CITIZENS OF THE COMMUNITY, AND WITHIN 72 HOURS OF THE CROSS BURNING---- EVERYONE COMES TO THE VICTIM'S HOME. TV AND NEWSPAPER REPORTERS COME, AND NEWS OF THE---- CROSS BURNING IS OVER-RIDDEN BY NEWS OF GOOD PEOPLE DOING BOLD AND NOBLE DEEDS. REDEMPTION---- HAS BEGUN. THE ONE OR TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WHO BURNED THE CROSS HAVE AROUSED HUNDREDS----, THOUSANDS WHO COME TO PRAYER VIGILS, SIGN STATEMENTS CONDEMNING CROSS BURNING, SEND MONEY---- TO AID VICTIMS AND WRITE LOVE LETTERS TO ENCOURAGE THEM.----------- SIX CROSSES HAVE BEEN BURNED IN GREATER KANSAS CITY SINCE------ SEVEN MEN HAVE GONE TO---- FEDERAL PRISON FOR BURNING CROSSES - HUNDREDS TO PRAYER VIGILS. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE---- PUBLICLY CONDEMNED CROSS BURNING. THOUSANDS WROTE LOVE LETTERS TO VICTIMS. ON APRIL---- 11, 2000, 37 RESIDENTS OF GREATER KANSAS CITY WERE RECOGNIZED AS HATEBUSTER HEROES FOR THEIR---- LEADERSHIP IN ORGANIZING A MASSIVE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THIS ASSAULT ON OUR COMMUNITY, AN---- INSULT TO OUR HOPES OF CREATING A LOVING PLACE TO LIVE. OUR 37 HATEBUSTER HEROES INCLUDED---- HIGH SCHOOL---- & COLLEGE STUDENTS, RABBIS, MAYORS, PREACHERS, CITY MANAGERS, HIGH SCHOOL---- TEACHERS AND COLLEGE PROFESSORS; CHRISTIANS, JEWS, BAHAI'S, HINDUS, MUSLIMS;---- AFRICAN-AMERICANS, ANGLOS AND MEXICAN-AMERICANS. ON THAT APRIL NIGHT EVERY TV NEWS PROGRAM---- IN KANSAS CITY CARRIED A STORY ABOUT OUR HATEBUSTER HEROES. ALL OF GREATER KANSAS CITY SAW---- AND WAS INSPIRED BY THESE 37 HEROES WHO HAD RISEN FROM AMONG US TO LEAD US FROM THOSE SIX---- DARK NIGHTS OF BURNING CROSSES INTO THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF HIGH NOON WHERE WE ALL STAND UP---- AND STAND TOGETHER AGAINST THOSE WHO HATE AND HURT THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US.--------------- SEE NL 21 - HOW PEACE PILGRIM INFLUENCED ED CHASTEEN TO WORK FOR PEACE.

THEREFORE, A FORMAL REQUEST HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE----------------------------------- AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE----, ITSELF A-------------------------------------------------- PAST RECIPIENT---- OF THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE, TO---- NOMINATE PEACE PILGRIM AND THE WORK OF FRIENDS OF PEACE PILGRIM FOR A----------------------------------------------- NOBEL PEACE PRIZE---- IN THE YEAR------ WE---- ENCOURAGE ALL WHO HAVE BEEN-PROFOUNDLY MOVED BY PEACE PILGRIM'S LIFE AND WORK TO WRITE---- LETTERS ON BEHALF OF HER NOMINATION, SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES AND INSIGHTS, SERVING TO---- SUBSTANTIATE HER TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTION TO WORLD PEACE, AND SUPPORTING THE NOBEL PRIZE---- COMMITTEE IN TAKING THIS ACTION.

UNIVERSITY FOR PEACE, COSTA---- RICA, SUGGESTED PLACING A STATUE OF PEACE PILGRIM NEAR THAT OF MAHATMA GANDHI. WE WERE---- THRILLED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY, BUT CAME TO THE CONCLUSION IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE AND---- TIME-CONSUMING FOR US.----------- WE ARE THANKFUL THAT SEVERAL FRIENDS HAVE CREATED A COMMITTEE,----- "FRIENDS OF FRIENDS---- OF PEACE PILGRIM-----" TO HELP US SPREAD HER MESSAGE. MARY NEWSWANGER, A MEMBER OF THIS---- COMMITTEE, IS A QUAKER PACIFIST LIVING IN MONTEVERDE, COSTA-RICA. SHE FOUND A WELL-KNOWN---- COSTA RICAN SCULPTOR WHO WILL CREATE A STATUE OF HER WALKING, FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT.---- MARY HAS SPREAD PEACE PILGRIM'S MESSAGE BEFORE. TWELVE YEARS AGO, AS SECRETARY OF THE---- WIDER QUAKER FELLOWSHIP IN PHILADELPHIA, SHE RECOMMENDED INCLUDING STEPS BOOKLETS IN A---- MAILING TO 3000 PEOPLE IN 80 COUNTRIES. ONE OF THE MANY RESULTS - A PEACE PILGRIM CENTRE---- IN MOSCOW AND PEACE PILGRIM---- & STEPS BOOKLET IN RUSSIAN. IT WILL BE WONDERFUL TO HAVE A---- STATUE OF PEACE PILGRIM IN COSTA RICA, ALONG WITH OTHER OUTSTANDING PEACE ADVOCATES.------------------- VISIONS OF THE STATUE'S INFLUENCE--------- - THE DEDICATION OF THE PEACE---- PILGRIM STATUE IS EXPECTED TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL EVENT OF STATURE TO DRAW THE ATTENTION---- OF THE WORLD TO THIS TIMELY MESSAGE FOR WORLD PEACE. COSTA RICA, THE FIRST COUNTRY WITHOUT---- AN ARMY, IS IN AN UNIQUE POSITION TO HOST SUCH AN EVENT.----------- OUR SCULPTOR HAD THE BEAUTIFUL IDEA OF THE STATUE BEING LEVEL WITH THE GROUND, NOT UPON---- A PEDESTAL. THIS WILL CREATE THE FEELING OF HAVING HER AMONG THE PEOPLE GATHERED AROUND---- HER, WITHOUT A SENSE OF DISTANCE. HE ALSO SUGGESTED HAVING A LEVEL STONE-LIKE FLOOR WITH---- THE WORDS OF HER MISSION,----- "THIS IS THE WAY OF PEACE: OVERCOME EVIL WITH GOOD----, FALSEHOOD WITH TRUTH AND HATRED WITH LOVE-----" WRITTEN IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH.----------- THE GROUNDS OF THE UNIVERSITY ARE BEAUTIFUL. PERHAPS AN INVITING SPACE CAN BE CREATED---- FOR THIS-STATUE, A QUIET PLACE TO WITHDRAW, TO REFLECT BY ONESELF.----------- A SIGN COULD BE PLACED NEARBY DIRECTING VISITORS TO THE LIBRARY WHERE THEY MAY READ THE---- PEACE PILGRIM BOOK AND SEE A PEACE PILGRIM VIDEO, INCLUDING THE DOCUMENTARY. WE WILL HAVE---- BOOKS, STEPS, AUDIO AND VIDEO TAPES FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE. OUR ADDRESS IS ON ALL OUR---- MATERIALS.--------------------------------------------------------------       ARCHDIOCESE OF GUWAHATI, INDIA--------- - WE HAVE GONE THROUGH YOUR STEPS---- BOOKLET AND PEACE PILGRIM BOOK AND FOUND THEM VERY USEFUL. WE ARE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN---- HAVING COPIES OF THESE BOOKS...WE WILL PRAY FOR THE SUCCESS OF YOUR EFFORTS. ALL THE VERY---- BEST IN BRINGING OUT THESE MEANINGFUL BOOKS.------------------- ENGLAND--------- - THANKS FOR SHARING THIS WONDERFUL, UPLIFTING BOOK WITH THE---- WHOLE WORLD. GOD BLESS US ALL.--------------------------------------------------------------       A---------------- VITAL---- MESSAGE--------------------------------------------------------- (BACK TO TOC)--------------- BY ERNEST MORGAN----------- NOW IN MY 95TH YEAR AND WITH FAILING HEALTH, I DON'T EXPECT TO BE AROUND MUCH LONGER.---- BUT I HAVE A VITAL MESSAGE TO LEAVE TO THE WORLD - AND ESPECIALLY IN AMERICA.----------- THE MALDISTRIBUTION OF OWNERSHIP AND INCOME IN OUR COUNTRY IS EXTREME AND IS RAPIDLY---- GETTING WORSE. CHARACTERISTICALLY THE CEOS OF LEADING INDUSTRIES RECEIVE MORE THAN---- 400 TIMES THE PAY THAT THE RANK AND FILE WORKERS GET. SIMILARLY, THE RICHEST ONE PERCENT OF---- THE PEOPLE OWN MORE OF THE PRODUCTIVE RESOURCES THAN DO A LARGE PORTION OF THE REST OF OUR---- SOCIETY.----------- WE ENJOY TEMPORARY PROSPERITY BY THE ASTRONOMICAL EXPANSION OF DEBT. THE FEDERAL DEBT---- IS NOW OVER FIVE AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS, AND PRIVATE DEBT IS EVEN LARGER.----------- HOW CAN WE PRESERVE OUR PROSPERITY? WHAT IS CALLED FOR IS AN ALMOST RELIGIOUS REVIVAL.---- OUR SOCIETY IS DOMINATED BY A PARADIGM OF GREED AND EXPLOITATION. WE MUST AS QUICKLY AS---- POSSIBLE SUBSTITUTE A PARADIGM OF CARING AND SHARING.----------- IT WILL ALREADY BE FOUND IN THE COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT, AND IN SOME-INDIVIDUAL LIVES. MY-----FATHER, ARTHUR E. MORGAN,-DEMONSTRATED IT IN HIS-CAREER. IN HIS ENGINEERING PRACTICE WHEN---- HE HIRED OTHER ENGINEERS TO WORK FOR HIM, HE MADE THEM PARTNERS.----------- IN THE GIANT FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT WHICH HE DIRECTED AT DAYTON, OHIO, THERE WERE FIVE---- HUGE DAMS TO BE BUILT WHICH WOULD TAKE HUNDREDS OF MEN SEVEN YEARS. INSTEAD OF HOUSING---- THESE MEN IN THE USUAL TAR-PAPER SHACKS HE BUILT FIVE BEAUTIFUL VILLAGES IN WOODED AREAS.---- THIS COST A LOT MORE THAN TAR-PAPER SHACKS BUT THE QUALITY AND STABILITY OF THE WORK FORCE---- WERE SO HIGH THAT IT ACTUALLY SAVED MONEY. FURTHERMORE, THE ACCIDENT RATE WAS REDUCED BY---- 85% OVER WHAT WAS EXPECTED IN JOBS OF THAT SIZE, SAVING 30 LIVES.----------- I INHERITED MY FATHER'S PHILOSOPHY. LAUNCHING A BUSINESS IN 1925, I RAN IT FOR---- 44 YEARS, SHARING THE LEADERSHIP AND INCOME WITH MY EMPLOYEES. MY INCOME WAS NOT MUCH HIGHER---- THAN THEIRS, AND I DELIBERATELY RAN THE COMPANY AS A COMMUNITY. I HIRED BLACKS, JAPANESE---- - AMERICANS AND JEWISH REFUGEES FROM EUROPE ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH EVERYONE ELSE. IN THE---- ATMOSPHERE OF COMMUNITY THE ETHNIC DIFFERENCES CEASED TO MATTER. OUR SALES POLICIES WERE---- CAREFULLY DESIGNED TO FIT THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. CARING AND SHARING WAS A GREAT---- SUCCESS.----------- I STRONGLY URGE OUR SOCIETY TO SHIFT TO A PARADIGM OF CARING AND SHARING TO MAKE FREE---- ENTERPRISE A CONTINUING SUCCESS.------------------- PEACE PILGRIM-------------- - "WE HAVE GOODLY AMOUNT OF INDIVIDUAL DEMOCRACY.---- WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS ON SOCIAL DEMOCRACY. WHERE WE FALL THE SHORTEST IS IN ECONOMIC---- DEMOCRACY.-------------------------------------------------------------------"       MID-COURSE CORRECTION--------------- - HE IS THE CEO OF A LARGE COMPANY THAT---- MANUFACTURES CARPET TILES FOR OFFICE, PRIMARILY. HE HAS COME TO MAKE THE DECISION TO---- ATTEMPT TO LEAD HIS COMPANY IN A DIRECTION WHICH WILL HELP HIM CONTRIBUTE TO CREATING A---- SUSTAINABLE WORLD THROUGH PROGRESSIVELY REDUCING THEIR USE OF FOSSIL FUELS AND MATERIALS---- AND ENERGY, AND HAS FOUND THAT HIS COMPANY CAN, IN FACT, BE EVEN MORE PROFITABLE BY SO---- DOING.--------------------------------------------------------------       A CLOISTERED NUN IN INDIA--------- - MAY GOD REWARD YOU FOR THESE BOOKS. WE---- DISTRIBUTE THEM TO OUR VISITORS - THOSE WHO COME TO US SEEKING COMFORT AND CONSOLATION.---- ALSO TO PREACHERS WHO PASTURE GOD'S FLOCK. ALL APPRECIATE THEM.----------- WHAT WE NEED TODAY IS PEACE. THE KINGDOM OF THE PRINCE OF PEACE NEEDS TO BE EXTENDED---- ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE STEPS BOOKLETS ARE VERY PRACTICAL. THE WORLD NEEDS TO LEARN THE---- MAGIC OF FORGIVENESS.----------- WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO PAY YOU IN CASH FOR YOUR GENEROSITY. WE-SHALL CERTAINLY DO IT---- BY OUR POOR PRAYERS. BOTH YOU AND WE SHALL FIGHT THE BATTLE FOR THE SAME CAUSE - PEACE---- THAT PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING. TODAY, INDIA, OUR BELOVED COUNTRY, KNOWN FOR ITS---- SPIRITUALITY, IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EVIL. THE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING - THE RICH BECOME---- RICHER AND THE POOR BECOME POORER.--------------------SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION-------------------- IF YOU WANT FREE PEACE PILGRIM MATERIALS WRITE OR EMAIL US.
