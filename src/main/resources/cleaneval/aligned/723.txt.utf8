BE AWARE THAT EACH- INTERVIEW AND INTERVIEWER IS DIFFERENT AND, AS SUCH, THESE NOTES SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN-AS THE------ "GOLDEN RULE-----". YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO AS MANY ADVISORS, MED STUDENTS--------FELLOW APPLICANTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO GET THEIR INSIGHTS ON INTERVIEWING.---------------------------- "THERE IS WITHIN MEDICINE, SOMEWHERE BENEATH THE PESSIMISM AND DISCOURAGEMENT- RESULTING FROM THE DISARRAY OF THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM AND ITS STUPENDOUS COST, AN--UNDERCURRENT OF ALMOST OUTRAGEOUS OPTIMISM ABOUT WHAT MAY LIE AHEAD FOR THE TREATMENT- OF HUMAN-DISEASE IF WE CAN ONLY KEEP LEARNING.----------" - LEWIS THOMAS,---- THE MEDUSA AND THE SNAIL------------------------------------ "JUST WHAT IS THE MEDICAL SCHOOL INTERVIEW?----------------------------------" THE MEDICAL SCHOOL-INTERVIEW (MSI) BRINGS THE APPLICANT'S NUMBERS AND ESSAYS TO LIFE AND-, WITH ADEQUATE PREPARATION, CAN REALLY BOOST AN APPLICATION. THOUGH MCAT SCORES AND GPAS- ARE A MEDIOCRE INDEX OF HOW WELL A PERSON MIGHT DO IN MED SCHOOL AND DECIDES WHETHER AN- APPLICANT IS GRANTED AN MSI, THEY OFFER NOTHING TO ASSESS PERSONALITY OR SUITABILITY- FOR A CAREER IN MEDICINE. WITH DECREASING IMPORTANCE OF THE MCAT-AT MANY SCHOOLS AND A--STRONG DESIRE BY MEDICAL SCHOOLS TO TRAIN COMPASSIONATE PHYSICIANS, THE MSI-HAS A CENTRAL--ROLE IN ADMISSIONS. --------------------BEING SELECTED FOR A MSI IS-A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT IN ITSELF. THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS- ESSENTIALLY INVOLVES REDUCING A LARGE APPLICANT POOL TO A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF- COMPETITIVE APPLICANTS. THE MSI IS AN IMPERFECT MEANS OF SELECTING THE BEST POTENTIAL- MDS FROM AMONG THIS GROUP. BASICALLY, THE MSI IS DESIGNED TO SUBSTANTIATE YOUR APPLICATION- BY SUBJECTIVELY EVALUATING YOUR COMPATIBILITY WITH-THE SCHOOL AND MOTIVATIONS FOR PURSUING--AN MD. ALSO, TIME IS-ALLOWED FOR A QUESTION/ANSWER PERIOD ABOUT THE SCHOOL ITSELF.- THIS IS QUITE A DIFFICULT TASK IN AN INTERVIEW THAT LASTS ONLY 20 MINUTES------------------! "IS THERE ANY WAY TO PREPARE FOR THE 3RD DEGREE?----------------------------------" TIME SPENT IN PREPARATION FOR THE MSI IS TIME WELL-SPENT. THE ADMISSIONS PANEL WILL PLACE- A GREAT DEAL OF IMPORTANCE ON YOUR INTERVIEW REPORT, AND CONFIDENCE GOING INTO THE MSI- IS ESSENTIAL. YOU DON'T NEED TO SPEND HOURS PREPARING ANSWERS TO----- "STANDARD-----" MSI- QUESTIONS, BUT YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE MOST COMMONLY ASKED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS.-------------------- UNFORTUNATELY, MSI QUESTIONS CAN COME IN AN INFINITE NUMBER OF FORMS. THE SOLUTION:------ "STUDY-----" THE BASICS. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO STANDARD MSI QUESTIONS, CERTAIN- GENERAL TOPICS INVARIABLY COME UP: YOUR COLLEGE, WORK AND EXTRACURRICULAR EXPERIENCES;- YOUR MOTIVATION FOR BECOMING A PHYSICIAN; AND YOUR----- "UNIQUENESS-----". READ AND- RE-READ YOUR AMCAS PERSONAL STATEMENT AND OTHER ESSAYS. BE PREPARED TO TALK IN FURTHER- DETAIL ABOUT ANYTHING MENTIONED IN YOUR APPLICATION. GO BACK AND STUDY YOUR NOTES AND- ANY PUBLICATIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE FROM RESEARCH PROJECTS; RE-READ YOUR BEST HISTORY PAPER-, THE ARTICLE YOU WROTE FOR--- THE DAILY,---- ETC.--------------------- THINK BACK ON YOUR VARIOUS EXTRACURRICULAR- PURSUITS. WHAT DID THEY MEAN TO YOU AND HOW DID THEY INFLUENCE YOUR MOTIVATION TO BECOME- A PHYSICIAN? REALLY THINK ABOUT WHY YOU WANT TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL. WHAT DO YOU HOPE- TO ACCOMPLISH AND CONTRIBUTE TO MEDICINE? HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT BEING AN MD IS LIKE?- THINK ABOUT YOUR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, LIKES AND DISLIKES. IF YOU'RE A JUNIOR- RESEARCHER, WHY AREN'T YOU PURSUING JUST A PH.D.? WHERE IS YOUR RESEARCH GOING AND- WHAT WOULD YOU DO NEXT? BE AWARE OF ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN YOUR APPLICATION WHICH YOU- MAY WANT TO BRING UP AT THE MSI: ANY RECENT AWARDS OR ACHIEVEMENTS? YOU MIGHT MENTION- OTHER ACTIVITIES UNRELATED TO MEDICINE: CURRENT VOLUNTEER TUTORING, ATHLETIC PARTICIPATION-, A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE OR AN INTERESTING TRIP FOR SPRING BREAK IS WORTH DISCUSSING AND- COULD LIVEN A STALLED MSI.- THESE ARE JUST GUIDELINES TO----- "ORGANIZE-----" YOUR BRAIN;-- THE BEST PREPARATION IS TO KNOW YOURSELF AND TO HAVE SOLID REASONS FOR SEEKING AN MD.-------------------- THE ADMISSIONS PANEL WILL CERTAINLY WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU'RE APPLYING TO THEIR SCHOOL.- THEREFORE, RESEARCH THE SCHOOL THOROUGHLY BEFORE GOING FOR YOUR MSI. READ THE SCHOOL'S- CATALOG AND REVIEW THE STANFORD----- "RED BOOKS-----" (SURVEYS OF STANFORD GRADUATES- ATTENDING MED SCHOOLS). USE THIS INFORMATION WISELY DURING THE QUESTION/ANSWER PERIOD- OF YOUR MSI. CONSTRUCT INSIGHTFUL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL PROGRAM. WELL- THOUGHT-OUT QUESTIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU HAVE RESEARCHED THEIR PROGRAM AND ARE- ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE SCHOOL. DON'T ASK ABOUT THEIR GRADING SYSTEM OR VACATION SCHEDULE;- THIS IS BLATANTLY OBVIOUS IN THEIR CATALOG.--------- "WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EARLY- CLINICAL EXPERIENCES DURING MY FRESHMAN YEAR?----------" "IS IT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN TEACHING- EXPERIENCE DURING THE BASIC SCIENCES CURRICULUM?----------" ARE EXAMPLES OF APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS.-------------------- IN ADDITION, A GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF TRENDS IN MEDICINE AND THE GOINGS-ON IN THE WORLD MAKE- FOR INTERESTING CONVERSATION. TOPICS SUCH AS IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION, ABORTION, EUTHANASIA-, SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, THE AIDS EPIDEMIC AND THE HIGH COSTS OF MEDICINE ARE OFTEN BROUGHT UP- AS AN EXERCISE IN CURRENT AWARENESS AND LOGICAL THOUGHT. WHEN DISCUSSING SUCH TOPICS, SUBSTANTIATE- WHAT YOU BELIEVE WITH WHAT YOU KNOW. TRY NOT TO GET DEFENSIVE. THERE ARE NO RIGHT OR WRONG- ANSWERS. THINK ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES.-------------------- TAKE NOTES ON YOUR MSI----- "PERFORMANCES-----": WHAT WENT WELL, WHAT WENT WRONG?- THIS STRATEGY WILL HELP YOU IMPROVE SUBSEQUENT MSI PERFORMANCE. YOU SHOULD ALSO PLAN TO- RE-READ YOUR ENTIRE APPLICATION TO A SCHOOL THE NIGHT BEFORE YOUR MSI, JUST TO REFRESH- YOUR MEMORY. TO COME ACROSS WELL AT THE MSI, YOU NEED TO EXPRESS YOURSELF WELL: BE CONCISE- AND ARTICULATE. LEARNING TO RELAX WITH DIFFICULT QUESTIONS IS IMPORTANT IN HANDLING THE- STRESS OF AN MSI.-------------------- AS A FINAL PREPARATION BEFORE YOUR INTERVIEW, SCHEDULE A MOCK INTERVIEW AT THE UAC- - THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR---- IMMEDIATE----- FEEDBACK! ALL OF THIS PREPARATION WILL BUILD- YOUR CONFIDENCE AND HELP YOU TO PRESENT YOURSELF SUCCINCTLY---- REGARDLESS OF THE- QUESTIONS ASKED.----------------------- "WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME?----------------------------------" NIGHTMARES ABOUND REGARDING STRESSFUL INTERVIEWS AND YOU'VE LIKELY HEARD THE RUMORS.- FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND COMMON CONSENSUS, PRESSURE-TYPE INTERVIEWS ARE FAR LESS COMMON THAN- THE----- "LAID-BACK, CALIFORNIAN-----" VARIETY. GRANTED, THE MSI IS AN ANXIETY-RIDDEN- EXPERIENCE AND SOME FORM OF SELF-IMPOSED STRESS REACTION IS NORMAL. FORTUNATELY-, THE PROCESS GETS MUCH EASIER WITH EXPERIENCE AND, BY YOUR 3RD OR 4TH MSI, YOU MAY FIND- YOURSELF MORE RELAXED THAN-YOUR INTERVIEWER! REMEMBER THAT MOST INTERVIEWERS ARE- VOLUNTEERS FOR THE JOB AND AS SUCH: A--USUALLY ENJOY MEETING PEOPLE AND INTERVIEWING;- B) WERE ALL ONCE IN YOUR SHOES; AND C) DON'T BITE (USUALLY).-------------------- IN THE UNFORTUNATE EVENT THAT YOU RUN INTO SOMEONE WHO ASKS YOU TO OPEN A NAILED-SHUT- OFFICE WINDOW, KEEP YOUR COMPOSURE AND PLAY ALONG-WITH IT. IF DEALING WITH THE FORMER-, STICK WITH YOUR ANSWER AND SUBSTANTIATE IT. IF A QUESTION SEEMS VAGUE OR OFFENSIVE-, DON'T IMMEDIATELY JUMP IN WITHOUT THINKING. TRY TO CLARIFY WHAT'S BEING ASKED AND TO- PIN THE INTERVIEWER DOWN TO A SPECIFIC QUESTION. IF THIS DOESN'T WORK, PUNT:---------- "WELL, THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION. I'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT- THAT FOR A WHILE.------------------------------" INTERVIEW FORMATS VARY FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL. PRIOR TO YOUR INTERVIEW TRIP, TALK WITH- MEDICAL STUDENTS, YOUR ADVISORS AND FRIENDS WHO HAVE INTERVIEWED AT THE SCHOOL TO GET DETAILS.- ON THE AVERAGE, YOU WILL RECEIVE 2 ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS, OFTEN ONE WITH A FACULTY MEMBER- AND ONE WITH A MEDICAL STUDENT. OTHER VARIETIES DO EXIST WITH MULTIPLE INTERVIEWERS OR- MULTIPLE INTERVIEWEES. INTERVIEWS MAY BE----- "BLIND-----", WHERE THE INTERVIEWER HAS NOT- YET READ YOUR FILE, OR THEY MAY BE BASED ON A THOROUGH REVIEW. THERE ARE ADVANTAGES AND- DISADVANTAGES TO EACH. IN A BLIND INTERVIEW YOU MAY NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN YOUR- C- IN WEED OUT CHEMISTRY 101, BUT YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE TO TELL YOUR COMPLETE LIFE- STORY TO A STRANGER. IN A REVIEWED MSI, OFTEN THE INTERVIEWER HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR YOU- BASED ON COMMON ACADEMIC INTERESTS (A MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST FOR AN UNDERGRAD BIOCHEMISTRY- RESEARCHER, FOR EXAMPLE). THIS UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR COMPLETE HONESTY AND AVOIDANCE- OF EXAGGERATION. THE INTERVIEWER PROBABLY KNOWS MORE ABOUT YOUR SPECIALTY THAN YOU, AND- HALF TRUTHS REALLY STAND OUT.-------------------- ANOTHER POINT ABOUT MSIS IS THAT THEY OFTEN DON'T TAKE THE FULL SCHEDULED TIME ALLOTMENT- (GENERALLY 1 HOUR). MSIS CAN BE AS SHORT AS 20 MINUTES TO LONGER THAN 2 HOURS. NOTE:- THE LENGTH OF AN INTERVIEW IS NOT A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF HOW WELL OR HOW POORLY AN MSI WENT:- IT'S THE CONTENT THAT MATTERS.------------------ "WHO ARE THEY LOOKING FOR?----------------------------------" THE MSI IS DESIGNED TO FILL THE GAPS IN YOUR PERSONAL STATEMENT: ARE YOU CHARISMATIC-, ENTHUSIASTIC, FRIENDLY AND WARM? THE MSI ALSO SERVES TO ASSESS COMMUNICATION SKILLS:- DO YOU HAVE FLUID AND ARTICULATE SPEECH? MEDICAL SCHOOLS ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR PEOPLE- WHO ARE ORIENTED TO THE SCHOOL'S STRONG PROGRAMS: A RESEARCHER-TYPE MIGHT HAVE A TOUGHER- TIME GAINING ACCEPTANCE TO A SCHOOL THAT PRIMARILY TRAINS FAMILY PRACTITIONERS AND VICE VERSA.-------------------- INTERVIEWERS LIKE TO SEE AN APPLICANT WHO FOLLOWS WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD, NOT- SOMEONE BURIED COMPLETELY UNDER BOOKS. THEY WANT STUDENTS WITH A WELL-FOUNDED DESIRE TO- PRACTICE MEDICINE AND STUDENTS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT-THEIR SCHOOL. THEY WILL PROBE YOUR- INVOLVEMENT IN EXTRACURRICULAR-ACTIVITIES AND RESEARCH, AND EXPECT THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE.- YOU SHOULD STRESS THE---- INDEPENDENT WORK AND CREATIVITY----- THAT WENT INTO YOUR PROJECTS. WHAT- THOUGHT PROCESS, CRITICAL DECISIONS AND JUDGMENT WENT INTO YOUR EXPERIMENTATION? NO ONE- WANTS TO HEAR THE DETAILS OF HOW TO POUR AN AGAROSE GEL.-------------------- EXPRESS---- YOUR----- THOUGHTS, NOT WHAT YOU THINK THE INTERVIEWER WANTS TO HEAR.- ALSO REALIZE THAT YOUR INTERVIEWER WILL ASK YOU TWO BASIC TYPES OF QUESTIONS: THOSE THAT- YOU'RE EXPECTED TO KNOW AND THOSE THAT ARE GEARED TO TEST YOUR COMPREHENSION AND ANALYTICAL- ABILITIES. YOU AREN'T EXPECTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING, SO DON'T BE AFRAID TO SAY,----- "I- DON'T KNOW-----". IT'S OFTEN LOOKED UPON VERY FAVORABLY WHEN A STUDENT HAS THE COURAGE- TO ADMIT THIS. DON'T BLUFF OR GIVE A HAND-WAVING EXPLANATION THIS IS EASY TO SPOT. FINALLY-, YOU MAY BE ASKED HOW YOU RANK THEIR SCHOOL: BE HONEST. IF IT'S YOUR NUMBER ONE CHOICE-, BY ALL MEANS TELL THEM. IF NOT--STATE ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT YOU ARE STRONGLY CONSIDERING- THEM (OTHERWISE YOU'D BE WASTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY), BUT THAT YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED- VISITING/INTERVIEWING AT ALL SCHOOLS YET.------------------------ (ABOUT CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES: THESE CAN BE A PROBLEM FOR FEMALE APPLICANTS.- TOPICS LIKE PREGNANCY, RAISING CHILDREN, MARRIAGE, ETC. ARE TABOO, BUT MIGHT BE ASKED.- KEEP YOUR COOL AND ANSWER HONESTLY. UNFORTUNATELY, IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO THAT SCHOOL-, YOU'LL HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT PROTESTING. BUT, IF THE MSI WENT BADLY, YOU CAN DEFEND- YOURSELF IN A LETTER TO THE DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS STATING WHAT WAS UNFAIR. THIS TACTIC MIGHT- GO IN YOUR FAVOR AND YOU COULD GET ANOTHER MSI.)----------------------- "EMILY POST'S MSI ETIQUETTE----------------------------------" HONESTY, HUMILITY, ENTHUSIASM AND HUMOR (WITHIN REASON; PLAY IT BY EAR) ARE YOUR BEST- BETS FOR A SUCCESSFUL INTERVIEW.--------------------- REMEMBER NOT TO SELL YOURSELF SHORT - GO INTO THE MSI- BELIEVING YOU'RE A VERY SPECIAL PERSON WHO COULD----- "DO THEIR SCHOOL PROUD-----".- IF YOU DON'T TOOT YOUR HORN, NO ONE ELSE WILL. JUST DO IT IN MODERATION. YOU NEED TO WALK- THE FINE LINE BETWEEN HUMILITY AND CONCEIT TO GET YOUR BEST ATTRIBUTES ACROSS TO YOUR INTERVIEWER.- CONVERSELY, BE AWARE OF YOUR WEAK POINTS AS THESE MAY ALSO-COME UP IN THE DISCUSSION.- I REALIZE THAT STANFORD STUDENTS HAVE FEW WEAKNESSES, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE IDENTIFIED- A FEW BEFOREHAND. TYPICAL RESPONSES LIKE----- "I TEND TO GET INVOLVED IN TOO MANY ACTIVITIES-, BUT I NEVER LET MY PERFORMANCE BE COMPROMISED-----" ARE OVERUSED. YOU CAN DO BETTER - JUST ADD- A POSITIVE NOTE.--------------------- RELAX AND, IF POSSIBLE, ENJOY YOUR INTERVIEW. INTERVIEWERS ARE GENUINELY- INTERESTED IN MEETING AND MAKING NEXT YEAR'S CLASS A STRONG ONE, SO GENERALIZED TERROR- PROBABLY ISN'T WARRANTED. TRY TO EXPRESS A CONFIDENT AND POSITIVE ATTITUDE.--------------------- IF YOU ARE SHY, IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN THE ALLOTTED TIME TO GET THINGS ROLLING.--MONOSYLLABIC RESPONSES AND LACK OF ENTHUSIASM ARE NOT EXCITING CONVERSATION. THIS- PERCEPTION MAY CARRY OVER TO YOUR EVALUATION. PRACTICE MAKING STRONG FIRST IMPRESSIONS- WHEN MEETING PEOPLE. SCHEDULE A MOCK INTERVIEW AT UAC TO REINFORCE THIS. YOU NEED- TO COME ACROSS AS A WARM AND SENSITIVE PERSON WITH EXCELLENT POTENTIAL.-------------------- A WORD OF CAUTION: TRY NOT TO MONOPOLIZE THE INTERVIEW OR GET TOO VERBOSE. THIS LEAVES- A VERY NEGATIVE IMPRESSION. IF AN INTERVIEWER GETS ON A TANGENT AND YOU FEEL THAT YOU- HAVEN'T QUITE TOUCHED ON ALL THE MAJOR BASES IT'S OK TO TACTFULLY AND CAUTIOUSLY GUIDE- THE INTERVIEW IN A MORE PRODUCTIVE DIRECTION. AS FOR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, APPLICANTS- STICK OUT IN THEIR PRESSED BLUE BLAZERS AND CONSERVATIVE DRESSES AMONG THE FADED JEANS- AND UNSHAVEN FACES OF THE LOCAL MED STUDENTS (AND EVEN THEIR INTERVIEWERS ON OCCASION).- NONETHELESS, PROFESSIONAL AND CONSERVATIVE DRESS IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, AS IT IS A TOKEN- OF RESPECT AND REFLECTS A SERIOUS ATTITUDE. YOU MIGHT ARGUE THAT YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO------ "EXPRESS YOURSELF-----" THROUGH YOUR CLOTHING, BUT WHY RISK IT? YOU SHOULD DRESS- SO THAT THE INTERVIEWER WON'T THINK ABOUT YOUR ATTIRE BUT ABOUT YOU. THIS TRANSLATES- TO A 3-PIECE SUIT OR JACKET AND TIE FOR MEN, A BUSINESS-TYPE DRESS FOR WOMEN.-------------------- YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT YOUR BODY LANGUAGE AND HOW THIS MAY AFFECT YOUR INTERVIEWER.- SPECIFICALLY, TRY NOT TO FIDGET OR TAP YOUR FEET. NERVOUSNESS IS NORMAL; TRY TO QUELL- THIS WITH AN OCCASIONAL DEEP BREATH. DON'T STARE OUTSIDE OR AT THE CLOCK. EXPRESS INTEREST- IN WHAT BOTH OF YOU ARE SAYING BY LEANING SLIGHTLY FORWARD AND KEEPING EYE CONTACT WITH YOUR- INTERVIEWER.-------------------- ONE LAST WORD OF ADVICE ON MSI ETIQUETTE: DON'T TAKE THE MEDICAL STUDENT INTERVIEW TOO- LIGHTLY. THEIR REPORTS CARRY JUST AS MUCH CLOUT AS A FACULTY MSI. THEREFORE, DON'T BE- COCKY OR CONFIDE SOMETHING TO A STUDENT THAT YOU WOULD NEVER SAY TO A PROFESSOR. REMEMBER- THAT STUDENT AND FACULTY ARE WORKING TOGETHER AND YOU MIGHT GET BURNED.------------------ "FUN FACTS TO KNOW---- & TELL ABOUT MSI SCHEDULING----------------------------------- MSI'S ARE USUALLY BY---- INVITATION ONLY-----. THE ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE REVIEWS YOUR GPA, MCAT SCORES-, PERSONAL STATEMENT, SECONDARY APPLICATION AND LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION, AND THEN SOMEHOW- DECIDES WHOM TO INTERVIEW (SEE RUBY AND NANCY ON HOW TO GO ABOUT GETTING ONE). THE- PERCENTAGE OF APPLICANTS INTERVIEWED DEPENDS ON THE PARTICULAR SCHOOL - OFTEN ONLY A SMALL- FRACTION ARE GRANTED AN-MSI. ONCE YOU'VE BEEN GRANTED AN-INTERVIEW, PAT YOURSELF ON THE- BACK AND/OR CONGRATULATE YOURSELF IN SOME FASHION. YOU'VE MADE THE BIG CUT AND ARE ONE OF A- FEW HIGHLY COMPETITIVE APPLICANTS BEING CONSIDERED. OFTEN-A SCHOOL WILL ASSIGN-YOU A- DATE AND TIME THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ACCOMMODATE, ESPECIALLY IF ON THE EAST COAST.- GENERALLY, THE ADMISSIONS STAFF IS FLEXIBLE AND WILL ARRANGE ANOTHER DATE AS NEED BE.-------------------- IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM A SCHOOL BUT WILL BE----- "IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD-----" ON THE- OPPOSITE COAST, IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO CALL OR WRITE A SCHOOL WELL IN ADVANCE OF YOUR TRIP- TO REQUEST AN MSI. GIVE THE SCHOOL AT LEAST 3-4 WEEKS LEEWAY, THE DATES OF YOUR TRIP AND- A POLITE LETTER. IT'S OK TO CALL IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN A RESPONSE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. IT- ISN'T OK, HOWEVER, TO WALK UP TO THEIR DOORSTEP AND REQUEST AN INTERVIEW ON THE SPOT.-------------------- THIS IS A SERIOUS MSI---- FAUX PAS.----- IF YOU HAVE BEEN REJECTED FROM A SCHOOL BUT- THINK YOUR APPLICATION IS COMPETITIVE (BE REALISTIC), YOU MAY APPEAL THE DECISION AND- ASK FOR A REVIEW OF YOUR RECORD. AFTER ALL, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AND AT BEST WILL- GET AN INTERVIEW.-------------------- SOME SCHOOLS WILL OFFER A REGIONAL MSI; THERE IS NO KNOWN DISADVANTAGE WITH RESPECT TO- ADMISSION BY OPTING FOR A REGIONAL. SOME SAY THAT HAVING A LOCAL MSI MAY SHOW A GREATER- INTEREST IN A SCHOOL, BUT COMMITTEES ARE COGNIZANT OF FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS. IF ACCEPTED- AND/OR HIGHLY CONSIDERING A SCHOOL, CHECK IT OUT---- FIRST BEFORE----- ACCEPTING A SPOT THERE.-------------------- YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING,----- "HOW CAN I AFFORD A DELUXE MSI VACATION?-----" TICKETING AS- FAR IN ADVANCE AS POSSIBLE HELPS LOWER TRAVEL COSTS. TRY TO GROUP SCHOOLS REGIONALLY- TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY; IF YOU'VE ARRANGED A GROUP OF 2 OR MORE EAST COAST SCHOOLS-, YOU CAN GET SPECIAL FARES WITH UNLIMITED TRAVEL FOR 21 DAYS (TRY CONTINENTAL AND AMERICAN).- THIS OFTEN TAKES SEVERAL PHONE CALLS BACK AND FORTH TO THE ADMISSIONS OFFICES TO JUGGLE- INTERVIEW DATES. 5-STAR ACCOMMODATIONS CAN OFTEN BE ARRANGED WITH A LOCAL MEDICAL STUDENT- OR IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOL DORMITORY FOR A REASONABLE PRICE (THIS IS ALSO A GREAT WAY TO MEET- THE----- "LOCALS-----"); CALL THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE FOR DETAILS.-------------------- ONE FINAL-THOUGHT: THE INTERVIEWING----- "SEASON-----" OFTEN EXTENDS UNTIL MAY. GENERALLY-, THE EARLIER YOU COMPLETE YOUR AMCAS AND SECONDARY APPLICATIONS, THE EARLIER YOUR FILE IS- REVIEWED FOR INTERVIEW. LATER IN THE SEASON, THE OFFICES BECOME BACKLOGGED AND-YOU MAY- HAVE TO WAIT IN LIMBO LONGER. APPLY EARLY------------------! "WHAT DO I GET IN RETURN?----------------------------------" YOU MAY RECEIVE SOME FEEDBACK WITH RESPECT TO YOUR CHANCES FOR ACCEPTANCE. DON'T READ TOO- DEEPLY INTO YOUR INTERVIEWER'S COMMENTS OR THE ATMOSPHERE OF YOUR DISCUSSION, HOWEVER. REMEMBER- THAT THE COMMENT,----- "I HOPE TO SEE YOU HERE NEXT YEAR-----" IS ONLY COMING FROM ONE MEMBER- OF THE ADMISSIONS PANEL. CONVERSELY, A PERCEIVED----- "BAD-----" INTERVIEW MAY REFLECT THE- INTERVIEWER'S PERSONALITY, AND S/HE MAY HAVE BEEN EXPRESSIONLESSLY BUT THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED- BY YOU. MOREOVER, ONE MARGINAL MSI MAY BE ENTIRELY NEGATED BY ANOTHER EXCELLENT ONE.- MY ADVICE: THINK POSITIVE AND CROSS YOUR FINGERS.-------------------- YOU WILL DEFINITELY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCOVER LOTS OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHOOL- AND ITS ENVIRONS (ELICITED BY-YOUR INSIGHTFUL QUESTIONS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, REMEMBER?).--TAKE A TOUR OR, IF YOUR MSI-IS REGIONAL, PLAN ON-SEEING-THE SCHOOL WELL BEFORE ENROLLING.- TALK TO AS MANY STUDENTS AS POSSIBLE AND-INQUIRE ABOUT THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LECTURES- AND CLINICAL EDUCATION. DO SENIOR MEDICAL STUDENTS THINK THEY RECEIVED A QUALITY EDUCATION?- ALSO, TRY TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE, THE CLIMATE, YOUR PROSPECTIVE PEERS AND THE- CULTURAL/RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES AVAILABLE.- THINK ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AND FRIEND- SUPPORT NETWORK - HOW WOULD IT CHANGE? IS THIS IMPORTANT? HOW WOULD YOU, INDIVIDUALLY-, FIT INTO THE MEDICAL SCHOOL?-------------------- THIS WILL BE THE TIME TO GET INFO ON FINANCIAL AID, STUDENT HOUSING, NAT'L. BOARD SCORES- AND THE NAT'L. RESIDENCY MATCHING PROGRAM. VISIT THE FINANCIAL AID AND HOUSING OFFICES-, TIME PERMITTING. APPLICANTS TEND TO FOCUS ON BOARD SCORES AND THE PERCENTAGE OF SCHOOL'S- SENIORS MATCHING THEIR TOP CHOICE FOR RESIDENCY TRAINING. A FEW WORDS OF CAUTION ON EACH:- SOME LESSER SCHOOLS GEAR THEIR TEACHING TOWARD PERFORMANCE ON THE NAT'L. BOARDS (RATHER- THAN THE ART OF MEDICINE). AS SUCH, THEIR STUDENTS SCORE MUCH HIGHER THAN NORMAL.- REMEMBER THAT YOUR PATIENTS WON'T HAVE A 3 X 5 INDEX CARD ON THEIR FOREHEAD WITH LABELED- OPTIONS. AS FOR CLAIMS LIKE:----- "90% OF OUR GRADUATING CLASS MATCHED THEIR TOP- 3 CHOICES-----", REGARD SUCH STATEMENTS WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SKEPTICISM AS WELL.- THE RESIDENCY MATCHING PROGRAM WORKS WITH A SELF-SELECTED APPLICANT POOL: A C+ STUDENT- FROM GRANADA MEDICAL SCHOOL WON'T APPLY FOR TRAINING IN NEUROSURGERY AT MASSACHUSETTS- GENERAL HOSPITAL.------------------ "WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?-----" I.E.---- THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE---------------------------------- SOMEHOW ALL OF THE INFORMATION AT THE COMMITTEE'S DISPOSAL GOES INTO A BLACK BOX - THE- COMMITTEE MEETING - AND EMERGES AS ACCEPTED, WAIT LIST AND REJECTED CANDIDATES. OFTEN- THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE SEEM ARBITRARY AND NONSENSICAL. I COULDN'T EVEN ATTEMPT- TO DESCRIBE OR UNRAVEL THE MYSTERIES OF THE PANEL AS THEY VARY FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL AND- YEAR TO YEAR. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT A STRONG INTERVIEW CAN REALLY BOOST EVEN A MARGINAL- APPLICANT TO AN ACCEPTED SPOT. GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.-------------------- A SINCERE FOLLOW-UP THANK YOU NOTE TO AN INTERVIEWER IS FINE IF YOU REALLY ENJOYED- THE CONVERSATION AND IF YOU HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN THEIR SCHOOL. DON'T WRITE IF THE- MSI WAS ONLY MARGINAL, AS THIS MAY APPEAR LIKE BEGGING. SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR THE- COMMITTEE'S DECISION.------------- SUMMARY: THE GOLDEN RULES OF INTERVIEWING------------------------ I.--- PREPARE YOURSELF-------- - KNOW YOURSELF-------- - KNOW THE SCHOOL; HAVE QUESTIONS READY-------- - KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD AND IN MEDICINE II.----- BE YOURSELF-------- - BE HONEST-------- - DON'T BE AFRAID TO SAY:----- "I DON'T KNOW------" III.--- BE CLEAR AND CONCISEIV.--- BE ENTHUSIASTIC AND CONFIDENT V.--- DON'T MONOPOLIZE THE CONVERSATIONVI.--- BE PROMPT AND DRESS APPROPRIATELYII.--- DON'T BE PUSHY ABOUT SCHEDULINGII.--- TAKE A TOURIX.--- TRY TO RELAX X.--- DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT YOUR AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD------------------- A DISCLAIMER----------------------------- THE ABOVE NOTES REPRESENT THE UNEDITED THOUGHTS OF ONE SCOTT EDWARD PARAZYNSKI AND, AS SUCH-, SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED OFFICIAL UNDERGRADUATE ADVISING CENTER RECOMMENDATIONS.
