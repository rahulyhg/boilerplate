-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPAN-UNITED STATES RELATIONS WERE MORE-UNCERTAIN IN THE EARLY 1990S-------- THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE WORLD WAR II. AS LONG-STANDING MILITARY ALLIES-------- AND INCREASINGLY INTERDEPENDENT ECONOMIC PARTNERS, JAPAN AND THE UNITED-------- STATES COOPERATED CLOSELY TO-BUILD A STRONG, MULTIFACETED RELATIONSHIP-------- BASED ON DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND INTERESTS IN-WORLD STABILITY AND --------DEVELOPMENT. JAPAN-UNITED STATES RELATIONS IMPROVED ENORMOUSLY IN THE-------- 1970S AND 1980S, AS THE TWO SOCIETIES AND ECONOMIES BECAME INCREASINGLY-------- INTERTWINED. IN 1990 THEIR COMBINED GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT (GNP) TOTALED ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE WORLD'S GNP. JAPAN RECEIVED-------- ABOUT 11 PERCENT OF UNITED STATES EXPORTS (A LARGER SHARE THAN ANY OTHER-------- COUNTRY EXCEPT CANADA), AND THE UNITED STATES BOUGHT ABOUT 34 PERCENT OF-------- JAPAN'S EXPORTS. JAPAN HAD US$148 BILLION IN DIRECT-------- INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES IN 1991, WHILE THE UNITED STATES HAD-------- MORE THAN US$17 BILLION INVESTED IN JAPAN. SOME US$100 BILLION IN UNITED-------- STATES GOVERNMENT SECURITIES-HELD BY INSTITUTIONS IN JAPAN HELPED-------- FINANCE MUCH OF THE UNITED STATES BUDGET DEFICIT. ECONOMIC EXCHANGES-------- WERE REINFORCED BY A VARIETY OF SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL, TOURIST, AND-------- OTHER EXCHANGES. EACH SOCIETY CONTINUED TO SEE THE OTHER AS ITS MAIN-------- ALLY IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC. CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LATE 1980S-------- DAMAGED BILATERAL-RELATIONS. NEVERTHELESS, PUBLIC OPINION SURVEYS-------- CONTINUED TO REVEAL THAT SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITIES OF JAPANESE AND-------- AMERICANS BELIEVED THAT THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WAS VITAL TO BOTH-------- COUNTRIES.----------- GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MARKEDLY CHANGING-------- CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME AND ABROAD THAT WERE WIDELY SEEN TO HAVE CREATED A-------- CRISIS IN JAPAN-UNITED STATES RELATIONS IN THE LATE 1980S. UNITED STATES-------- GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CONTINUED TO EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THE-------- RELATIONSHIP BUT WARNED THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR----- "A NEW CONCEPTUAL-------- FRAMEWORK.-----" THE---- WALL STREET JOURNAL----- PUBLICIZED A SERIES OF-------- LENGTHY REPORTS DOCUMENTING CHANGES IN THE RELATIONSHIP IN THE-LATE-------- 1980S AND REVIEWING THE CONSIDERABLE DEBATE IN JAPAN AND THE UNITED-------- STATES OVER WHETHER A CLOSELY COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP WAS POSSIBLE OR-------- APPROPRIATE FOR THE 1990S. AN AUTHORITATIVE REVIEW OF POPULAR AND MEDIA-------- OPINION, PUBLISHED IN 1990 BY THE WASHINGTON-BASED COMMISSION ON-------- US-JAPAN RELATIONS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, WAS CONCERNED WITH-------- PRESERVING A CLOSE JAPAN-UNITED STATES RELATIONSHIP. IT WARNED OF A------------- "NEW ORTHODOXY-----" OF----- "SUSPICION, CRITICISM AND CONSIDERABLE-------- SELF- JUSTIFICATION,-----" WHICH IT SAID WAS ENDANGERING THE FABRIC OF-------- JAPAN- UNITED STATES RELATIONS.----------- THREE SETS OF FACTORS STAND OUT AS THE MOST IMPORTANT IN EXPLAINING-------- THE CHALLENGES FACING JAPAN-UNITED STATES RELATIONS. THEY ARE ECONOMIC--------, POLITICAL-MILITARY, AND DOMESTIC IN NATURE.----------- THE RELATIVE ECONOMIC POWER OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES WAS-------- UNDERGOING SWEEPING CHANGE, ESPECIALLY IN THE 1980S. THIS CHANGE WENT-------- WELL BEYOND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE DEFICIT WITH-------- JAPAN, WHICH HAD REMAINED BETWEEN US$40 BILLION AND US$48 BILLION-------- ANNUALLY SINCE THE MID-1980S. THE PERSISTING UNITED STATES TRADE AND-------- BUDGET DEFICITS OF THE EARLY 1980S LED TO A SERIES OF DECISIONS IN THE-------- MIDDLE OF THE DECADE THAT BROUGHT A MAJOR REALIGNMENT OF THE VALUE OF-------- JAPANESE AND UNITED S----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TATES GOVERNMENTS TO-REASSESS THEIR LONGSTANDING ALLIANCE AGAINST THE-------- SOVIET THREAT. OFFICIALS OF BOTH NATIONS HAD TENDED TO CHARACTERIZE THE-------- SECURITY-ALLIANCE AS THE LINCHPIN OF THE RELATIONSHIP, WHICH SHOULD HAVE-------- PRIORITY OVER ECONOMIC AND OTHER DISPUTES. SOME JAPANESE AND UNITED---------STATES OFFICIALS AND-COMMENTATORS CONTINUED TO EMPHASIZE THE COMMON-------- DANGERS TO JAPAN- UNITED STATES INTERESTS POSED BY THE CONTINUED STRONG-------- SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE IN ASIA. THEY STRESSED THAT UNTIL MOSCOW FOLLOWED --------ITS MODERATION IN EUROPE WITH MAJOR DEMOBILIZATION AND REDUCTIONS IN ITS-------- FORCES POSITIONED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN IN THE PACIFIC--------, WASHINGTON AND TOKYO NEEDED TO REMAIN MILITARILY PREPARED AND VIGILANT.----------- INCREASINGLY, HOWEVER, OTHER PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF CLOSE JAPAN--------- UNITED STATES SECURITY TIES WERE EMPHASIZED. THE ALLIANCE WAS SEEN AS-------- DETERRING OTHER POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE FORCES IN EAST ASIA, NOTABLY THE-------- DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA (NORTH KOREA). IRONICALLY, SOME-------- UNITED STATES OFFICIALS NOTED THAT THE ALLIANCE HELPED KEEP JAPAN'S-------- POTENTIAL MILITARY POWER IN CHECK AND UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE-------- UNITED STATES.----------- THE POST-COLD WAR ENVIRONMENT STRENGTHENED THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF-------- ECONOMIC PROWESS OVER MILITARY POWER AS THE MAJOR SOURCE OF WORLD-------- INFLUENCE IN THE EARLY 1990S. THIS SHIFT AFFECTED THE PERCEIVED RELATIVE-------- STANDING OF JAPAN, THE UNITED STATES, AND OTHER POWERS. INCREASINGLY--------, JAPAN WAS EXPECTED TO SHOULDER INTERNATIONAL AID AND ECONOMIC-------- RESPONSIBILITIES THAT IN THE PAST WERE DISCHARGED BY THE UNITED STATES-------- AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES.----------- THE DECLINING SOVIET THREAT, THE RISING POWER OF THE JAPANESE-------- ECONOMY, INCREASINGLY CLOSE UNITED STATES INTERACTION (AND RELATED-------- DISPUTES) WITH JAPAN, AND OTHER FACTORS LED BY 1990 TO A DECIDED SHIFT-------- IN UNITED STATES OPINION ABOUT JAPAN AND TO LESS MARKED BUT NONETHELESS-------- NOTABLE SHIFTS IN JAPANESE OPINION. IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS SHIFT WAS-------- REFLECTED IN QUESTIONS ABOUT WHICH WAS THE MORE SERIOUS, THE MILITARY-------- THREAT FROM THE SOVIET UNION OR THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGE FROM JAPAN. IN A-------- SERIES OF POLLS IN 1989 AND 1990, MOST RESPONDENTS CONSIDERED THE-------- CHALLENGE FROM JAPAN THE MORE SERIOUS. SIMILARLY, POLL DATA FROM EARLY-------- 1990 SHOWED THAT MOST JAPANESE CONSIDERED NEGATIVE UNITED STATES-------- ATTITUDES TOWARD JAPAN A REFLECTION OF UNITED STATES ANGER AT------------- "AMERICA'S SLIPPING ECONOMIC POSITION.-----" MEANWHILE, JAPANESE-------- OPINION WAS SHOWING GREATER CONFIDENCE IN JAPAN'S ABILITY TO HANDLE ITS-------- OWN AFFAIRS WITHOUT CONSTANT REFERENCE--AS IN THE PAST--TO THE UNITED-------- STATES. JAPAN'S BELIEF IN UNITED STATES RELIABILITY AS A WORLD LEADER-------- ALSO LESSENED.----------- IN BOTH COUNTRIES, NEW OR----- "REVISIONIST-----" VIEWS OF THE JAPAN--------- UNITED STATES RELATIONSHIP WERE PROMOTED. IN JAPAN SOME COMMENTATORS-------- ARGUED THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS WEAK, DEPENDENT ON JAPAN, AND UNABLE-------- TO COME TO TERMS WITH WORLD ECONOMIC COMPETITION. THEY URGED JAPAN TO-------- STRIKE OUT ON A MORE INDEPENDENT COURSE. IN THE UNITED STATES, PROMINENT-------- COMMENTATORS WARNED OF A JAPANESE ECONOMIC JUGGERNAUT, OUT OF CONTROL OF-------- THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT, WHICH NEEDED TO BE----- "CONTAINED-----" BY THE-------- UNITED STATES.----------- AT THE SAME TIME, IT WAS EASY TO OVERSTATE THE CHANGES IN OPINION IN-------- BOTH COUNTRIES. THE JAPANESE STILL CONSIDERED THE UNITED STATES-------- POSITIVELY AS THEIR CLOSEST FRIEND, THE PRINCIPAL GUARDIAN OF THEIR-------- EXTERNAL SECURITY, THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC PARTNER AND MARKET, AND-------- THE EXEMPLAR OF A LIFE-STYLE THAT HAD MUCH TO OFFER--AND MUCH TO ENVY.-------- MOREOVER, THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS STILL VIEWED JAPAN POSITIVELY--------, HAD HIGH RESPECT FOR JAPANESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND SUPPORTED THE UNITED-------- STATES DEFENSE COMMITMENT TO JAPAN.----------- IN THE YEARS AFTER WORLD WAR II, JAPAN'S RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED-------- STATES WERE PLACED ON AN EQUAL FOOTING FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE END OF-------- THE OCCUPATION BY THE ALLIED FORCES IN APRIL------ THIS EQUALITY, THE-------- LEGAL BASIS OF WHICH WAS LAID DOWN IN THE PEACE TREATY SIGNED BY-------- FORTY-EIGHT ALLIED NATIONS AND JAPAN, WAS INITIALLY LARGELY NOMINAL--------, BECAUSE IN THE EARLY POSTOCCUPATION PERIOD JAPAN REQUIRED DIRECT UNITED-------- STATES ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE. A FAVORABLE JAPANESE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS-------- WITH THE UNITED STATES WAS ACHIEVED IN 1954, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF-------- UNITED STATES MILITARY AND AID SPENDING IN JAPAN.----------- THE JAPANESE PEOPLE'S FEELING OF DEPENDENCE LESSENED GRADUALLY AS THE-------- DISASTROUS RESULTS OF WORLD WAR II SUBSIDED INTO THE BACKGROUND AND-------- TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES EXPANDED. SELF-CONFIDENCE GREW AS THE-------- COUNTRY APPLIED ITS RESOURCES AND ORGANIZATIONAL SKILL TO REGAINING-------- ECONOMIC HEALTH. THIS SITUATION GAVE RISE TO A GENERAL DESIRE FOR-------- GREATER INDEPENDENCE FROM UNITED STATES INFLUENCE. DURING THE 1950S AND-------- 1960S, THIS FEELING WAS ESPECIALLY EVIDENT IN THE JAPANESE ATTITUDE-------- TOWARD UNITED STATES MILITARY BASES ON THE FOUR MAIN ISLANDS OF JAPAN-------- AND IN OKINAWA PREFECTURE, OCCUPYING THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE-------- RYUKYU ISLANDS.----------- THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO BALANCE LEFT-WING PRESSURE ADVOCATING-------- DISSOCIATION FROM THE UNITED STATES AGAINST THE REALITIES OF THE NEED-------- FOR MILITARY PROTECTION. RECOGNIZING THE POPULAR DESIRE FOR THE RETURN-------- OF THE RYUKYU ISLANDS AND THE BONIN ISLANDS (ALSO KNOWN AS THE OGASAWARA-------- ISLANDS), THE UNITED STATES AS EARLY AS 1953 VOLUNTARILY RELINQUISHED-------- ITS CONTROL OF THE AMAMI GROUP OF ISLANDS AT THE NORTHERN END OF THE-------- RYUKYU ISLANDS. BUT THE UNITED STATES MADE NO COMMITMENT TO RETURN-------- OKINAWA, WHICH WAS THEN UNDER UNITED STATES MILITARY ADMINISTRATION FOR-------- AN INDEFINITE PERIOD AS PROVIDED IN ARTICLE 3 OF THE PEACE TREATY.-------- POPULAR AGITATION CULMINATED IN A UNANIMOUS RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE-------- DIET IN JUNE 1956, CALLING FOR A RETURN OF OKINAWA TO JAPAN.----------- BILATERAL TALKS ON REVISING THE 1952 SECURITY PACT BEGAN IN 1959, AND-------- THE NEW TREATY OF MUTUAL COOPERATION AND SECURITY WAS SIGNED IN-------- WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 19,------ WHEN THE PACT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE DIET-------- FOR RATIFICATION ON FEBRUARY 5, IT BECAME THE SUBJECT OF BITTER DEBATE-------- OVER THE JAPAN-UNITED STATES RELATIONSHIP AND THE OCCASION FOR VIOLENCE-------- IN AN ALL-OUT EFFORT BY THE LEFTIST OPPOSITION TO PREVENT ITS PASSAGE.-------- IT WAS FINALLY APPROVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON MAY---- JAPAN-------- SOCIALIST PARTY DEPUTIES BOYCOTTED THE LOWER HOUSE SESSION AND TRIED TO-------- PREVENT THE LDP DEPUTIES FROM ENTERING THE CHAMBER; THEY WERE FORCIBLY-------- REMOVED BY THE POLICE. MASSIVE DEMONSTRATIONS AND RIOTING BY STUDENTS-------- AND TRADE UNIONS FOLLOWED. THESE OUTBURSTS PREVENTED A SCHEDULED VISIT-------- TO JAPAN BY PRESIDENT DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER AND PRECIPITATED THE-------- RESIGNATION OF PRIME MINISTER KISHI NOBUSUKE, BUT NOT BEFORE THE TREATY-------- WAS PASSED BY DEFAULT ON JUNE 19, WHEN THE HOUSE OF COUNCILLORS FAILED-------- TO VOTE ON THE ISSUE WITHIN THE REQUIRED THIRTY DAYS AFTER LOWER HOUSE-------- APPROVAL.----------- UNDER THE TREATY, BOTH PARTIES ASSUMED AN OBLIGATION TO ASSIST EACH-------- OTHER IN CASE OF ARMED ATTACK ON TERRITORIES UNDER JAPANESE-------- ADMINISTRATION. (IT WAS UNDERSTOOD, HOWEVER, THAT JAPAN COULD NOT COME-------- TO THE DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE IT WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY-------- FORBIDDEN TO SEND ARMED FORCES OVERSEAS. IN PARTICULAR, THE CONSTITUTION-------- FORBIDS THE MAINTENANCE OF----- "LAND, SEA, AND AIR FORCES.-----" IT-------- ALSO EXPRESSES THE JAPANESE PEOPLE'S RENUNCIATION OF----- "THE THREAT OR-------- USE OF FORCE AS A MEANS OF SETTLING INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES-----".-------- ACCORDINGLY, THE JAPANESE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEND THEIR------------- "SELF-DEFENSE-----" FORCES OVERSEAS, EVEN FOR PEACE-KEEPING-------- PURPOSES.) THE SCOPE OF THE NEW TREATY DID NOT EXTEND TO THE RYUKYU-------- ISLANDS, BUT AN APPENDED MINUTE MADE CLEAR THAT IN CASE OF AN ARMED-------- ATTACK ON THE ISLANDS, BOTH GOVERNMENTS WOULD CONSULT AND TAKE-------- APPROPRIATE ACTION. NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE TREATY PROVIDED FOR PRIOR-------- CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS BEFORE ANY MAJOR CHANGE-------- OCCURRED IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES TROOPS OR EQUIPMENT IN-------- JAPAN. UNLIKE THE 1952 SECURITY PACT, THE NEW TREATY PROVIDED FOR A-------- TEN-YEAR TERM, AFTER WHICH IT COULD BE REVOKED UPON ONE YEAR'S NOTICE BY-------- EITHER PARTY. THE TREATY INCLUDED GENERAL PROVISIONS ON THE FURTHER-------- DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND ON IMPROVED FUTURE ECONOMIC-------- COOPERATION.----------- BOTH COUNTRIES WORKED CLOSELY TO FULFILL THE UNITED STATES PROMISE--------, UNDER ARTICLE 3 OF THE PEACE TREATY, TO RETURN ALL JAPANESE TERRITORIES-------- ACQUIRED BY THE UNITED STATES IN WAR. IN JUNE 1968 THE UNITED STATES-------- RETURNED THE BONIN ISLANDS (INCLUDING IWO JIMA) TO JAPANESE-------- ADMINISTRATION CONTROL. IN 1969 THE OKINAWA REVERSION ISSUE AND JAPAN'S-------- SECURITY TIES WITH THE UNITED STATES BECAME THE FOCAL POINTS OF PARTISAN-------- POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS. THE SITUATION CALMED CONSIDERABLY WHEN PRIME-------- MINISTER SATO EISAKU VISITED WASHINGTON IN NOVEMBER 1969, AND IN A JOINT-------- COMMUNIQU  SIGNED BY HIM AND PRESIDENT RICHARD M. NIXON, ANNOUNCED THE-------- UNITED STATES AGREEMENT TO RETURN OKINAWA TO JAPAN IN------ IN JUNE-------- 1971, AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS, THE TWO COUNTRIES SIGNED AN-------- AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR THE RETURN OF OKINAWA TO JAPAN IN----------------- THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT'S FIRM AND VOLUNTARY ENDORSEMENT OF THE-------- SECURITY TREATY AND THE SETTLEMENT OF THE OKINAWA REVERSION QUESTION-------- MEANT THAT, TWO MAJOR POLITICAL ISSUES IN JAPAN-UNITED STATES RELATIONS-------- WERE ELIMINATED. BUT NEW ISSUES AROSE. IN JULY 1971, THE JAPANESE-------- GOVERNMENT WAS SURPRISED BY NIXON'S DRAMATIC-ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS --------FORTHCOMING-VISIT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. MANY JAPANESE WERE-------- CHAGRINED BY THE FAILURE OF THE UNITED STATES TO CONSULT IN ADVANCE WITH-------- JAPAN BEFORE MAKING SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN FOREIGN POLICY. THE-------- FOLLOWING MONTH, THE GOVERNMENT WAS AGAIN SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT--------, WITHOUT PRIOR CONSULTATION, THE UNITED STATES HAD IMPOSED A 10 PERCENT-------- SURCHARGE ON IMPORTS, A DECISION CERTAIN TO HINDER JAPAN'S EXPORTS TO-------- THE UNITED STATES. RELATIONS BETWEEN TOKYO AND WASHINGTON WERE FURTHER-------- STRAINED BY THE MONETARY CRISIS INVOLVING THE DECEMBER 1971 REVALUATION-------- OF THE JAPANESE YEN.----------- THESE EVENTS OF 1971 MARKED THE BEGINNING OF A NEW STAGE IN-------- RELATIONS, A PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT TO A CHANGING WORLD SITUATION THAT WAS-------- NOT WITHOUT EPISODES OF STRAIN IN BOTH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SPHERES--------, ALTHOUGH-THE BASIC RELATIONSHIP REMAINED CLOSE. THE POLITICAL ISSUES-------- BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WERE ESSENTIALLY SECURITY-RELATED AND DERIVED-------- FROM EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES TO INDUCE JAPAN TO CONTRIBUTE MORE TO-------- ITS OWN DEFENSE AND TO REGIONAL SECURITY. THE ECONOMIC ISSUES TENDED TO---------STEM FROM THE EVER-WIDENING UNITED STATES TRADE AND PAYMENTS DEFICITS-------- WITH JAPAN, WHICH BEGAN IN 1965 WHEN JAPAN REVERSED ITS IMBALANCE IN-------- TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES AND, FOR THE FIRST TIME, ACHIEVED AN EXPORT-------- SURPLUS.----------- THE UNITED STATES WITHDRAWAL FROM INDOCHINA IN 1975 AND THE END OF-------- THE SECOND INDOCHINA WAR MEANT THAT THE QUESTION OF JAPAN'S ROLE IN THE-------- SECURITY OF EAST ASIA AND ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS OWN DEFENSE BECAME-------- CENTRAL TOPICS IN THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. UNITED STATES-------- DISSATISFACTION WITH JAPANESE DEFENSE EFFORTS BEGAN TO SURFACE IN-------- 1975 WHEN SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JAMES A. SCHLESINGER PUBLICLY STIGMATIZED-------- JAPAN AS A PASSIVE DEFENSE PARTNER.----------- UNITED STATES PRESSURES CONTINUED AND INTENSIFIED, PARTICULARLY AS-------- EVENTS IN IRAN AND ELSEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER 1979-CAUSED THE-------- UNITED STATES TO RELOCATE MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF ITS NAVAL STRENGTH-------- FROM EAST ASIAN WATERS TO THE INDIAN OCEAN. JAPAN WAS REPEATEDLY PRESSED-------- NOT ONLY TO INCREASE ITS DEFENSE EXPENDITURES AND BUILD UP ITS-------- ANTISUBMARINE AND NAVAL PATROL CAPABILITIES BUT ALSO TO PLAY A MORE-------- ACTIVE AND POSITIVE SECURITY ROLE GENERALLY.----------- THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT, CONSTRAINED BY CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS-------- AND STRONGLY PACIFIST PUBLIC OPINION, RESPONDED SLOWLY TO PRESSURES FOR-------- A MORE RAPID BUILDUP OF ITS SELF-DEFENSE FORCES (SDF). IT STEADILY-------- INCREASED ITS BUDGETARY OUTLAYS FOR THOSE FORCES, HOWEVER, AND INDICATED-------- ITS WILLINGNESS TO SHOULDER MORE OF THE COST OF MAINTAINING THE UNITED-------- STATES MILITARY BASES IN JAPAN. IN 1976 THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN-------- FORMALLY ESTABLISHED A SUBCOMMITTEE FOR DEFENSE COOPERATION, IN THE-------- FRAMEWORK OF A BILATERAL SECURITY CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE PROVIDED FOR-------- UNDER THE 1960 SECURITY TREATY. THIS SUBCOMMITTEE, IN TURN, DREW UP NEW-------- GUIDELINES FOR JAPAN-UNITED STATES DEFENSE COOPERATION, UNDER WHICH-------- MILITARY PLANNERS OF THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE CONDUCTED STUDIES RELATING-------- TO JOINT MILITARY ACTION IN THE EVENT OF AN ARMED ATTACK ON JAPAN.----------- ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT, JAPAN SOUGHT TO EASE TRADE FRICTIONS BY-------- AGREEING TO ORDERLY MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH LIMITED EXPORTS ON-------- PRODUCTS WHOSE INFLUX INTO THE UNITED STATES WAS CREATING POLITICAL-------- PROBLEMS. IN 1977 AN ORDERLY MARKETING ARRANGEMENT LIMITING JAPANESE-------- COLOR TELEVISION EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES WAS SIGNED, FOLLOWING THE-------- PATTERN OF AN EARLIER DISPOSITION OF THE TEXTILE PROBLEM. STEEL EXPORTS-------- TO THE UNITED STATES WERE ALSO CURTAILED, BUT THE PROBLEMS CONTINUED AS-------- DISPUTES FLARED OVER UNITED STATES RESTRICTIONS ON JAPANESE DEVELOPMENT-------- OF NUCLEAR FUEL- REPROCESSING FACILITIES, JAPANESE RESTRICTIONS ON-------- CERTAIN AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS, SUCH AS BEEF AND ORANGES, AND-------- LIBERALIZATION OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT WITHIN-------- JAPAN.----------- TO RESPOND TO THE CALL, FROM ITS ALLIES AND FROM WITHIN THE COUNTRY-------- AS WELL, FOR A GREATER AND MORE RESPONSIBLE ROLE IN THE WORLD, JAPAN-------- DEVELOPED WHAT OHIRA MASAYOSHI, AFTER HE BECAME PRIME MINISTER IN-------- DECEMBER 1978, CALLED A----- "COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY AND DEFENSE-------- STRATEGY TO SAFEGUARD PEACE.-----" UNDER THIS POLICY, JAPAN SOUGHT TO-------- PLACE ITS RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES ON A NEW FOOTING--ONE OF-------- CLOSE COOPERATION BUT ON A MORE RECIPROCAL AND AUTONOMOUS BASIS, AND ON-------- A GLOBAL SCALE.----------- THIS POLICY WAS PUT TO THE TEST IN NOVEMBER 1979, WHEN RADICAL-------- IRANIANS SEIZED THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN TEHRAN, TAKING SIXTY-------- HOSTAGES. JAPAN REACTED BY CONDEMNING THE ACTION AS A VIOLATION OF-------- INTERNATIONAL LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, JAPANESE TRADING FIRMS AND OIL-------- COMPANIES REPORTEDLY PURCHASED IRANIAN OIL THAT HAD BECOME AVAILABLE-------- WHEN THE UNITED STATES BANNED OIL IMPORTED FROM IRAN. THIS ACTION-------- BROUGHT SHARP CRITICISM FROM THE UNITED STATES OF JAPANESE GOVERNMENT------------- "INSENSITIVITY-----" FOR ALLOWING THE OIL PURCHASES AND LED TO A-------- JAPANESE APOLOGY AND AGREEMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN-------- IN CONCERT WITH OTHER UNITED STATES ALLIES.----------- FOLLOWING THAT INCIDENT, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT TOOK GREATER CARE TO-------- SUPPORT UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL POLICIES DESIGNED TO PRESERVE-------- STABILITY AND PROMOTE PROSPERITY. JAPAN WAS PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE IN-------- ANNOUNCING AND IMPLEMENTING SANCTIONS AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION FOLLOWING-------- THE SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN IN DECEMBER------ IN 1981, IN-------- RESPONSE TO UNITED STATES REQUESTS, IT ACCEPTED GREATER RESPONSIBILITY-------- FOR DEFENSE OF SEAS AROUND JAPAN, PLEDGED GREATER SUPPORT FOR UNITED-------- STATES FORCES IN JAPAN, AND PERSISTED WITH A STEADY BUILDUP OF THE SDF.----------- A QUALITATIVELY NEW STAGE OF JAPAN-UNITED STATES COOPERATION IN WORLD-------- AFFAIRS APPEARED TO BE REACHED IN LATE 1982 WITH THE ELECTION OF PRIME-------- MINISTER NAKASONE YASUHIRO. OFFICIALS OF THE RONALD REAGAN-------- ADMINISTRATION WORKED CLOSELY WITH THEIR JAPANESE COUNTERPARTS TO-------- DEVELOP A PERSONAL-RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN-THE TWO LEADERS BASED ON THEIR-------- COMMON SECURITY AND INTERNATIONAL OUTLOOK. NAKASONE REASSURED UNITED-------- STATES LEADERS OF JAPAN'S DETERMINATION AGAINST THE SOVIET THREAT--------, CLOSELY COORDINATED POLICIES WITH-THE UNITED STATES TOWARD SUCH ASIAN-------- TROUBLE SPOTS AS THE KOREAN PENINSULA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND WORKED-------- COOPERATIVELY WITH THE UNITED STATES IN DEVELOPING CHINA POLICY. THE-------- JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WELCOMED THE INCREASE OF UNITED STATES FORCES IN-------- JAPAN AND THE WESTERN PACIFIC, CONTINUED THE STEADY BUILDUP OF THE SDF--------, AND POSITIONED JAPAN FIRMLY ON THE SIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST THE-------- THREAT OF SOVIET INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION. JAPAN CONTINUED TO COOPERATE-------- CLOSELY WITH UNITED STATES-POLICY IN THESE AREAS FOLLOWING NAKASONE'S-------- TERM OF OFFICE, ALTHOUGH THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP SCANDALS IN JAPAN IN-------- THE LATE 1980S MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH-------- TO ESTABLISH THE SAME KIND OF CLOSE PERSONAL TIES THAT MARKED THE REAGAN-------- YEARS.----------- A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF JAPAN'S CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED-------- STATES INCLUDED ITS QUICK RESPONSE TO THE UNITED STATES CALL FOR GREATER-------- HOST NATION SUPPORT FROM JAPAN FOLLOWING THE RAPID REALIGNMENT OF-------- JAPAN-UNITED STATES CURRENCIES IN THE MID-1980S. THE CURRENCY-------- REALIGNMENT RESULTED IN A RAPID RISE OF UNITED STATES COSTS IN JAPAN--------, WHICH THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT--UPON UNITED STATES REQUEST, WAS WILLING-------- TO OFFSET. ANOTHER SET OF EXAMPLES WAS-PROVIDED BY JAPAN'S WILLINGNESS-------- TO RESPOND TO UNITED STATES REQUESTS FOR FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES-------- CONSIDERED OF STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TO THE WEST. DURING THE 1---S, UNITED-------- STATES OFFICIALS VOICED APPRECIATION FOR JAPAN'S----- "STRATEGIC-------- AID-----" TO COUNTRIES SUCH AS PAKISTAN, TURKEY, EGYPT, AND JAMAICA.-------- PRIME MINISTER KAIFU TOSHIKI'S PLEDGES OF SUPPORT FOR EAST EUROPEAN AND-------- MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES IN 1990 FIT THE PATTERN OF JAPAN'S WILLINGNESS-------- TO SHARE GREATER RESPONSIBILITY FOR WORLD STABILITY.----------- DESPITE COMPLAINTS FROM SOME JAPANESE BUSINESSES AND DIPLOMATS, THE-------- JAPANESE GOVERNMENT REMAINED IN BASIC AGREEMENT WITH UNITED STATES-------- POLICY TOWARD CHINA AND INDOCHINA. THE GOVERNMENT HELD BACK FROM-------- LARGE-SCALE AID EFFORTS UNTIL CONDITIONS IN CHINA AND INDOCHINA WERE-------- SEEN AS MORE COMPATIBLE WITH JAPANESE AND UNITED STATES INTERESTS. OF-------- COURSE, THERE ALSO WERE INSTANCES OF LIMITED JAPANESE COOPERATION.-------- JAPAN'S RESPONSE TO THE UNITED STATES DECISION TO HELP TO PROTECT-------- TANKERS IN THE PERSIAN GULF DURING THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR (1980-88) WAS-------- SUBJECT TO MIXED REVIEWS. SOME UNITED STATES OFFICIALS STRESSED THE-------- POSITIVE, NOTING THAT JAPAN WAS UNABLE TO SEND MILITARY FORCES BECAUSE-------- OF CONSTITUTIONAL REASONS BUT COMPENSATED BY SUPPORTING THE CONSTRUCTION-------- OF A NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE PERSIAN GULF, PROVIDING GREATER HOST-------- NATION SUPPORT FOR UNITED STATES FORCES IN JAPAN, AND PROVIDING LOANS TO-------- OMAN AND JORDAN. JAPAN'S REFUSAL TO-------- JOIN EVEN IN A MINE-SWEEPING EFFORT IN THE PERSIAN GULF WAS AN-------- INDICATION TO SOME UNITED STATES OFFICIALS OF TOKYO'S UNWILLINGNESS TO-------- COOPERATE WITH THE UNITED STATES IN AREAS OF SENSITIVITY TO JAPANESE-------- LEADERS AT HOME OR ABROAD.----------- THE MAIN AREA OF NONCOOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES IN THE 1980S-------- WAS JAPANESE RESISTANCE TO REPEATED UNITED STATES EFFORTS TO GET JAPAN-------- TO OPEN ITS MARKET MORE TO FOREIGN GOODS AND TO CHANGE OTHER ECONOMIC-------- PRACTICES SEEN AS ADVERSE TO UNITED STATES ECONOMIC INTERESTS. A COMMON-------- PATTERN WAS FOLLOWED. THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WAS SENSITIVE TO POLITICAL-------- PRESSURES FROM IMPORTANT DOMESTIC CONSTITUENCIES THAT WOULD BE HURT BY-------- GREATER OPENNESS. IN GENERAL, THESE CONSTITUENCIES WERE OF TWO-------- TYPES--THOSE REPRESENTING INEFFICIENT OR----- "DECLINING-------------" PRODUCERS, MANUFACTURERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS, WHO COULD NOT COMPETE IF-------- FACED WITH FULL FOREIGN COMPETITION; AND THOSE UP-AND-COMING INDUSTRIES-------- THAT THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WISHED TO PROTECT FROM FOREIGN COMPETITION-------- UNTIL THEY COULD COMPETE EFFECTIVELY ON WORLD MARKETS. TO DEAL WITH-------- DOMESTIC PRESSURES WHILE TRYING TO AVOID A BREAK WITH THE UNITED STATES--------, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT ENGAGED IN PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS. THIS TACTIC-------- BOUGHT TIME FOR DECLINING INDUSTRIES TO RESTRUCTURE THEMSELVES AND NEW-------- INDUSTRIES TO GROW STRONGER. AGREEMENTS REACHED DEALT WITH SOME ASPECTS-------- OF THE PROBLEMS, BUT IT WAS COMMON FOR TRADE OR ECONOMIC ISSUES TO BE-------- DRAGGED OUT IN TALKS OVER SEVERAL YEARS, INVOLVING MORE THAN ONE-------- MARKET-OPENING AGREEMENT. SUCH AGREEMENTS WERE SOMETIMES VAGUE AND-------- SUBJECT TO CONFLICTING INTERPRETATIONS IN JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES.----------- DURING THE 1970S AND 1980S, UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATIONS HAD FAVORED-------- AN ISSUE-BY-ISSUE APPROACH IN NEGOTIATING SUCH ECONOMIC DISPUTES WITH-------- JAPAN. THIS APPROACH OSTENSIBLY LIMITED THE AREAS OF DISPUTE. BUT IT-------- RESULTED IN WIDESPREAD NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, AT A TIME WHEN CHANGING-------- ECONOMIC AND SECURITY CIRCUMSTANCES WERE CAUSING BOTH COUNTRIES TO-------- REEVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP. NOTABLE OUTPOURINGS OF UNITED STATES-------- CONGRESSIONAL AND MEDIA RHETORIC CRITICAL OF JAPAN ACCOMPANIED THE-------- DISCLOSURE IN 1987 THAT TOSHIBA HAD ILLEGALLY SOLD SOPHISTICATED-------- MACHINERY OF UNITED STATES ORIGIN TO THE SOVIET UNION, WHICH REPORTEDLY-------- ALLOWED MOSCOW TO MAKE SUBMARINES QUIET ENOUGH TO AVOID UNITED STATES-------- DETECTION, AND THE UNITED STATES CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE IN 1989 OVER THE-------- JAPAN-UNITED STATES AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP A NEW FIGHTER AIRCRAFT--THE-------- FSX--FOR JAPAN'S AIR SELF- DEFENSE FORCE.----------- A NEW APPROACH WAS ADDED IN------ THE SO-CALLED STRUCTURAL-------- IMPEDIMENTS INITIATIVE WAS A SERIES OF TALKS DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH-------- DOMESTIC STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS LIMITING TRADE ON BOTH SIDES. AFTER SEVERAL-------- ROUNDS OF OFTEN CONTENTIOUS TALKS, AGREEMENTS WERE REACHED IN APRIL AND-------- JULY 1990 THAT PROMISED MAJOR CHANGES IN SUCH SENSITIVE AREAS AS-------- JAPANESE RETAILING PRACTICES, LAND USE, AND INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC WORKS.-------- THE UNITED STATES PLEDGED TO DEAL MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH ITS BUDGET-------- DEFICIT AND TO INCREASE DOMESTIC SAVINGS. UNITED STATES SUPPORTERS SAW-------- THE STRUCTURAL IMPEDIMENTS INITIATIVE TALKS AS ADDRESSING FUNDAMENTAL-------- CAUSES OF JAPAN-UNITED STATES ECONOMIC FRICTION. SKEPTICS POINTED TO-------- THEM AS WAYS FOR OFFICIALS TO BUY TIME AND AVOID AN ACUTE CRISIS IN-------- JAPAN-UNITED STATES RELATIONS. THE BILL CLINTON ADMINISTRATION DECIDED-------- TO END THE STRUCTURAL IMPEDIMENTS INITIATIVE IN THE SUMMER OF 1993 AS A-------- FRAMEWORK FOR DEALING WITH UNITED STATES-JAPAN BILATERAL RELATIONS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
