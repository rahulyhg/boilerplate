THE CHAIR ADVISED THAT THE-------- MEMORIAL RESOLUTION ON THE AGENDA WAS BEING RESCHEDULED-------- TO THE NEXT MEETING.----------------------------------------------------- REPORT FROM THE SENATE-------- STEERING COMMITTEE----------------------------------------------------- OSGOOD THANKED THOSE AT-------- SLAC FOR THE VERY SUCCESSFUL SENATE MEETING AND TOUR ON-------- JANUARY 11TH. HE JOKED THAT IF THE NEXT SENATE------------- "FIELD TRIP-----" COULDN'T BE TO HAWAII, HE MIGHT-------- TRY TO ARRANGE FOR THE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR TO TAKE EVERYONE---------TO THE FINAL FOUR. OSGOOD INFORMED SENATE-MEMBERS THAT-------- THEIR FALL QUARTER DISCUSSION ON ADVISING HAD LED TO THE-------- RECENT ACTIVATION OF THE C-US SUBCOMMITTEE ON RESIDENTIAL-------- EDUCATION AND ADVISING (S-REA). IT HAD BEEN CHARGED AMONG-------- OTHER THINGS TO----- "DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR FACULTY-------- MENTORING OF FRESHMEN AND SOPHOMORES-----" AND TO------------- "PLAN A PROGRAM TO INCREASE THE QUALITY OF MENTORING-------- AT THE UPPER LEVELS.-----" THE SUBCOMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY-------- PROFESSOR ELIZABETH BERNHARDT, INCLUDES FACULTY MEMBERS-------- BRAD GREGORY (HISTORY), LYNN HILDEMANN (CIVIL AND-------- ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING), DOUG OSHEROFF (PHYSICS--------), SENIOR LECTURER JULIE KENNEDY (EARTH SYSTEMS), THREE-------- STUDENTS, AND THREE--- EX-OFFICIO---- STAFF MEMBERS.-------- OSGOOD INDICATED THAT DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE ADVISING-------- LORI WHITE WELCOMED THE ASSISTANCE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AS-------- WELL AS INPUT FROM ANY AND-ALL FACULTY MEMBERS.------------------------------------------------------THE CHAIR ALSO REPORTED-------- THAT THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PLANNING AND POLICY-------- BOARD, CONSISTING OF HIMSELF AND FORMER SENATE CHAIRS-------- ZOBACK AND EFRON, HAD CONSIDERED SUGGESTIONS FOR-------- POTENTIAL PPB TOPICS, BUT HAD DECIDED NOT TO CONVENE PPB-------- STARTING IN THE FALL. HE SAID THAT THEY ANTICIPATED THE-------- POSSIBILITY OF PPB BEING APPOINTED LATER IN THE YEAR IN-------- CONNECTION WITH THE RESULTS OF THE PROVOST'S UNIVERSITY-------- NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS, AND THAT THEY WELCOMED OTHER-------- FACULTY SUGGESTIONS. OSGOOD PREVIEWED UPCOMING SENATE---------AGENDA ITEMS, AND REMINDED EVERYONE OF THE ANNUAL MEETING-------- OF THE ACADEMIC COUNCIL ON-MARCH 8TH. VICE PROVOST---------BRAVMAN ASKED WHAT PURPOSE WAS SERVED BY THE----- "ALWAYS-------- EMPTY ACTION CALENDAR-----" ON THE-AGENDA. THE ACADEMIC---------SECRETARY EXPLAINED THAT DEGREES ARE CONFERRED QUARTERLY-------- UNDER THE ACTION CALENDAR--AS WELL AS OCCASIONAL OTHER-------- ITEMS, WHICH ARE TO BE VOTED ON AS PRESENTED, WITHOUT-------- AMENDMENT.----------------------------------------------------- REPORT FROM THE-------- COMMITTEE ON COMMITTEES----------------------------------------------------- COC CHAIR LIPSICK-------- ADVISED THAT THEY HAD RESPONDED TO THE PROVOST'S REQUEST-------- FOR FACULTY MEMBERS TO SERVE ON A SMALL, AD HOC COMMITTEE-------- TO REVIEW THE MATERNITY PROVISIONS OF THE TENURE POLICY.-------- COC HAD ALSO BEGUN ITS REGULAR WORK OF IDENTIFYING-------- POTENTIAL MEMBERS FOR FALL 2001 VACANCIES ON VARIOUS-------- COMMITTEES, HE SAID, AND URGED FACULTY MEMBERS TO SAY YES-------- IF ASKED TO SERVE.----------------------------------------------------- REPORTS FROM THE-------- PRESIDENT AND THE PROVOST----------------------------------------------------- THE PROVOST WAS ABSENT.-------- PRESIDENT HENNESSY REPORTED WITH RELIEF THAT HE HAD-------- FILLED THREE MAJOR ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS. HE SAID THAT------------- "ACTING-----" HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM GENERAL COUNSEL-------- DEBRA ZUMWALT'S TITLE, FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATION OF A-------- BLUE RIBBON PANEL THAT EXAMINED THE POSITION. LADORIS-------- CORDELL WOULD BE ASSUMING THE POST OF VICE PROVOST AND-------- SPECIAL COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT FOR CAMPUS RELATIONS--------, HENNESSY SAID, RETURNING TO STANFORD AFTER 19 YEARS AS A-------- SANTA CLARA COUNTY JUDGE. AND HE ANNOUNCED THAT RANDY-------- LIVINGSTON WOULD ARRIVE IN MID-MARCH AS CHIEF FINANCIAL-------- OFFICER AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR BUSINESS AFFAIRS.----------------------------------------------------- PRESIDENT HENNESSY ALSO-------- SPOKE BRIEFLY ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA UTILITIES CRISIS--------, EXPLAINING THAT STANFORD HAS A COGENERATION PLANT, OWNED-------- AND OPERATED BY A THIRD PARTY, THAT PROVIDES POWER TO ITS-------- ACADEMIC FACILITIES AND THAT SELLS BACK EXCESS POWER INTO-------- THE PG----&E GRID.----- "IN ADDITION TO AVOIDING ROLLING-------- BLACKOUTS, WE-ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION RATHER THAN PART-------- OF THE PROBLEM,-----" HE SAID. THE UNIVERSITY URGES ALL-------- MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO EVALUATE THEIR USAGE OF-------- ELECTRICITY AND TO TRY TO CONSERVE IT, MAKING AS MUCH-------- POWER AS POSSIBLE----- "AVAILABLE TO OUR NEIGHBORS AND-------- THE REST OF THE STATE.-----" HENNESSY INDICATED THAT-------- STANFORD'S ENERGY USAGE HAD GONE UP STEADILY FOR SEVERAL-------- YEARS, AND THAT DRAMATIC INCREASES IN NATURAL GAS AND-------- ELECTRICITY PRICES WOULD PROBABLY RESULT IN A $5 MILLION-------- HIT TO THE UNIVERSITY BUDGET. HE ENCOURAGED ANYONE WITH-------- IDEAS ABOUT WAYS TO CONSERVE ENERGY TO CONTACT CHRIS-------- CHRISTOFFERSON, ASSOCIATE VICE PROVOST FOR FACILITIES-------- (725-0296). DEAN ORR (SCHOOL OF EARTH SCIENCES) AND-------- PROFESSOR NOLL (ECONOMICS) JOKED THAT STANFORD COULD-------- CLOSE DOWN EVERY-FRIDAY AND GET RICH BY SELLING-------- ELECTRICITY AT----- "EXTORTIONIST PRICES.-----" HENNESSY-------- SAID THAT UNFORTUNATELY THE UNIVERSITY HAD A LONG-TERM-------- AGREEMENT THAT DID NOT INCLUDE STANFORD SHARING IN ANY-------- PROFITS.----------------------------------------------------- PROFESSOR REHM (DRAMA--------) ADVISED THE SENATE OF THE FORMATION OF AN INFORMAL-------- COMMITTEE OF SENATORS INCLUDING HIMSELF, DEBRA SATZ--------, DAVID ABERNETHY, ROB POLHEMUS, YVONNE YARBRO-BEJARANO--------, DAVID PALUMBO-LIU, BERNIE ROTH AND ASSU PRESIDENT SETH-------- NEWTON, WHO WISHED TO MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT AND THE-------- PROVOST ABOUT THE NIKE CONTRACTS-WITH STANFORD. HE-------- MENTIONED LABOR PROBLEMS AT NIKE FACTORIES, STUDENT-------- PROTESTS AT SEVERAL UNIVERSITIES, A CITIZEN LAWSUIT-------- SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL LOCKYER, AND-------- SEVERAL RECENT BOOKS AND ARTICLES ABOUT COLLEGE-------- ATHLETICS.----- "ALL OF THIS PUTS SOME PRESSURE ON-------- STANFORD TO JUSTIFY ITS CONTINUING TO CONTRACT WITH-------- NIKE,-----" HE SAID. HE ALSO MADE----- "A MODEST-------- PROPOSAL-----" THAT IF STANFORD NEEDS MONEY SO BADLY THAT-------- IT HAS TO SELL ADVERTISING ON STUDENT ATHLETE UNIFORMS--------, MAYBE IT OUGHT TO APPROACH NIKE AND ADIDAS AND REEBOK AND------------- "CUT A SIMILAR DEAL-----" FOR CLOTHING THAT ALL THE-------- FACULTY WOULD WEAR, LIKE THE STUDENTS. HENNESSY REMINDED-------- EVERYONE THAT THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT FUND ANY VARSITY-------- SPORTS, AND THAT ATHLETICS IS STRETCHED TO COVER ITS-------- BUDGET COMMITMENTS SINCE ADVERTISING WAS REMOVED FROM-------- VENUES SUCH AS MAPLES PAVILION. HE SAID THAT HE IS-------- CONCERNED THAT CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP CONFUSES THE NOTION-------- OF AMATEUR SPORTS AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL, BUT ALSO-------- RECOGNIZES THAT IT IS A REALITY TO BE CONTENDED WITH. HE-------- NOTED THAT NIKE HAD KEPT STANFORD APPRISED OF LABOR-------- ISSUES, AND HE SUGGESTED THAT ENGAGING WITH THEM ABOUT-------- SUCH ISSUES MIGHT CAUSE THEM TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO-------- THEM. HENNESSY ASKED REHM AND THE GROUP TO MEET WITH-------- ATHLETICS DIRECTOR TED LELAND TO INFORM THEMSELVES ABOUT-------- ATHLETIC SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENTS AND RELEVANT ISSUES--------, ADDING THAT----- "WE WILL BE HAPPY TO MEET WITH ANY-------- FACULTY WHO ARE CONCERNED.-----" HENNESSY NOTED THAT HE-------- HAD READ THE BOOKS REHM MENTIONED, AND RECOMMENDED THE-------- BOOK BY WILLIAM BOWEN AND JAMES SCHULMAN,--- THE GAME OF-------- LIFE: COLLEGE SPORTS AND EDUCATIONAL VALUES--------------------------------------------------------- NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY-------- PROGRAM IN ARCHAEOLOGY (SEND#5149)----------------------------------------------------- CHAIR OSGOOD COMMENTED-------- THAT THE NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM RECOMMENDED BY THE-------- COMMITTEE ON UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES DRAWS ON EXISTING-------- FACULTY STRENGTHS IN CLASSICS, ANTHROPOLOGY, AND GEOLOGY--------, AND REFLECTS CONSIDERABLE STUDENT INTEREST. HE WELCOMED-------- C-US CHAIR HESTER GELBER TO PRESENT THE RECOMMENDATION--------, ALONG WITH GUESTS INCLUDING H----&S ASSOCIATE DEAN-------- RUSSELL BERMAN AND PROFESSORS IAN MORRIS (CLASSICS), IAN-------- HODDER (CULTURAL AND SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY), GAIL MAHOOD-------- (GEOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES), AND JOHN RICK-------- (ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES), ALL MEMBERS OF THE PROGRAM'S-------- EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.----------------------------------------------------- GELBER ADVISED THAT C-US-------- HAD RECEIVED A RECOMMENDATION TO INITIATE THE PROGRAM-------- FROM THE HUMANITIES AND SCIENCES CURRICULUM COMMITTEE AND-------- DEANS. AFTER DISCUSSING THE DEGREE OF SUPPORT AVAILABLE-------- FROM THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS, THE CURRICULUM, PROVISIONS-------- FOR ADVISING, AND THE GENERAL QUALITY OF THE PROGRAM--------, THEY FOUND IT TO BE IMPRESSIVE AND WELL THOUGHT THROUGH--------, SHE SAID. BERMAN ADDED THAT H---- & S FIRMLY SUPPORTS THE-------- PROPOSAL, WHICH EMANATES FROM THE ARCHAEOLOGY CENTER--------, FUNDED IN 1998/99 BY SEED MONEY FROM THE PRESIDENT'S-------- FUND. HE ADVISED THAT H---- & S WAS PREPARED TO PROVIDE-------- BASE BUDGET SUPPORT AS IT CAME TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE-------- SIZE OF STUDENT INTEREST.----------------------------------------------------- PROFESSOR PALUMBO-LIU-------- (COMPARATIVE LITERATURE) OFFERED SEVERAL COMMENTS--------, INCLUDING A SUGGESTION THAT THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE-------- REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE SET AT----- "B-----" RATHER THAN------------- "B MINUS.-----" HE ALSO ASKED ABOUT FINANCIAL-------- ARRANGEMENTS FOR REQUIRED FIELDWORK, ENCOURAGED MORE OF-------- AN EMPHASIS ON ASIA AND THE PACIFIC RIM, AND SUGGESTED-------- THAT THE IMPORTANT COURSE ON ETHICS EXPAND ITS FOCUS TO-------- INCLUDE----- "THE EFFECTS OF CONQUEST AND-------- IMPERIALISM.-----" CO-DIRECTORS MORRIS AND HODDER NOTED-------- THAT FIELDWORK IS A CENTRAL PART OF ARCHAEOLOGY. IT WAS-------- BEING ARRANGED EITHER ON THE STANFORD CAMPUS WITH VERY-------- LOW COST TO STUDENTS, OR AT OVERSEAS SITES, FUNDED IN-------- DIFFERENT WAYS- BUT GENERALLY NOT BURDENING STUDENTS-------- FINANCIALLY, EXCEPT PERHAPS IN LOST OPPORTUNITIES FOR-------- SUMMER WAGES. THEY AGREED THAT THEY WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE-------- TO BECOME INVOLVED IN ASIA,----- "IF ONLY WE CAN COME UP-------- WITH A COUPLE MORE FACULTY BILLETS.-----" HODDER-------- INDICATED THAT BROAD ATTENTION TO VARIOUS ETHICAL-------- DIMENSIONS OF ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE MODERN WORLD WOULD BE-------- EXPLORED IN HIS COURSE. PROFESSOR SHOVEN (ECONOMICS) SAID-------- THAT HE BELIEVED THE SENATE SHOULD NOT BE IN THE BUSINESS-------- OF DECIDING SPECIFIC GRADE REQUIREMENTS FOR COURSES-------- WITHIN A PROGRAM.----------------------------------------------------- PROFESSOR NOLL-------- (ECONOMICS) COMMENTED THAT HE STRONGLY SUPPORTED THE NEW-------- PROGRAM, BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH TWO ASPECTS OF THE-------- PROPOSAL. FIRST, HE EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT CORE COURSES-------- SHOULD BE OFFERED EVERY YEAR, NOT EVERY OTHER YEAR, GIVEN-------- THE PROPENSITY OF STANFORD STUDENTS TO HAVE DIVERSE-------- INTERESTS AND COMMITMENTS OFF CAMPUS THAT COULD LEAD TO-------- SCHEDULING PROBLEMS IN THE MAJOR. SECOND, HE SAID IT-------- APPEARED TO HIM THAT STUDENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO FULFILL-------- THE MAJOR WITHOUT ACTUALLY ACQUIRING INTERDISCIPLINARY-------- BREADTH. HE SUGGESTED THAT BREADTH SHOULD BE REQUIRED IN-------- BOTH THE ANALYTIC METHODS AND THE SKILLS COURSES.----- "I-------- WOULD THINK THAT THIS PROGRAM MIGHT WANT TO PRODUCE A NEW-------- KIND OF GEOLOGIST, OR A NEW KIND OF CLASSICIST, OR A NEW-------- KIND OF ANTHROPOLOGIST, WHO WAS ACTUALLY VERY SKILLED IN-------- THOSE OTHER FIELDS,-----" NOLL OBSERVED. MAHOOD SAID SHE-------- EXPECTS STUDENTS TO BE ATTRACTED TO THE PROGRAM AT LEAST-------- IN PART BECAUSE OF DIMENSIONS BEYOND ANTHROPOLOGY, SUCH-------- AS EARTH SCIENCES. SHE SAID THAT THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE-------- WOULD BE THINKING ABOUT FURTHER CONSTRAINTS IN THE MAJOR-------- AS STUDENT INTERESTS BECOME MORE CLEAR. HODDER ASSURED-------- NOLL THAT THE NOTION OF BREADTH WAS FIRMLY IMBEDDED IN-------- THE FACULTY'S VISION FOR THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF IT DID NOT-------- COME THROUGH IN-THE DESCRIPTION. GELBER NOTED THAT C-US-------- HAD EXPLORED SIMILAR CONCERNS, AND WAS SATISFIED THAT THE-------- STUDENT ADVISING PROCESS WOULD STRONGLY GUIDE STUDENTS TO-------- MAKE APPROPRIATE CHOICES WITHIN THE MAJOR.----------------------------------------------------- THE FOLLOWING MOTION--------, MOVED AND SECONDED BY THE COMMITTEE ON UNDERGRADUATE-------- STUDIES, WAS APPROVED BY VOICE VOTE WITHOUT DISSENT:-------------------------------------------------------- THE SENATE APPROVES-------- THE INITIATION OF THE INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM IN-------- ARCHAEOLOGY AND AUTHORIZES THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE-------- INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM IN ARCHAEOLOGY TO NOMINATE-------- CANDIDATES FOR THE B. A. DEGREE FOR FIVE YEARS EFFECTIVE-------- SEPTEMBER 1, 2001 THROUGH AUGUST 31,--------------------------------------------------------------- 1999/2000 ANNUAL REPORT-------- FROM THE COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION-------- SYSTEMS (SEND#5123)----------------------------------------------------- SENATE CHAIR BRAD-------- OSGOOD, HAVING SERVED AS THE 1999/2000 CHAIR OF C-ACIS--------, HANDED THE GAVEL TO THE ACADEMIC SECRETARY AND STEPPED-------- FORWARD TO PRESENT THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT. OSGOOD-------- IDENTIFIED AND-THANKED COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF, AND---------INDICATED THAT C-ACIS OVER THE YEARS----- "CYCLES-------- THROUGH-----" DISCUSSION OF BASIC COMPUTING ISSUES SUCH-------- AS INFRASTRUCTURE, THE NETWORK AND ITS SUPPORT,---------ADMINISTRATIVE COMPUTING, GENERAL COMPUTING SUPPORT, AND-------- NETWORK SECURITY. HE EXPLAINED THAT FOR C-ACIS AND THE-------- OTHER SIX ACADEMIC COUNCIL COMMITTEES, IMPORTANT THINGS-------- OFTEN HAPPEN NOT AS FORMAL COMMITTEE ACTIONS, BUT RATHER-------- AS A RESULT OF THE SENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS WHO-------- SERVE--- EX-OFFICIO---- BEING RESPONSIVE TO FACULTY-------- VIEWPOINTS AND GOING AWAY AND----- "GETTING THINGS-------- DONE.-----" OSGOOD SUMMARIZED THE MAIN THEMES OF THE-------- PRIOR YEAR, EMPHASIZING DEPARTMENTAL COMPUTING SUPPORT-------- AND----- "COMPUTING AS A PUBLIC GOOD.-----" HE PROVIDED-------- SOME STRIKING STATISTICS CONCERNING THE EXTENT OF-------- COMPUTING EQUIPMENT REQUIRING SOME LEVEL OF SUPPORT AT-------- STANFORD: ROUGHLY 60,000 DESKTOP MACHINES (60% PC--------, 30% MAC, 10% UNIX); 516 SUBNETS WITH 50,000 NODES; AND MORE-------- THAN 100% GROWTH IN WEB PAGES AND 1,000% GROWTH IN DISK-------- SPACE BETWEEN 1994 AND------ THE COMMITTEE HAD CONSIDERED-------- TWO ALTERNATIVE MODELS FOR----- "COMPUTING AS A PUBLIC-------- GOOD,-----" HE SAID -- THE LIBRARY MODEL (CENTRALLY-------- FUNDED, SHARED RESOURCES) VERSUS THE UTILITIES MODEL-------- (CHARGES FOR SERVICES BASED ON USAGE). OSGOOD NOTED THAT-------- THIS WAS A LARGE TOPIC, COMPLICATED BY THE SIGNIFICANT-------- VARIATIONS AMONG DEPARTMENTS, AND THAT DISCUSSIONS WERE-------- ONGOING IN C-ACIS THIS YEAR.----------------------------------------------------- PROFESSOR PAUL SEGALL--------, C-ACIS CHAIR FOR 2000/2001, ADVISED THAT THE COMMITTEE-------- WAS DIVIDING ITS AGENDA BY QUARTER, FOCUSING ON TEACHING--------, THEN RESEARCH, THEN ADDITIONAL ISSUES. HE MENTIONED THAT-------- AS PART OF THE PROVOST'S NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS, A-------- SUBCOMMITTEE WAS LOOKING AT LONG-TERM INFRASTRUCTURE-------- NEEDS FOR ACADEMIC COMPUTING, AND HOPED THAT AS MANY-------- FACULTY MEMBERS AS POSSIBLE WOULD RESPOND TO A SURVEY TO-------- BE DISTRIBUTED IN FEBRUARY. SEGALL SAID THAT IN ADDITION-------- TO THE TEN-YEAR HORIZON OF-THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT-PROCESS--------, C-ACIS HOPED TO PRIORITIZE SOME MORE IMMEDIATE NEEDS, AND-------- WELCOMED FACULTY INPUT.----------------------------------------------------- PROFESSOR PAPANICOLAOU-------- (MATHEMATICS) EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT INCREASES IN-------- LICENSING COSTS FOR THE MATLAB SOFTWARE THAT WERE-------- AFFECTING A LARGE NUMBER OF FACULTY MEMBERS IN SCIENCES-------- AND-ENGINEERING. HE URGED C-ACIS TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP-------- ROLE IN SOLVING THE PROBLEM. SEGALL MENTIONED THAT AN-------- ITSS STAFF MEMBER, PAT BOX, WAS IN CHARGE OF SOFTWARE-------- LICENSING AND WAS ATTEMPTING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE-------- COMPANY. PROFESSOR NOLL (ECONOMICS) SAID HE SEES C-ACIS-------- AS HAVING A VERY SMALL NET AND CHASING AFTER A BIG-------- ELEPHANT, AND HE QUESTIONED WHETHER THEY COULD EVER BE-------- PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE. OSGOOD STRESSED THE ROLE OF-------- C-ACIS IN OVERSIGHT AND AS A-FACULTY SOUNDING BOARD, AND-------- OTHERS MENTIONED SPECIFIC POLICIES AND ACTIONS IN THE-------- PAST FEW YEARS THAT HAD RESULTED FROM THE COMMITTEE'S-------- WORK. PROFESSOR TATUM (CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL-------- ENGINEERING) EXPRESSED THE VIEW OF SEVERAL FACULTY-------- MEMBERS THAT INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BECOME------------- "AS IMPORTANT AS CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER-----" AND-------- URGED C-ACIS TO ADVOCATE FOR CURRENT INVESTMENTS TO-------- ENSURE LONG-TERM INFRASTRUCTURE ADEQUACY.-IT WAS AGREED--------, AT-THE SUGGESTION OF PROFESSOR ROTH (MECHANICAL-------- ENGINEERING), THAT THE ANNUAL REPORT SHOULD BE CORRECTED-------- TO SPELL OUT ALL ACRONYMS. THE ACADEMIC SECRETARY-------- ACCEPTED THE 1999/2000 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON-------- ACADEMIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS ON BEHALF OF-------- THE SENATE, AND THANKED THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS WORK.----------------------------------------------------- REPOR--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------T ON STAFF RETENTION-AND RECRUITMENT ISSUES, A TOPIC-------- OF REAL INTEREST TO-MANY FACULTY MEMBERS. CAMMIDGE, AT-------- STANFORD FOR EIGHT MONTHS, ADVISED THAT HE WANTED TO-------- PRESENT AND EXPLAIN A GOOD DEAL OF DATA, PROVIDED TO-------- SENATE MEMBERS IN ADVANCE, AND TO INVITE ALL MEMBERS OF-------- THE FACULTY TO TAKE AN INCREASED INVOLVEMENT IN THE-------- WELL-BEING OF STAFF.----------------------------------------------------- SUMMARIZING DATA-------- CONCERNING STAFF TURNOVER AT STANFORD, CAMMIDGE ADVISED-------- THAT STANFORD'S----- "SEPARATION RATE-----" (PRIMARILY-------- VOLUNTARY DEPARTURES, BUT ALSO INCLUDING LAYOFF--------, DISMISSAL, RETIREMENT AND DEATH) IS NOW 25.5% PER YEAR--------, UP FROM 10.6% IN------ THE STANFORD RATE MIRRORS THAT IN-------- SILICON VALLEY, HE SAID, BUT THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS ONLY-------- 12-14%. CONCERNING TOTAL COMPENSATION COMPETITIVENESS--------, ACCORDING TO CAMMIDGE, STANFORD BENEFITS ARE VERY-------- COMPETITIVE, BASE COMPENSATION IS GENERALLY COMPETITIVE-------- AT THE MIDDLE OF THE BAY AREA MARKETPLACE, AND INCENTIVE-------- COMPENSATION IS LESS COMPETITIVE. HE ADVISED THAT THE-------- HIGHEST SEPARATION RATES ARE OCCURRING IN THE ACADEMIC-------- AREAS, AND SAID THAT A CONSULTANT HAD QUANTIFIED THE COST-------- OF TURNOVER AT UP TO $68 MILLION ANNUALLY. THE CAUSES OF-------- STANFORD TURNOVER, HE SAID, INCLUDE THE SILICON VALLEY-------- LABOR MARKET, INCOME PRESSURES (COST OF LIVING, HOUSING--------, BETTER PAID OPPORTUNITIES), LACK OF CAREER PROGRESSION--------, AND ISSUES WITH SUPERVISION AND RECOGNITION.----------------------------------------------------- CONTINUING TO SUMMARIZE-------- KEY INFORMATION, CAMMIDGE POINTED OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH-------- THE NUMBER OF STAFF VACANCIES HAD DOUBLED SINCE-------- 1996, STANFORD HAD CONTINUED TO OPERATE WITH A DECENTRALIZED-------- RECRUITMENT PROCESS. HE ALSO NOTED THAT EXISTING-------- SUPPORTIVE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ALWAYS USED, FOR EXAMPLE-------- INCENTIVE PAY, FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING, ACCESS TO RECREATION--------, QUALITY OF WORK LIFE, AND TRANSPORTATION OPPORTUNITIES.-------- SUPPORT IS NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY FOR-------- PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT, HE SAID.-------- HE ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT STANFORD TURNOVER IS INFLUENCED-------- BY BUREAUCRATIC, INEFFICIENT WORK PROCESSES, POORLY-------- DESIGNED OR BORING JOBS, AND JOB COMPLEXITY WITHOUT-------- ADEQUATE TRAINING. THE BOTTOM LINE, ACCORDING TO CAMMIDGE------------- -- "OUR SILICON VALLEY ENVIRONMENT IS A CHALLENGE.-------- NEVERTHELESS, WE CAN DO MORE TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT THE-------- STAFF EMPLOYEES WHO SUPPORT STANFORD'S TEACHING AND-------- RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.----------------------------------------------------------" CAMMIDGE PRESENTED PIE-------- CHARTS SHOWING A TOTAL OF 13,600 STANFORD EMPLOYEES--------, INCLUDING HOURLY AND TEMPORARY WORKERS (BUT EXCLUDING THE-------- HOSPITALS). OF THAT NUMBER, 6,2-- ARE IN ONGOING STAFF-------- POSITIONS (EXCLUDING SLAC, FOR WHICH HE DID NOT HAVE DATA-------- BUT FOR WHICH HE SAID THE RECRUITMENT AND-RETENTION-------- PROBLEMS WERE VERY SIMILAR). HE SHOWED SEPARATION RATES-------- FOR STANFORD'S 15 SCHOOLS AND ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS,---------SPECULATING THAT THE HIGHEST SEPARATION RATES WERE IN THE-------- ACADEMIC AREAS----- "NOT BECAUSE OF THE FACULTY-------------," BUT BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGE OF LOWER LEVEL, PRIMARILY-------- ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF POSITIONS IS HIGHER THERE. CAMMIDGE-------- SAID THAT STANFORD'S INTERNAL MOVEMENT RATE OF ONLY-------- 7% SHOULD BE MUCH HIGHER -- PEOPLE ADVANCING AND BUILDING-------- CAREERS AT THE UNIVERSITY -- AND THAT EVERYONE WOULD OF-------- COURSE LIKE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER THAN 25% LEAVING-------- STANFORD. DATA ALSO SHOW THAT THE LOWER THE SALARY, THE-------- HIGHER THE TURNOVER, HE NOTED, REFLECTING COST OF LIVING-------- PRESSURES. CAMMIDGE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT EMPLOYEES WITH-------- THREE TO FIVE YEARS OF UNIVERSITY SERVICE-HAVE THE-------- HIGHEST SEPARATION RATES (34%) AND ATTRIBUTED THIS IN-------- PART TO PAY COMPRESSION. STANFORD MAY PAY TOO MANY PEOPLE-------- CLOSE TO THE AVERAGE WITHOUT DIFFERENTIATING ENOUGH, HE-------- SUGGESTED.----------------------------------------------------- DISCUSSING STAFF BASE-------- SALARY COMPETITIVENESS WITHIN THE BAY AREA JOB MARKET--------, CAMMIDGE SAID THAT STANFORD'S OVERALL POSITION WAS 1.--------1% ABOVE MARKET, AND SHOWED A SLIDE WITH SEVEN JOB FAMILIES-------- ABOVE MARKET, ONE BY ALMOST 10%, AND THREE JOB FAMILIES-------- BELOW MARKET. THE SPECIFIC JOB CATEGORIES WERE NOT-------- LABELED DUE TO CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUES CONCERNING THE-------- SOURCES, CAMMIDGE SAID. IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS FROM-------- EDUCATION DEAN STIPEK AND PROFESSOR SATZ (PHILOSOPHY), HE-------- INDICATED THAT HIGHER SEPARATION RATES WERE NOT-------- NECESSARILY CORRELATED WITH BELOW MARKET SALARY RATES--------, AND REITERATED HIS CONCERN THAT RELATIVELY UNIFORM SALARY-------- ADMINISTRATION WAS CAUSING STANFORD TO LOSE ITS BEST-------- PEOPLE. CAMMIDGE PRESENTED DATA ON THE NUMBER OF OPEN-------- POSITIONS -- 638 IN AUGUST 2000, ALMOST DOUBLE THE NUMBER-------- FOUR YEARS EARLIER -- AND INDICATED THAT----- "THERE ARE-------- MORE JOB VACANCIES, IT IS TAKING LONGER TO FILL THEM--------, THERE ARE FEWER CANDIDATES, AND IN SOME CASES IT IS-------- DIFFICULT TO FIND QUALIFIED CANDIDATES.-----" HE ALSO-------- SHOWED A SLIDE LISTING THE FACTORS CITED BY ABOUT-------- 350 PEOPLE IN A FALL 1999 SURVEY ASKING WHY THEY JOINED-------- STANFORD, STAYED AT STANFORD, AND LEFT STANFORD.----------------------------------------------------- MOVING BEYOND THE DATA-------- TO ASK----- "WHAT LIES AHEAD?-----" CAMMIDGE DESCRIBED A-------- STRATEGIC VISION OF STANFORD AS AN----- "EMPLOYER OF-------- CHOICE-----" FOR STAFF.----- "ANYTHING THAT TOUCHES ON-------- THE STAFF EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP OUGHT TO BE OF CONCERN TO-------- HUMAN RESOURCES,-----" HE STATED. ASSUMING THAT ALL OF-------- THE BASIC PERSONNEL FUNCTIONS MUST BE WELL EXECUTED, HE-------- IDENTIFIED AREAS IN WHICH STANFORD MIGHT STRIVE TO-------- DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF EXTERNALLY -- QUALITY OF THE WORK-------- ENVIRONMENT, LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES, HOUSING ASSISTANCE-------- OPPORTUNITIES, AND WORK/LIFE CYCLE PROGRAMS -- AS WELL AS-------- AREAS OF INTERNAL DIFFERENTIATION -- CAREER-------- OPPORTUNITIES/TALENT MANAGEMENT/MEANINGFUL WORK--------, COMPETITIVE TOTAL COMPENSATION, MANAGEMENT AND-------- SUPERVISORY LEADERSHIP (INCLUDING FACULTY), AND THE-------- STANFORD COMMUNITY/DIVERSITY. LOOKING AHEAD 12 TO-------- 18 MONTHS, CAMMIDGE EXPRESSED OPTIMISM ABOUT INSTITUTIONAL-------- SPONSORSHIP TO SUPPORT A SERIES OF PRIORITIZED PROJECTS-------- INVOLVING HUMAN RESOURCES AND USER REPRESENTATIVES AS-------- WELL AS IMPROVED HR SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT, ALL GEARED-------- TOWARD----- "GETTING THE RIGHT STAFF, TREATING THEM WELL--------, AND KEEPING THEM.-----" HE MENTIONED SEVERAL ITEMS FROM A-------- LIST OF PRIORITY PROJECTS WITH SPONSORSHIP, INCLUDING A-------- REVIEW OF STAFF HOUSING NEEDS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS-------- (LOOKING AT THE STANFORD WEST APARTMENTS, AND PERHAPS A-------- 403(B) LOAN PRODUCT); A NEW EMPLOYEE REFERRAL PROGRAM-------- PATTERNED AFTER VERY SUCCESSFUL SILICON VALLEY PROGRAMS;-------- AND AN ONGOING STUDY OF CHILDCARE AFFORDABILITY-------- SCHOLARSHIPS.----------------------------------------------------- CAMMIDGE DISCUSSED-------- SEVERAL ADDITIONAL ITEMS FROM A LIST OF POTENTIAL-------- PRIORITY PROJECTS. HE ASKED FOR FACULTY FEEDBACK ABOUT-------- THE FEASIBILITY OF INCREASING MEANINGFUL WORK BY-------- REVIEWING WORK PROCESSES, JOB DESIGN, DELEGATED-------- AUTHORITIES, AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES WITHIN SCHOOLS-------- AND DEPARTMENTS. HE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THE-------- DECENTRALIZATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT FUNCTION IN THE EARLY-------- 1990S SHOULD BE REVISITED, IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A STANFORD------------- "EMPLOYMENT BRAND-----" AND TO PROVIDE CENTRAL-------- RECRUITMENT SUPPORT FOR HARD TO FILL JOBS. FINALLY, HE-------- ASKED WHETHER THE FACULTY WANTED TO BE INVOLVED IN-THE-------- SOLUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, HE WONDERED IF THE-FACULTY STAFF-------- BENEFITS COMMITTEE SHOULD BE BROADENED TO INCLUDE ALL-------- HUMAN RESOURCES ISSUES.----- "THE BASIC MESSAGE FOR ME IS-------- REALLY AN INVITATION TO YOU TO BECOME A 'STAKEHOLDER' IN-------- THE WELL-BEING OF STANFORD'S 6,500 STAFF MEMBERS-------------," CAMMIDGE CONCLUDED.----------------------------------------------------- PROFESSOR ZOBACK-------- (GEOPHYSICS) SUGGESTED THAT RECONSIDERATION OF THE RECENT-------- REDUCTION IN THE CHILD TUITION GRANT BENEFIT, WHICH HE-------- THOUGHT HAD SAVED THE UNIVERSITY ONE OR TWO MILLION-------- DOLLARS PER YEAR, MIGHT MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN THE-------- 25% RATE AND THE $68 MILLION COST OF TURNOVER. CAMMIDGE-------- AGREED THAT EDUCATION AND TRAINING BENEFITS IN GENERAL-------- SHOULD BE EVALUATED, INCLUDING THAT ITEM AS WELL AS THE-------- NEW AND UNDERUTILIZED PROGRAM TO REIMBURSE STAFF MEMBERS-------- THEMSELVES FOR COLLEGE TUITION. ANY SUCH PROGRAMS THAT-------- CAN BE DESIGNED TO BENEFIT EMPLOYEES DIRECTLY, BEFORE-------- TAXES, ARE VERY VALUABLE, HE SAID.----------------------------------------------------- PROFESSOR NOLL-------- (ECONOMICS) COMMENTED THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT-------- CHANGES IN STANFORD SALARIES AND BENEFITS OVER THE PAST-------- TEN YEARS WERE ANYWHERE NEAR AS IMPORTANT AS TWO OTHER-------- MAJOR CHANGES: INCREASED ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY-------- (DUE TO THE INDIRECT COST CONTROVERSY) AND-------- COMPUTERIZATION.----- "THERE IS INFINITELY GREATER-------- ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO, WHICH MEANS THERE'S-------- A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. AND, SECONDLY, COMPUTERIZATION HAS-------- BEEN USED AS A MECHANISM TO DECENTRALIZE THE COST OF-------- UNDERTAKING THAT ACTIVITY FROM THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION---------TO THE ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH UNITS. THE PROPORTION OF THE-------- WORK THAT'S DONE LOCALLY HAS BEEN INCREASED WITH NO-------- CHANGE IN CLASSIFICATION LEVEL AND NO CHANGE IN THE-------- NUMBER OF STAFF. AS A RESULT, THE AMOUNT OF TIME HAS GONE-------- WAY UP THAT DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF SPEND PROVING-------- THEY'RE NOT CRIMINALS OR SATISFYING SOME DISTANT PERSON-------- THAT THEY NEVER CAN TALK TO BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE VOICE-------- MAIL. AND IF YOU JUST TALK TO THESE PEOPLE, THEY'LL TELL-------- YOU THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T LIKE THEIR JOBS.-----" THE-------- FACULTY IN DEPARTMENTS ALSO FEELS THESE THINGS, E.G.--------, TRYING TO GET REIMBURSED FOR TRAVEL OR TO SPEND THEIR-------- GRANT MONEY, NOLL SAID, BUT THEY HAVE NO REAL WAY TO-------- JUDGE HOW MUCH OF-THE INCREASING COMPLEXITY IS ABSOLUTELY-------- REQUIRED, OR HOW MUCH MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVERREACTING TO-------- EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES. H---- & S DEAN BEASLEY SAID THAT-------- HE AGREED TO SOME EXTENT BUT ALSO FELT THAT THE FACULTY-------- COULD PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN REEXAMINING THE-------- ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES IN THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTS AND-------- SCHOOLS. PROFESSOR WOOLEY (ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING) AGREED-------- WITH NOLL THAT STAFF HAD A PARTICULARLY MISERABLE JOB-------- ARRANGING FOR TRAVEL AND REIMBURSEMENT. PRESIDENT-------- HENNESSY CAUTIONED THAT THE FACULTY OFTEN DO NOT READ THE-------- RULES AND THE DIFFICULT TASK OF TELLING THEM----- "YOU-------- CAN'T DO THIS,-----" FALLS TO THE STAFF.----------------------------------------------------- PROFESSOR TATUM (CIVIL-------- AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING) COMMENTED THAT RULES-------- CONCERNING EQUITY WITH EXISTING EMPLOYEES WERE ONE OF THE-------- MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES IN HIRING NEW PEOPLE.-------- RESPONDING TO WOOLEY, CAMMIDGE INDICATED THAT THE DATA-------- PRESENTED TO SENATE WAS PUBLIC AND COULD BE SHARED WITH-------- DEPARTMENT STAFF. HE SAID THAT HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO-------- COME TO DEPARTMENTS TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES, AND SENATE-------- CHAIR OSGOOD ENCOURAGED HIM TO DO SO. OSGOOD THANKED-------- CAMMIDGE FOR A THOUGHTFUL PRESENTATION.----------------------------------------------------- OBTAINING A MOTION AND A-------- SECOND, OSGOOD DECLARED THE SENATE MEETING ADJOURNED AT-------- 5:13 P.M.------------------------------------------------------------------- RESPECTFULLY-------- SUBMITTED,------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SUSAN W.-------- SCHOFIELD------------------------------------------------------------------- ACADEMIC-------- SECRETARY TO THE UNIVERSITY---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
