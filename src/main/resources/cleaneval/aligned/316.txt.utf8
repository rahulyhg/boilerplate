WE ARE ALL SO HAPPY THAT YOU CHOSE-TO HELP A CHESSIE IN-NEED AND WERE WILLING TO OPEN YOUR---- HOME AND HEARTS TO THIS BROWN DOG-------------------------------------------------------! THE THEME OF THIS INFORMATION PACKET IS-------- "SET YOUR DOG---- UP TO SUCCEED---------!" BY UNDERSTANDING YOUR NEW DOG'S BEHAVIOR - YOU CAN ANTICIPATE---- PROBLEMS AND CORRECT THEM CALMLY AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BE REASONABLE IN YOUR---- EXPECTATIONS. WE WANT THE ADOPTION OF YOUR CHESSIE TO BE A----- "WIN-WIN-----" SITUATION---- ON BOTH SIDES------------------------------------------------------------! BEFORE YOU PICK UP YOUR NEW CHESAPEAKE BAY RETRIEVER---------------- SINCE YOU'VE CHOSEN TO ADOPT A CHESAPEAKE BAY RETRIEVER, YOU'VE PROBABLY EDUCATED YOURSELF---- ABOUT 1) THE------------------------- REASONS THIS BREED IS--- UNIQUE-------- (AMERICAN BRED---- RETRIEVER, NOT RELATED TO GOLDENS AND LABRADORS), 2) THE BREED'S-------------------------- BEHAVIOR---- CHARACTERISTICS-------- (INTENSELY LOYAL, PROTECTIVE, SENSITIVE AND SERIOUS) AND 3)--- CHANGES-------- TO YOUR CURRENT LIFESTYLE THAT THIS CHESSIE WILL CAUSE (TIME SET ASIDE DAILY FOR EXERCISE---- AND--- WORK----, EITHER OBEDIENCE OR RETRIEVING). THE CHESAPEAKE BAY RETRIEVER RELIEF-------- & RESCUE WEBSITE (--------------------------------------WWW.CBRRESCUE.ORG--------) HAS---- INFORMATION ABOUT THE UNIQUENESS OF THIS BREED, CHESSIE BEHAVIOR AND DOG OWNERSHIP THAT---- YOU MIGHT WANT TO READ AND REVIEW.------------------------------------------------------ THE ADOPTION COORDINATOR THAT YOU WORKED WITH TOLD YOU ABOUT---- YOUR CHESSIE'S HISTORY, VETERINARY INFORMATION, EVALUATIONS AND CURRENT EATING,-SLEEPING---- AND ACTIVITY ROUTINES SO THAT HIS TRANSITION INTO YOUR HOME CAN BE EASIER. DOGS NEED ORDER---- AND ARE EXTREMELY--- ROUTINE ORIENTED----. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU FIND OUT ALL YOU CAN---- ABOUT HIS ROUTINE - AND DUPLICATE WHAT YOU CAN--- - BEFORE---- YOU START TO RE-ORIENT HIM---- TO THE RHYTHMS AND SCHEDULES OF YOUR HOME. WORK OUT YOUR--- HOUSE RULES---- AND DOG-CARE---- REGIMEN IN ADVANCE AMONG THE HUMAN MEMBERS OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD. WHO WILL WALK THE DOG FIRST---- THING IN THE MORNING? WHO WILL FEED HIM AT NIGHT? WILL CHESSIE BE ALLOWED ON THE COUCH OR---- BED? WHERE WILL HE SLEEP AT NIGHT? WILL HE BE CRATED?------------------------------------------------------ TO ENSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION, YOU WILL ALREADY HAVE--- SUPPLIES-------- (COLLAR, ID TAG, LEASH, FOOD, BOWLS, CRATE AND TOYS) FOR YOUR CHESSIE.------------------------------------------------------- TRY AND ARRANGE THE ARRIVAL OF YOUR NEW DOG FOR A WEEKEND---- - OR WHEN YOU CAN BE HOME FOR A FEW DAYS - FOR--- QUALITY, HANDS-ON TIME----.------------------------------------------------------- IF YOU HAVE--- RESIDENT PETS----, MAKE SURE THEY ARE---- UP-TO-DATE ON THEIR SHOTS AND IN GENERAL GOOD HEALTH BEFORE BRINGING HOME YOUR NEW DOG.---- DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF THE RESCUE ORGANIZATION- PREVIOUS OWNER OR FOSTER FAMILY----, VIRUSES CAN BE SPREAD AND OCCASIONALLY GO HOME WITH ADOPTED RESCUE DOGS. YOU MAY WISH TO---- SET UP AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR OWN VET TO CHECK OUT YOUR NEW DOG AND SET UP AN-----INOCULATION SCHEDULE, DEPENDING ON THE-VETERINARY CARE YOUR RESCUE DOG HAS RECEIVED.------------------------------------------------------- REGISTER FOR AN--- OBEDIENCE CLASS----. DON'T IGNORE THIS---- VERY IMPORTANT STEP IN SETTING YOURSELF AND YOUR RESCUED-CHESSIE UP FOR SUCCESS! BE DOGGED---- ABOUT FINDING AN OBEDIENCE CLASS OR TRAINER. THERE ARE MANY POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT-BASED---- DOG OBEDIENCE CLASSES THAT TEACH DOG MANNERS, CANINE GOOD CITIZENSHIP AND DISCIPLINE. TRY---- TO-REGISTER FOR A CLASS-STARTING ABOUT 3 TO 4 WEEKS-------- AFTER--------- YOUR DOG HAS---- COME HOME WITH YOU. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOUR NEW DOG HAS SOME TIME TO ADJUST TO YOU AND---- YOUR HOME---- BEFORE----- PUTTING HIM INTO THE STIMULATING ENVIRONMENT OF AN OBEDIENCE---- CLASS. EVEN THE SHORTEST----- "DOG MANNERS-----" COURSE OFFERED AT YOUR VET'S WILL---- REINFORCE THE NEW BOND BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR NEW CHESSIE, WILL GIVE YOU A VALUABLE---- FACE-TO-FACE RESOURCE FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR DOG'S BEHAVIOR, AND WILL PROVIDE A POWERFUL---- TOOL FOR MODERATING YOUR RESCUE DOG'S LESS ATTRACTIVE BEHAVIOR TRAITS! REMEMBER, CHESSIES---- NEED WORK - THIS IS A REALLY EASY WAY TO PROVIDE HIM WITH ACTIVE, MENTAL WORK THAT YOU'LL---- APPROVE OF! THE REWARDS ARE OBVIOUS - WHAT A JOY IT IS TO HAVE A WELL-MANNERED, TRAINED---- CHESSIE COMPANION------------------------------------------------------! NEW FAMILIES OFTEN ASK ABOUT--- CHANGING THE ADOPTED DOG'S---- NAME----. IF YOU DESIRE TO, IT IS FINE. MANY TIMES, THE DOGS ARE GIVEN NAMES AT RANDOM BY---- A SHELTER. THE DOG WILL LEARN HIS NEW NAME IF IT'S OVERUSED IN THE BEGINNING. IT IS IN NO---- WAY TRAUMATIC TO THE DOG TO CHANGE HIS NAME.------------------------------------------------------------ WHEN YOU ARRIVE HOME...----------------------------------------------------------------------------- THINGS TO EXPECT:--------------------------- YOU SHOULD EXPECT YOUR NEW DOG TO ACT DIFFERENTLY THAN HOW HE DID WHEN YOU MET HIM AT THE---- FOSTER/OWNER'S HOME. HE WILL BE EXCITED, NERVOUS AND MAYBE TIRED AFTER THE TRIP TO YOUR---- HOUSE. BEING ROUTINE-ORIENTED, YOUR CHESSIE MAY HAVE JUST GOTTEN COMFORTABLE AT HIS FOSTER---- HOME AND NOW RECOGNIZES THAT THE ROUTINE IS CHANGING YET AGAIN. HE DOESN'T KNOW THE---- SMELLS, THE SOUNDS, AND IMPORTANTLY, THE ROUTINES AND RULES OF YOUR HOUSE. THIS IS VERY---- CONFUSING FOR YOUR CHESSIE.------------------------------------------------------ DOGS DISPLAY--- ANXIETY AND NERVOUSNESS---- BY: PANTING----, PACING, LACK OF EYE CONTACT,----- "NOT LISTENING,-----" HOUSEBREAKING ACCIDENTS, EXCESSIVE---- CHEWING, GASTRIC UPSET (VOMITING, DIARRHEA, LOOSE STOOLS), CRYING, WHINING, JUMPINESS AND---- BARKING. THIS IS A LITANY OF BEHAVIORS ANY AND EVERY DOG OWNER DREADS! AS LONG AS YOU---- UNDERSTAND WHERE THESE-BEHAVIORS ORIGINATE, YOU CAN PERHAPS ADDRESS THEM--- BEFORE-------- THEY APPEAR AND DEAL EFFECTIVELY WHEN THEY DO! YOUR GOAL IN THE NEXT WEEKS IS TO REDUCE---- THE----- "NOISE---- & CONFUSION IN HIS HEAD-----" AND GET HIM TO RELAX, TO BE CALM AND---- SHOW HIM HOW TO BE GOOD. DESPITE YOUR JOY AT ADOPTING THIS CHESSIE (AND AFTER A FEW---- ENTHUSIASTIC HUGS AND KISSES), YOU SHOULD BE CALM AND GENTLE AND FIRM WITH YOUR CHESSIE.---- TALK TO HIM IN A CALM, LOW VOICE AS YOU TRAVEL HOME - AVOID PLAYING THE CAR RADIO AND---- HAVING TOO MANY PEOPLE WITH YOU WHEN YOU PICK HIM UP.------------------------------------------------------ ALL RESCUE DOGS GO THROUGH A----- "HONEYMOON PERIOD.---------" AFTER THE FIRST DAY OR SO, THE DOG MAY BE VERY QUIET AND EXTRAORDINARILY CONTROLLED AND--------- "GOOD.-----" THE----- "REAL-----" DOG APPEARS TWO TO FOUR WEEKS LATER - AFTER HE'S---- MOSTLY FIGURED OUT THE HOUSE RULES, THE SCHEDULE OF THE DAYS, AND THE CHARACTERS OF HIS---- NEW FAMILY. AT THIS TIME, HE'LL START TESTING OUT HIS POSITION IN THE PACK, AND MAY--------- "REGRESS-----" TO PUPPYHOOD BEHAVIORS AND----- "BAD-----" BEHAVIOR. BE PATIENT WITH---- HIM, FIRM IN YOUR EXPECTATIONS, PRAISE HIM FOR APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR - ESPECIALLY WHEN HE---- IS LYING QUIETLY AND BEHAVING HIMSELF. DON'T PRAISE FOR NOTHING CONSTANTLY - THE DOG WILL---- LEARN TO TUNE OUT YOUR PRAISE OVER TIME---------------------------------------------------------------------! THINGS TO DO:---------------------------------------------------------------------------- LEASH YOUR DOG TO INTRODUCE HIM TO YOUR HOME------------! WHEN YOU--- FIRST---- BRING YOUR NEW DOG HOME, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE HER ON A LEASH! SPEND---- THE FIRST 15-30 MINUTES WALKING HER OUTSIDE AROUND THE PERIMETER OF YOUR YARD OR THE AREA---- THAT YOU WILL BE WITH HER MOST ON YOUR PROPERTY. WALK SLOWLY - LET HER----- "LEAD---------" MOSTLY - AND LET HER SNIFF AND PAUSE IF SHE WANTS TO. SHE IS GETTING USED TO THE----- "LAY---- OF THE LAND-----" AND ALL THE SMELLS ASSOCIATED WITH HER NEW HOME. SHE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY---- RELIEVE HERSELF - THIS IS HER WAY OF MAKING HERSELF AT HOME BY ADDING HER MARK TO THE---- SMELLS OF YOUR HOME, AND NOW HER NEW HOME. OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT THIS TO HAPPEN OUTSIDE! IF---- YOU HAVE A PLACE YOU WISH THIS TO HAPPEN, ENCOURAGE HER TO----- "GET BUSY-----" IN THAT---- AREA AND PRAISE HER WARMLY WHEN SHE DOES. THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOVE AND-NEW FAMILY WILL---- CAUSE HER TO HAVE TO--- RELIEVE HERSELF MORE OFTEN THAN NORMAL----. YOU MUST BE PREPARED---- TO GIVE HER PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THIS IN THE BEGINNING! WHENEVER THE RESCUE DOG---- IS NOT CONFINED, SUPERVISE HER - SET THIS DOG UP TO WIN------------------------------------------------------! YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ISOLATING THE NEW DOG FROM YOUR---- RESIDENT DOGS DURING THE FIRST ENTRY TO YOUR HOME - HE WILL APPRECIATE SAFE AND QUIET AT---- FIRST AS HE EXPLORES YOUR HOME. CRATE YOUR RESIDENT DOG OR HAVE SOMEONE TAKE HIM FOR A---- WALK WHILE YOUR NEW DOG EXPLORES.------------------------------------------------------ LET THE NEW DOG EXPLORE THE HOUSE - LEAVE HER ON LEASH AND---- MAKE SURE SHE'S SUPERVISED AT ALL TIMES! WE RECOMMEND LEAVING YOUR NEW DOG ON LEASH IN THE---- HOUSE FOR THE FIRST DAY. DON'T EVEN LEAVE THE DOG UNSUPERVISED WHILE YOU ANSWER THE PHONE------------------------------------------------------! ONCE INSIDE YOUR HOUSE, A MALE MAY STILL ACCIDENTALLY MARK A---- DOOR, PLANT OR CHAIR WHEN HE FIRST WALKS INSIDE YOUR HOME. THIS IS OUT OF NERVOUSNESS (OR---- HE MAY SMELL ANOTHER DOG), SO IT IS BEST TO LEAVE HIM ON THE LEASH INDOORS THE FIRST DAY.---- IF HE STARTS TO LIFT HIS LEG, GIVE HIM A SHORT JERK ON THE LEASH AND TELL HIM--------- "NO,-----" THAT SHOULD STOP HIM IMMEDIATELY AND REMIND HIM OF HIS HOUSEBREAKING---- MANNERS. FOLLOW UP THIS CORRECTION BY TAKING HIM OUTSIDE IN CASE HE'S NOT JUST MARKING----! BEAR IN MIND THAT IF YOUR CHESSIE HAS A FEW ACCIDENTS, IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT---- HE IS NOT HOUSEBROKEN. WE CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW MUCH NERVES AND EXCITEMENT CAN CAUSE--- UNCHARACTERISTIC---- ACCIDENTS----. WATCH FOR TYPICAL PRE-PIDDLING BEHAVIOR - CIRCLING, SNIFFING, ETC. DO NOT---- SCOLD OR HIT A DOG FOR HAVING AN ACCIDENT - RATHER, VERBALLY GET HIS ATTENTION, GRAB THE---- LEASH, AND TAKE HIM RIGHT OUTSIDE TO HIS SPOT TO DO HIS BUSINESS. IF HE DOES IT, PRAISE---- HIM! ONCE HE RELAXES AND LEARNS THE RHYTHMS AND ROUTINES OF YOUR HOME, ALL HIS MANNERS---- WILL RETURN------------------------------------------------------! EVEN IN A FENCED YARD, YOU'LL WANT TO LEAVE YOUR RESCUED-----CHESSIE ON LEASH FOR-THE FIRST WEEK OR SO. THIS WAY, YOU CAN REINFORCE A RECALL COMMAND---- AND HELP MONITOR PACK BEHAVIOR IF YOU HAVE OTHER DOGS. UNTIL YOUR NEW DOG BONDS TO YOU AND---- MAKES GOOD EYE CONTACT, WE RECOMMEND LEAVING HER ON LEASH.--------------------------------------------------------- PROVIDE QUIET TIME------------! QUIET TIME WILL BE-IMPORTANT FOR YOUR NEW CHESSIE IN THE FIRST WEEK. BECAUSE OF HIS---- NERVOUSNESS AND ANXIETY, HE WILL GET WORN OUT FAST. HIS RECENT PAST MAY INCLUDE A SHELTER-----STAY WHICH HAS WORN HIM OUT WITH WORRY. DESPITE-YOUR EXCITEMENT, TRY AND RESIST INVITING---- FRIENDS AND RELATIVES OVER TO VISIT HIM. GIVE HIM TIME TO GET USED TO YOUR IMMEDIATE---- FAMILY AND RESIDENT PETS ONLY. IF THE DOG DOES NOT SOLICIT PLAY OR ATTENTION FROM YOU, LET---- HIM ALONE TO SLEEP OR ESTABLISH HIMSELF. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WE DON'T WANT YOU TO FORCE HIM---- TO PLAY AT FIRST----------------------------------------------------------! FEED YOUR NEW DOG------------! FEED YOUR NEW DOG TWICE A DAY; HALF IN THE MORNING, HALF AT NIGHT. ASK AND ENCOURAGE THE---- DOG TO SIT BEFORE PUTTING THE BOWL DOWN. PUT THE FOOD BOWL DOWN FOR 15 MINUTES. IF THE DOG---- DOES NOT EAT HER FOOD, PICK UP THE BOWL UNTIL THE NEXT MEALTIME. AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS OF---- THIS ROUTING, EVEN THE MOST FINICKY OF EATERS WILL CHANGE THEIR MINDS. FEEDING THIS WAY---- YOU CAN MONITOR EXACTLY HOW MUCH SHE IS EATING.------------------------------------------------------ IF YOU HAVE--- OTHER DOGS----, FEED YOUR RESCUE DOG AWAY FROM---- THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME. YOU CAN FEED IN THE SAME ROOM, BUT USE OPPOSITE CORNERS, ----PUTTING THE DOMINANT DOG'S BOWL DOWN FIRST. THIS IS USUALLY THE RESIDENT DOG ON THE FIRST---- FEW NIGHTS - BUT THAT SITUATION MAY CHANGE OVER TIME! YOU MAY WANT TO ARRANGE HAVING---- ANOTHER ADULT IN THE ROOM FOR THE FIRST WEEK OF FEEDINGS TO MONITOR THE ------PACK---- BEHAVIOR.-----" WATCH THAT EACH DOG STICKS TO HIS OWN BOWL. KEEP VIGILANT OVER FEEDING---- TIME FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS UNTIL THE PACK POSITIONS ARE WORKED OUT.--------------------------------------------------------- CONSIDER CRATING YOUR DOG------------! MANY OF THE CHESSIES THAT PASS THROUGH RESCUE HAVE BEEN CRATE TRAINED AT ONE TIME OR---- ANOTHER. EVERY DOG NEEDS A PLACE TO ESCAPE TO, A PLACE TO CALL HIS OWN, AND A CRATE---- PROVIDES AN ANSWER TO THESE NEEDS! YOUR NEW CHESSIE WILL HAVE SOME DEGREE OF SEPARATION---- ANXIETY WHEN YOU LEAVE HIM FOR WORK OR ALONE AT HOME. CRATING THE DOG IN THE BEGINNING---- WILL ELIMINATE ACCIDENTS, CHEWING DESTRUCTION, AND OTHER MISCHIEVOUS ACTIVITY THAT IS---- ROOTED IN NERVOUSNESS AND INSECURITY. YOUR DOG IS SAFEST IN THE CRATE WHEN YOU ARE NOT---- HOME UNTIL YOU CAN TOTALLY TRUST HIM LOOSE IN THE HOUSE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IF YOU---- HAVE RESIDENT PETS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SUPERVISE THEIR INTERACTIONS WHEN YOU'RE AWAY OR---- ASLEEP! CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LEAVE THE DOG ALONE IF HE RETREATS TO HIS CRATE. YOU---- SHOULD NEVER USE THE CRATE FOR DISCIPLINING. THE CRATE MUST BE A DOG'S SANCTUARY FOR CRATE---- TRAINING TO BE EFFECTIVE. CRATES ARE GREAT FOR TRAVELING WITH YOUR DOG LATER - THE DOG---- WILL ALWAYS HAVE A FAMILIAR DEN TO RETREAT TO AND FEEL COMFORTABLE AND REASSURED.------------------------------------------------------ EACH TIME YOUR DOG IS CONFINED, MAKE SURE THE DOG KNOWS SHE'S---- A GOOD GIRL. IF THE CHESSIE IS PARTICULARLY EMOTIONAL OR ANXIOUS, TRY MAKING GOOD BYES AND---- HELLOS AS UNEMOTIONAL---- & NONCHALANT AS POSSIBLE.------------------------------------------------------- WHILE CRATING A DOG HELPS MAKE EVERYBODY SAFE, CRATING SHOULD---- NOT BE ABUSED BY LOCKING THE DOG IN THE CRATE ALL THE TIME. CHESSIES NEED TO BE WITH YOU---- AND SHOULD BE WITH YOU UNLESS THEY CANNOT BE SUPERVISED OR TRUSTED ALONE IN THE HOUSE. FOR---- INSTANCE, IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOWER AND THE DOG STILL SOMETIMES CHEWS, CRATE HIM FOR---- THOSE 15 MINUTES FOR SAFETY, BUT THEN LET HIM OUT TO BE WITH YOU. IF THE DOG IS CRATED---- WHILE YOU ARE WORK ALL DAY - YOU MUST MAKE AN EXTRA EFFORT TO LET THE DOG----- "HANG---------" WITH YOU IN THE HOUSE UNTIL HE IS RELIABLE LOOSE IN THE HOUSE.------------------------------------------------------ IF YOU PREFER NOT TO CRATE, MAKE SURE TO SET ASIDE A SAFE----, INDESTRUCTIBLE SPACE IN YOUR HOME FOR YOUR RESCUE DOG. YOU MAY WANT TO TRY USING BABY---- GATES IN THE KITCHEN OR HALLWAY. REMEMBER, YOU MAY REALLY WANT TO KEEP YOUR DOG ON EASY---- CLEANUP FLOORING AT FIRST!! IF THE AREA OF CONFINEMENT IS TOO LARGE, YOU MAY BEGIN TO HAVE---- HOUSEBREAKING ACCIDENTS. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THE BASEMENT OR GARAGE, SINCE YOUR DOG WILL---- NOT FEEL----- "PART OF THE FAMILY-----" ISOLATED AWAY FROM IT. IF HE CAN SEE AND HEAR YOU----, MUCH THE BETTER. THIS IS WHY WIRE STYLE CRATES ARE SO EFFECTIVE IN THE HOUSE.--------------------------------------------------------- BE PATIENT DURING THE HONEYMOON PERIOD------------! THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT YOUR RESCUED CHESSIE WILL SHOW HIS INSECURITY BY FOLLOWING YOU---- EVERYWHERE! THIS WILL INCLUDE TRYING TO HANG WITH YOU IN THE BATHROOM, WATCHING TV WITH---- YOU, GETTING THE MAIL, AND UNDOUBTEDLY WANTING TO SLEEP WITH YOU. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR---- HIM TO WHINE OR CRY OR BARK IF CONFINED AWAY FROM YOU AT NIGHT - LIGHTS OUT AT A NEW---- STRANGE PLACE IS A STRESSFUL THING FOR HIM. IF YOU PUT THE CRATE CLOSE TO YOUR BEDROOM OR---- SOMEWHERE HE CAN SEE YOU, THE PROBLEMS ARE USUALLY MINIMIZED. SAFE CHEW TOYS IN THE CRATE---- AT NIGHT WILL GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DO IF HE'S AWAKE. REMEMBER, DURING THE FIRST COUPLE OF---- WEEKS, THE DOG WILL PROBABLY GET QUITE TIRED AND WORN OUT BY THE DAY'S ACTIVITIES, SO---- ESTABLISHING A SLEEP SCHEDULE IS USUALLY NOT A BIG DEAL. AS YOU WEAN HIM FROM THE CRATING---- AT NIGHT, MAKE SURE HE HAS BEEN WELL EXERCISED - A TIRED CHESSIE IS USUALLY A REALLY GOOD---- CHESSIE INDOORS---------------------------------------------------------!! ESTABLISH A ROUTINE------------! TRY TO DEVELOP--- AND USE---- A CONSISTENT DAILY ROUTINE FOR FEEDING, EXERCISING, AND---- BATHROOM DUTIES. DOGS ARE CREATURES OF HABIT AND ROUTINE TRANSLATES INTO SECURITY FOR---- THEM. IF YOU DO THE SAME THINGS IN THE SAME WAY AND IN THE SAME ORDER, HE WILL SETTLE IN---- MORE QUICKLY AND LEARN WHAT IS EXPECTED OF HIM AND WHEN.------------------------------------------------------ LET YOUR NEW CHESSIE OUT TO AIR AND TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS AS---- SOON AS YOU RISE IN THE MORNINGS. FEED HIM AFTER A SHORT WALK OR ROMP IN THE YARD. GIVE---- HIM ANOTHER CHANCE TO RELIEVE HIMSELF BEFORE YOU GO TO WORK. UPON RETURN FROM WORK----, IMMEDIATELY LET THE DOG OUT FOR EXERCISE AND BATHROOM BREAK (THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO READ---- THE MAIL, MAKE A PHONE CALL OR FLOP YOURSELF ON THE SOFA!!!). IF HE'S EXERCISED HEAVILY----, WAIT 30 MINUTES OR SO BEFORE THE EVENING FEEDING. HE'LL NEED ANOTHER BATHROOM BREAK---- ANYWHERE FROM 30 MINUTES TO SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THE EVENING MEAL, DEPENDING ON HIS AGE---- - IT'LL BE YOUR JOB TO FIGURE THIS OUT. HE SHOULD GET ANOTHER AIRING RIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO---- BED.--------------------------------------------------------- SOCIALIZE YOUR RESCUED CHESSIE------------! RESCUE DOGS COME FROM A VARIETY OF BACKGROUNDS, BUT ALL DOGS CAN DO WITH MORE---- SOCIALIZATION. AFTER YOUR DOG HAS TIME TO SETTLE IN YOUR HOME AND IS STARTING TO LOOK TO---- YOU WITH CONFIDENCE (2-3 WEEKS), START PROVIDING NEW SOCIALIZATION OPPORTUNITIES.------------------------------------------------------- NOW YOU CAN START INVITING YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES OVER.---- DO INTRODUCTIONS TO NEW PEOPLE GRADUALLY. INTRODUCTIONS CAN TAKE THE FORM OF PETTING----, PLAYING FETCH, EVEN GOING FOR A WALK.--- DO NOT FORCE THE DOG TO ACCEPT NEW PEOPLE-------- - DO IT POSITIVELY, WITH LOTS OF PRAISE, ALLOWING THE DOG TO APPROACH PEOPLE RATHER THAN NEW---- PEOPLE APPROACHING YOUR DOG!!! BE SURE TO TELL YOUR VISITORS THAT YOUR DOG IS NEW FROM---- RESCUE SO THEY NEED TO BE MORE SENSITIVE. DON'T REACH FOR THE DOG RIGHT AWAY - LET HIM---- COME TO THEM. IF HE DOES NOT GO TO THE NEW PERSON, THAT VISITOR SHOULD COMPLETELY IGNORE---- THE DOG. SUGGEST AFTER THE DOG HAS MET/SNIFFED THE NEW PERSON THAT THEY PAT THE SIDE OF---- THE DOG'S NECK OR SIDE OF THE SHOULDER INSTEAD. PATTING A DOG ON THE TOP OF THE HEAD IS---- INTERPRETED BY DOGS AS A POWERFUL DOMINANCE ATTEMPT AND CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO SOME DOGS, A---- FRIGHTENING THING TO OTHERS.------------------------------------------------------ START TAKING YOUR DOG NEW PLACES - NEARBY PARKS, DOG-ALLOWED---- BEACHES - AND, ESPECIALLY TO OBEDIENCE CLASSES! THE OPPORTUNITY WILL ALLOW YOU TO---- DETERMINE HOW YOUR DOG RESPONDS TO STRANGE PEOPLE, DOGS AND PLACES.--------------------------------------------------------- LOVE AND ENJOY YOUR NEW DOG----------------------------------------------------------------AUTHORITY WITHOUT DOMINATION.---------LOVE WITHOUT SUBSERVIENCE.-------- RESPECT WITHOUT FEAR.------------------------------------------------------------------ THIS IS AN ADAGE USED BY WORKERS IN GSD RESCUE. IT IS---- APPROPRIATE FOR RESCUED CHESSIES, TOO, AND WE'D LIKE PEOPLE TO-THINK ABOUT IT AS THEY LIVE---- WITH AND TRAIN THEIR RESCUE DOGS. YOU DO NOT NEED TO FRIGHTEN YOU DOG INTO COMPLYING WITH---- HOUSEHOLD OBEDIENCE COMMANDS, OR PROVE TO HIM-THAT YOU ARE THE TOUGHEST CREATURE AROUND BY---- USING CONSTANT BRUTE FORCE. YOU DO NEED TO SHOW YOUR DOG THAT YOU ARE THE LEADER IN THE---- HOUSEHOLD, A LEADER HE SHOULD PUT HIS TRUST IN-FOLLOWING. YOU CAN DO THIS BY--------- "TELLING-----" YOUR DOG THIS IN A LANGUAGE HE UNDERSTANDS - BODY LANGUAGE AND DAILY---- HABITS. RESPECT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN FORCE A CREATURE INTO GIVING YOU.------------------------------------------------------- ABOVE ALL, BE PATIENT, FIRM AND CONSISTENT WITH YOUR NEW---- CHESSIE. USE POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT AND LOTS OF PRAISE WHEN SHE'S GOOD. WHEN MISTAKES ARE ----MADE, CORRECT HER WHEN IT'S-HAPPENING, AND PRAISE HER WHEN SHE MODIFIES HER BEHAVIOR.---- UNDOUBTEDLY YOU WILL GET LOTS OF ADVICE - GOOD AND BAD - FROM OTHER DOG OWNERS! READ AND---- RESEARCH AS MUCH AS YOU CAN TO PREPARE YOURSELF. UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES YOU MAY NEED TO---- TRY MORE THAN ONE APPROACH TO A PROBLEM BECAUSE EVERY CHESSIE IS DIFFERENT. MOST RESCUE---- AND ADOPTION COORDINATORS WILL FOLLOW-UP ON THE DOGS THEY PLACE. MOST RESCUERS ARE BACKED---- UP BY DOG BEHAVIOR AND HEALTH EXPERTS WITHIN THEIR OWN LOCAL ORGANIZATION, SO IF THEY---- DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO A PROBLEM, THEY CAN ASK OTHERS. DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS, ----BRING UP NEW SITUATIONS, AND-FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION THAT YOU MAY HAVE! OUR GOAL IS TO---- MAKE SURE RESCUE DOGS NEVER HAVE TO BE UPROOTED AGAIN, SO WE ARE QUITE INTERESTED IN---- HELPING YOU TROUBLESHOOT ANY PROBLEMS - THE SOONER THE BETTER BEFORE THEY BECOME BIG---- PROBLEMS THAT THREATEN THE PLACEMENT------------------------------------------------------! MOST OF ALL, BE PREPARED TO-GIVE AND RECEIVE MORE LOVE----, AFFECTION-AND LOYALTY THAN YOU-EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE! ENJOY YOUR BROWN DOG FOR MANY YEARS---- TO COME AND THANKS AGAIN FOR HELPING US RESCUE CHESSIES---------------------------------------------------------! - CREDIT FOR MANY OF THESE TIPS IS DUE TO GERMAN SHEPHERD---- DOG RESCUE OF NEW ENGLAND, INC., LABRADOR RETRIEVER RESCUE, INC., AND THE AMERICAN KENNEL---- CLUB.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
