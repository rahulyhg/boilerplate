BUT THIS IS NOT VERY HELPFUL--------, FOR THE SAME MAY BE SAID ABOUT ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THE-------- FIELD OF MODERN HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT.------------------------- AS A DISTINCT AND FORMAL MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE USED IN THE-------- EVALUATION OF WORK PERFORMANCE, APPRAISAL REALLY DATES-------- FROM THE TIME OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR - NOT MORE THAN-------- 60 YEARS AGO.------------------------- YET IN A BROADER SENSE, THE PRACTICE OF-------- APPRAISAL IS A VERY ANCIENT ART. IN THE SCALE OF THINGS-------- HISTORICAL, IT MIGHT WELL LAY CLAIM TO BEING THE WORLD'S-------- SECOND OLDEST PROFESSION---------------------------! THERE IS, SAYS----------------------- DULEWICZ (1989),----------------- "... A BASIC HUMAN-------- TENDENCY TO MAKE JUDGEMENTS ABOUT THOSE ONE IS WORKING-------- WITH, AS WELL AS ABOUT ONESELF.-----" APPRAISAL, IT-------- SEEMS, IS BOTH INEVITABLE AND UNIVERSAL. IN THE-------- ABSENCE OF A CAREFULLY STRUCTURED SYSTEM OF APPRAISAL--------, PEOPLE WILL TEND TO JUDGE THE WORK PERFORMANCE OF OTHERS, INCLUDING SUBORDINATES----------, NATURALLY, INFORMALLY AND ARBITRARILY.------------------------------------------------------ THE HUMAN INCLINATION TO JUDGE CAN CREATE SERIOUS-------- MOTIVATIONAL, ETHICAL AND LEGAL PROBLEMS IN THE-------- WORKPLACE. WITHOUT A STRUCTURED APPRAISAL SYSTEM, THERE-------- IS LITTLE CHANCE OF ENSURING THAT THE JUDGEMENTS MADE---------WILL BE LAWFUL, FAIR--DEFENSIBLE AND ACCURATE.------------------------- PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL SYSTEMS-BEGAN AS SIMPLE METHODS OF-------- INCOME JUSTIFICATION. THAT IS, APPRAISAL WAS USED TO-------- DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THE SALARY OR WAGE OF AN INDIVIDUAL-------- EMPLOYEE WAS JUSTIFIED.---------------------------------------------------------- THE-------- PROCESS WAS FIRMLY LINKED TO MATERIAL OUTCOMES. IF AN-------- EMPLOYEE'S PERFORMANCE WAS FOUND TO-BE LESS THAN IDEAL, A-------- CUT IN PAY WOULD FOLLOW. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THEIR-------- PERFORMANCE WAS BETTER THAN THE SUPERVISOR EXPECTED, A-------- PAY RISE WAS IN ORDER.---------------------------------------------------------- LITTLE-------- CONSIDERATION, IF ANY, WAS GIVEN TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL-------- POSSIBILITIES OF APPRAISAL. IF WAS FELT THAT A CUT IN-------- PAY- OR A RISE, SHOULD PROVIDE THE ONLY REQUIRED IMPETUS-------- FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO EITHER IMPROVE OR CONTINUE TO PERFORM-------- WELL.-------------------------- SOMETIMES THIS BASIC SYSTEM SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE-------- RESULTS THAT WERE INTENDED; BUT MORE OFTEN THAN-NOT, IT-------- FAILED.---------------------------------------------------------- FOR-------- EXAMPLE, EARLY MOTIVATIONAL RESEARCHERS WERE AWARE THAT-------- DIFFERENT-PEOPLE WITH ROUGHLY EQUAL WORK ABILITIES COULD-------- BE PAID THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AND YET HAVE QUITE-------- DIFFERENT LEVELS OF MOTIVATION AND PERFORMANCE.------------------------- THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE-CONFIRMED IN EMPIRICAL STUDIES.---------PAY RATES WERE IMPORTANT, YES; BUT THEY WERE NOT-THE ONLY-------- ELEMENT THAT HAD AN IMPACT ON EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE. IT-------- WAS FOUND THAT OTHER ISSUES, SUCH AS MORALE-AND-------- SELF-ESTEEM, COULD ALSO HAVE A MAJOR INFLUENCE.---------------------------------------------------------- AS-------- A RESULT--THE TRADITIONAL EMPHASIS ON REWARD OUTCOMES WAS-------- PROGRESSIVELY REJECTED. IN THE-1950S IN THE UNITED --------STATES- THE POTENTIAL USEFULNESS OF APPRAISAL AS TOOL FOR-------- MOTIVATION AND DEVELOPMENT WAS GRADUALLY RECOGNIZED. THE-------- GENERAL-MODEL OF PERFORMANCE-APPRAISAL, AS IT IS KNOWN-------- TODAY, BEGAN FROM THAT TIME.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MODERN-------- APPRAISAL----------------- PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL MAY-------- BE DEFINED AS A STRUCTURED FORMAL INTERACTION BETWEEN A --------SUBORDINATE AND SUPERVISOR, THAT USUALLY TAKES THE FORM-------- OF A PERIODIC INTERVIEW (ANNUAL OR SEMI-ANNUAL), IN WHICH-------- THE WORK PERFORMANCE OF THE SUBORDINATE IS EXAMINED AND-------- DISCUSSED, WITH A VIEW TO IDENTIFYING WEAKNESSES AND-------- STRENGTHS AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT AND-------- SKILLS DEVELOPMENT.---------------------------------------------------------- IN-------- MANY ORGANIZATIONS - BUT NOT ALL - APPRAISAL RESULTS ARE-------- USED, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO HELP DETERMINE-------- REWARD OUTCOMES. THAT IS, THE APPRAISAL RESULTS ARE USED-------- TO IDENTIFY THE BETTER PERFORMING EMPLOYEES WHO SHOULD-------- GET THE MAJORITY OF AVAILABLE MERIT PAY INCREASES--------, BONUSES, AND PROMOTIONS.------------------------- BY THE SAME TOKEN, APPRAISAL RESULTS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY-------- THE POORER PERFORMERS WHO MAY REQUIRE SOME FORM OF COUNSELING, OR IN EXTREME CASES, DEMOTION, DISMISSAL OR-------- DECREASES IN PAY. (ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO BE AWARE OF LAWS-------- IN THEIR COUNTRY THAT MIGHT RESTRICT THEIR CAPACITY TO-------- DISMISS EMPLOYEES OR DECREASE PAY.-------------------------) WHETHER THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF PERFORMANCE-------- APPRAISAL - THE ASSIGNMENT AND JUSTIFICATION OF REWARDS --------AND PENALTIES - IS A VERY UNCERTAIN AND CONTENTIOUS-------- MATTER.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONTROVERSY--------, CONTROVERSY---------------- FEW ISSUES IN MANAGEMENT-------- STIR UP MORE CONTROVERSY THAN PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL.------------------------- THERE ARE MANY REPUTABLE SOURCES - RESEARCHERS--------, MANAGEMENT COMMENTATORS, PSYCHOMETRICIANS - WHO HAVE-------- EXPRESSED DOUBTS ABOUT THE VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF-------- THE PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL PROCESS. SOME HAVE EVEN SUGGESTED THAT-------- THE PROCESS IS SO INHERENTLY FLAWED THAT IT MAY BE-------- IMPOSSIBLE TO PERFECT IT (SEE---------------------- DERVEN------------, 1990, FOR EXAMPLE).------------------------- AT THE OTHER EXTREME, THERE ARE MANY STRONG ADVOCATES OF-------- PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL. SOME VIEW IT AS POTENTIALLY------------- "... THE MOST CRUCIAL ASPECT OF ORGANIZATIONAL-------- LIFE-----" (----------------------LAWRIE------------, 1990).---------------------------------------------------------- BETWEEN-------- THESE TWO EXTREMES LIE VARIOUS SCHOOLS OF BELIEF. WHILE-------- ALL ENDORSE THE USE OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL, THERE ARE MANY-------- DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON HOW AND WHEN TO APPLY IT.-------------------------- THERE ARE THOSE, FOR INSTANCE, WHO BELIEVE THAT-------- PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL HAS MANY IMPORTANT EMPLOYEE-------- DEVELOPMENT USES, BUT SCORN ANY ATTEMPT TO LINK THE-------- PROCESS TO REWARD OUTCOMES - SUCH AS PAY RISES AND-------- PROMOTIONS.------------------------- THIS GROUP BELIEVES THAT THE LINKAGE TO REWARD OUTCOMES-------- REDUCES OR ELIMINATES THE DEVELOPMENTAL VALUE OF-------- APPRAISALS. RATHER THAN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CONSTRUCTIVE-------- REVIEW AND ENCOURAGEMENT, THE REWARD-LINKED PROCESS IS-------- PERCEIVED AS JUDGMENTAL, PUNITIVE AND HARROWING.------------------------- FOR EXAMPLE, HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD GLADLY ADMIT THEIR-------- WORK PROBLEMS IF, AT THE SAME TIME, THEY KNEW THAT THEIR-------- NEXT PAY RISE OR A MUCH-WANTED PROMOTION WAS RIDING ON AN-------- APPRAISAL RESULT? VERY LIKELY, IN THAT SITUATION, MANY-------- PEOPLE WOULD DENY OR DOWNPLAY THEIR WEAKNESSES.------------------------- NOR IS THE DESIRE TO DISTORT OR DENY THE TRUTH CONFINED-------- TO THE PERSON BEING APPRAISED. MANY APPRAISERS FEEL-------- UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE COMBINED ROLE OF JUDGE AND-------- EXECUTIONER.---------------------------------------------------------- SUCH-------- RELUCTANCE IS NOT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND. APPRAISERS-------- OFTEN KNOW THEIR APPRAISEES WELL, AND ARE TYPICALLY IN A-------- DIRECT SUBORDINATE-SUPERVISOR RELATIONSHIP. THEY WORK-------- TOGETHER ON A DAILY BASIS AND MAY, AT TIMES, MIX-------- SOCIALLY. SUGGESTING THAT A SUBORDINATE NEEDS TO BRUSH UP-------- ON CERTAIN WORK SKILLS IS ONE THING; GIVING AN APPRAISAL-------- RESULT THAT HAS THE DIRECT EFFECT OF NEGATING A PROMOTION-------- IS ANOTHER.---------------------------------------------------------- THE-------- RESULT CAN BE-RESENTMENT AND SERIOUS MORALE DAMAGE--------, LEADING TO WORKPLACE DISRUPTION, SOURED RELATIONSHIPS AND-------- PRODUCTIVITY DECLINES.---------------------------------------------------------- ON-------- THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS A STRONG RIVAL ARGUMENT WHICH-------- CLAIMS THAT PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL MUST UNEQUIVOCALLY BE-------- LINKED TO REWARD OUTCOMES.---------------------------------------------------------- THE-------- ADVOCATES OF THIS APPROACH SAY THAT ORGANIZATIONS MUST-------- HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH REWARDS - WHICH ARE NOT AN-------- UNLIMITED RESOURCE - MAY BE OPENLY AND FAIRLY DISTRIBUTED-------- TO THOSE MOST DESERVING ON THE BASIS OF MERIT, EFFORT AND-------- RESULTS.---------------------------------------------------------- THERE-------- IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR REMUNERATIVE JUSTICE IN-------- ORGANIZATIONS. PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL - WHATEVER ITS-------- PRACTICAL FLAWS - IS THE ONLY PROCESS AVAILABLE TO HELP-------- ACHIEVE FAIR, DECENT AND CONSISTENT REWARD OUTCOMES.---------------------------------------------------------- IT-------- HAS ALSO BEEN CLAIMED THAT APPRAISEES THEMSELVES ARE-------- INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT APPRAISAL RESULTS SHOULD BE-------- LINKED DIRECTLY TO REWARD OUTCOMES - AND ARE SUSPICIOUS-------- AND DISAPPOINTED WHEN TOLD THIS IS NOT THE CASE. RATHER-------- THAN FEELING RELIEVED, APPRAISEES MAY SUSPECT THAT THEY-------- ARE NOT BEING TOLD THE WHOLE TRUTH, OR THAT THE APPRAISAL-------- PROCESS IS A SHAM AND WASTE OF TIME.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE LINK-------- TO REWARDS---------------- RECENT RESEARCH (------------------------------BANNISTER---- & BALKIN, 1990)------------ HAS REPORTED THAT-------- APPRAISEES SEEM TO HAVE GREATER ACCEPTANCE OF THE-------- APPRAISAL PROCESS, AND FEEL MORE SATISFIED WITH IT, WHEN-------- THE PROCESS IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO REWARDS. SUCH FINDINGS-------- ARE A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO THOSE WHO FEEL THAT APPRAISAL-------- RESULTS AND REWARD OUTCOMES MUST BE STRICTLY ISOLATED-------- FROM EACH OTHER.---------------------------------------------------------- THERE-------- IS ALSO A GROUP WHO ARGUES THAT THE EVALUATION OF-------- EMPLOYEES FOR REWARD PURPOSES, AND FRANK COMMUNICATION-------- WITH THEM ABOUT THEIR PERFORMANCE, ARE PART OF THE BASIC-------- RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT. THE PRACTICE OF NOT-------- DISCUSSING REWARD ISSUES WHILE APPRAISING PERFORMANCE IS--------, SAY CRITICS, BASED ON INCONSISTENT AND MUDDLED IDEAS OF-------- MOTIVATION.---------------------------------------------------------- IN-------- MANY ORGANIZATIONS, THIS INCONSISTENCY IS AGGRAVATED BY-------- THE PRACTICE OF HAVING SEPARATE WAGE AND SALARY REVIEWS--------, IN WHICH MERIT RISES AND BONUSES ARE DECIDED ARBITRARILY--------, AND OFTEN SECRETLY, BY SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SEE---------------------- LICENSE-------- INFORMATION---- TO BECOME A USER OF THE------------- ARCHER NORTH PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL SYSTEM----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
