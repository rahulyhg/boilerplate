I-TEST, I TEST, I---- TEST. THE PROBLEM IS TESTING HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH HEALTHY DOGS AND---- UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT THE CASE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TESTING IS MERELY A TOOL---- IN THE BREEDER'S ARSENAL, ALONG WITH DOG SHOWS, PEDIGREES, VACCINATIONS AND---- OTHER HEALTH CHECKS, CORRECT DIETS, ETC. TO HELP THEM FIND WAYS TO BREED BETTER---- AND HEALTHIER DOGS. BY MERELY DOING THE TESTS HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT MEAN THE---- DOGS' OFFSPRING WILL NECESSARILY BE HEALTHY AND NOT DEVELOP A GENETIC-DEFECT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TO START WITH, LET ME SAY-THAT IF YOUR SOLE INTEREST IN HAVING A---- DOG IS TO HAVE A COMPANION WITH THE LIKELIHOOD OF NO GENETIC HEALTH PROBLEMS A---- PUREBRED DOG OR EVEN A MIXED BREED-IS NOT FOR YOU. GO TO-THE HUMANE SOCIETY AND---- ASK FOR A MUTT OR HEINZ 57 WITH LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO ANY BREED. BECAUSE OF---- SOMETHING CALLED HYBRID VIGOR THIS WILL GIVE YOU-THE BEST CHANCE OF HAVING A---- DOG THAT IS UNLIKELY TO DEVELOP A GENETIC DEFECT, THOUGH IT MAY STILL POSSIBLY---- HAVE-HEALTH PROBLEMS. IF,-HOWEVER, YOU ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING A PUREBRED DOG---- WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS AND TEMPERAMENT YOU LIKE THEN BE PREPARED FOR THE---- CHANCE THAT YOUR DOG MAY DEVELOP A DISEASE TO WHICH THE BREED IS PREDISPOSED.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THERE ARE MANY ARTICLES IN DOG MAGAZINES AND ON THE INTERNET---- THAT LAY THE BLAME FOR GENETIC DEFECTS ON THE CARELESS BREEDING BY DOG---- BREEDERS. WELL THERE IS REALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FIRST WHICH BREEDERS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? IN THE US ALONE---- NEARLY 75% OF THE PUREBRED POPULATION IS SUPPLIED BY THE PUPPY MILLS AND-----BACKYARD BREEDERS. THESE ARE BREEDERS WHO DO NOT CARE OR UNDERSTAND ABOUT---- BREEDING HEALTHY DOGS, THEY REALLY-DON'T EVEN CARE IF THE DOG PARTICULARLY---- LOOKS LIKE THE BREED IT IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT. THERE IS-LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT-----BREEDING THE "RIGHT"-DOG TO THE "RIGHT" BITCH, HALF THE TIME THEY PROBABLY---- AREN'T EVEN SURE WHO THE FATHER WAS--COULD HAVE BEEN A FATHER OR BROTHER, MAY---- NOT EVEN BE THE RIGHT BREED. THE MOTHERS ARE NOT CHECKED FOR HEALTH PRIOR TO---- BEING BRED, NOR ARE THEY PROPERLY NOURISHED WHILE PREGNANT OR NURSING. FORGET---- PROPER ANIMAL HUSBANDRY PROCEDURES. AS FOR TESTING PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH----, IT WOULD CUT INTO THE PROFIT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THEN THERE ARE THE---- COMPARATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PUREBRED DOG BREEDERS WHO BREED DOGS FOR SHOW---- PURPOSES. THEY, UNFORTUNATELY, SEEM TO GET LUMPED WITH MOST OF THE BLAME FOR---- THE STATE OF THE GENETIC HEALTH OF THE PUREBREDS. HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE THE---- COMMENTS THAT SHOW DOG BREEDERS DON'T CARE ABOUT THE GENETIC HEALTH OF THE DOGS---- THEY ARE BREEDING? THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. WE DO CARE, BUT WE ALSO CARE---- ABOUT MANY OTHER FACTORS THAT MAKE UP THE WHOLE DOG. EACH BREED IS SET A---- GUIDELINE (STANDARD) WITHIN WHICH THE BREEDER MUST BREED SO THAT THE DOGS WE---- PRODUCE BEST REPRESENT THE BREED. THOSE GUIDELINES GENERALLY COVER EVERYTHING---- FROM THE LOOK OF THE DOG, THE STRUCTURE, THE MOVEMENT, THE TEMPERAMENT AND SO---- ON. BY SHOWING OUR DOGS THIS ALLOWS US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ACCOMPLISHING---- OUR GOALS. AFTER ALL IF YOU WANTED TO BUY A CAVALIER KING CHARLES SPANIEL YOU---- WOULD NOT BE HAPPY IF IT LOOKED AND ACTED LIKE A BEAGLE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ONE READS MANY ARTICLES BY BOTH VETERINARIANS AND WHAT MIGHT---- BEST BE DESCRIBED AS ARMCHAIR BREEDERS WHICH SEEM TO INFER THAT IT IS REALLY---- SIMPLE TO FIX THE GENETIC PROBLEMS IN PUREBRED DOGS. OH WOULD THIS BE TRUE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 300 KNOWN GENETIC DISEASES IN DOGS----, THOUGH NOT ALL IN EACH BREED. MANY OF THE PUREBRED BREEDS HAVE ON AVERAGE THE---- PREDISPOSITION TO 2- OR MORE GENETIC DEFECTS PARTICULAR TO EACH BREED. SOME OF---- THE GENETIC DEFECTS WILL BE JUST MINOR PROBLEMS, WHILE OTHERS ARE MORE SEVERE---- AND LIFE THREATENING. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL OF THE DOGS IN THAT BREED---- WILL CARRY THE GENE FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE DEFECTS, JUST THAT THE---- POSSIBILITY IS THERE. ON TOP OF THIS THERE ARE MANY OTHER DISEASES WHICH A DOG---- COULD DEVELOP THAT MAY NOT BE GENETICALLY LINKED TO THE BREED.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IF ONE HAS EVEN A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF GENETICS ONE STARTS TO---- REALIZE JUST HOW DIFFICULT THE TASK BECOMES IN PRODUCING DOGS FREE OF ANY OF---- THE KNOWN GENETIC DEFECTS TO WHICH THEY MAY BE PRONE. THE MAJORITY OF THE---- GENETIC DEFECTS ARE CARRIED BY RECESSIVE OR HIDDEN GENES. DOGS CAN CARRY A---- RECESSIVE GENE FOR A DISEASE AND YET NEVER BE AFFECTED. IT GETS MORE DIFFICULT---- AS MANY OF THE DEFECTS ARE REFERRED TO AS POLYGENIC WHICH IS WHERE MORE-THAN---- ONE GENE IS REQUIRED TO CAUSE THE DEFECT. THEN THERE ARE THE CONDITIONS WHICH---- ARE MULTIFACTORIAL IN-NATURE AS WELL. A DOG MAY CARRY-A GENE FOR A CERTAIN-----CONDITION BUT BECAUSE OF FACTORS UNKNOWN IT MAY OR MAY NOT EXPRESS ITSELF IN---- THAT DOG. MITRAL VALVE DISEASE IS ONE SUCH DISEASE. IT IS-ESTIMATED THAT THE---- LARGE MAJORITY OF CAVALIER KING CHARLES SPANIELS CARRY THE GENE/S FOR MVD BUT---- AS YET IT IS TOTALLY UNKNOWN AND MAY NEVER BE KNOWN WHAT EXACTLY THE CONDITIONS---- ARE THAT LEAD TO THE DISEASE EXPRESSING ITSELF IN SOME DOGS AND AT AN EARLY AGE---- AND NOT IN OTHERS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHERE DOES TESTING COME-----INTO THE EQUATION? TESTING ALLOWS THE BREEDER TO HAVE A SNAPSHOT OF THE DOG'S---- HEALTH FOR A SPECIFIC CONDITION AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. AT THIS STAGE---- WITH THE AVERAGE GENETIC DEFECT NO DEFINITIVE TEST SUCH AS DNA TESTING HAS BEEN---- DEVELOPED FOR THE MAJORITY OF DISEASES, LARGELY BECAUSE THE GENES FOR THE---- PARTICULAR DISEASES HAVE YET TO BE IDENTIFIED. WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS SUCH AS HIP---- DYSPLASIA WHERE AN X-RAY CAN BE DONE ONCE AT 2 YEARS OF AGE TO GRADE THE HIP---- JOINT, MANY TESTS SUCH AS EYES AND HEARTS SHOULD BE DONE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS---- SOME DISEASES CAN BECOME CLINICAL AT ANY AGE. FOR EXAMPLE A DOG MAY BE CLEAR OF---- A HEART MURMUR AT 2 YEARS OF AGE BUT HAVE DEVELOPED ONE A COUPLE OF MONTHS---- LATER. CURRENT TESTING OF MANY DEFECTS DOES NOT TELL A BREEDER IF A DOG IS---- GOING TO BE CLEAR OF A GENETIC DEFECT FOR ITS LIFETIME JUST THAT IT IS---- CURRENTLY HEALTHY. AND AT PRESENT IT DOES NOT (AND MAY NEVER) TELL A BREEDER---- THAT, THOUGH THEIR DOG IS CLINICALLY CLEAR OF A GENETIC DEFECT, THAT IT DOES---- NOT CARRY THE GENE FOR THAT PARTICULAR DEFECT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SO WHAT IS THE POINT OF---- TESTING? IT ALLOWS BREEDERS TO MAKE REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON THE OVERALL---- RESULTS OF THE TESTING IN THEIR DOGS. FOR EXAMPLE SHOULD A DOG PROVE, THROUGH---- TESTING, TO BE CLINICALLY AFFECTED BY A CERTAIN GENETIC DEFECT FOR WHICH THE---- BREED IS PREDISPOSED, A BREEDER BASED UPON THE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT DISEASE AND---- ITS MODE OF INHERITANCE, CAN ATTEMPT TO ANALYSE HOW THAT DOG CAME TO BE---- AFFECTED AND MAKE DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO OTHER-RELATED DOGS IN THEIR---- BREEDING PROGRAMS. THE EASY ANSWER WOULD BE TO REMOVE ALL RELATED DOGS FROM---- THEIR BREEDING PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY COULD POTENTIALLY BE CARRIERS OF THAT---- DISEASE, BUT WHAT IF THOSE DOGS-ARE CLEAR OF MOST OR ALL OF THE OTHER 20 OR SO---- GENETIC DEFECTS THAT COULD AFFECT THE BREED? WHAT IF THOSE DOGS ARE VERY GOOD---- REPRESENTATIVES OF THEIR BREED AND HAVE THE CORRECT TERMPERAMENTS? WHAT-IF THEY---- ARE DOGS THAT ARE PRODUCING DOGS-THAT ARE OVERALL HEALTHY AND LONG LIVED? IT---- WOULD BE A BIT LIKE THROWING-THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER. INSTEAD BREEDERS---- HAVE TO MAKE JUDGMENT CALLS AND IT BECOMES A MATTER OF BALANCE, BREEDING FOR AN---- OVERALL HEALTHY, SOUND DOG OF CORRECT BREED TYPE AND TEMPERAMENT. THEY MAY---- CHOOSE TO CONTINUE TO BREED THE DOGS WHO MAY POTENTIALLY BE CARRIERS OF A---- GENETIC DEFECT BUT AVOID DOUBLING ON IT BY BREEDING TO DOGS WHO HAVE NOT---- PRODUCED THE SIMILAR DEFECT.-------- TESTING COULD BECOME THE DOUBLE EDGED---- SWORD IN THE WORLD OF PUREBRED DOGS. SOME BREEDERS FEEL THE NEED TO USE THE---- TESTING MANTRA AS A WAY TO "BEAT" UP ON OTHER BREEDERS AND ULTIMATELY SELL MORE---- PUPPIES. THEY WILL CLAIM THAT THEY DO MORE TESTING, BETTER TESTING OR THAT---- THEIR COMPETITION REALLY DOESN'T TEST AND IS LYING. DOES THIS MAKE THE DOGS---- THAT THEY ARE SELLING ANY HEALTHIER THAN THEIR COMPETITION? NO! EVEN IF THEY DO-----ONE OR TWO MORE TESTS FOR-THE GENETIC DEFECTS THAT A BREED IS PREDISPOSED TO----, THEY ARE STILL ONLY TESTING FOR-A HANDFUL OF DISEASES. ALSO SOME BREEDERS-----BECOME SO ENGROSSED WITH TRYING TO TEST AND BREED OUT, FROM THEIR DOGS, THAT---- SMALL HANDFUL OF DISEASES THAT THEY COMPLETELY FORGET THE ENTIRE DOG. OTHER---- UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS START TO CREEP INTO THEIR LINES, SO WHILE THEY MAY HAVE---- DEVELOPED A DOG THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE ONE PARTICULAR DISEASE THAT THEY HAVE---- BEEN CONCENTRATING ON, IT COULD HAVE A MYRIAD OF OTHER HEALTH AND TEMPERAMENT---- PROBLEMS.-------- WHEN TALKING TO A BREEDER ABOUT THEIR DOGS, WHILE IT IS---- VALUABLE TO KNOW THE RESULTS OF THE TESTING THAT THEY HAVE DONE ON THEIR DOGS----, YOU SHOULD GO BEYOND THE CERTIFICATES AND DELVE INTO THE BREEDER'S PARTICULAR---- UNDERSTANDING OF THE GENETIC CONDITIONS THAT THEY ARE TESTING FOR, WHAT IT IS----, WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT THE MODE OF INHERITANCE, WHAT THE BREEDER DOES (OTHER---- THAN THE TESTING) TO TRY TO ELIMINATE THE DEFECT FROM THEIR DOGS. DO THEY---- FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES OR PROTOCOLS SET DOWN BY THE SPECIALISTS? BEYOND THOSE---- SPECIFIC DEFECTS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TESTING FOR, HOW DO THEY ENSURE THAT THE---- DOGS THEY ARE PRODUCING ARE GOING TO BE FREE OF OTHER POSSIBLE DISEASES? HOW---- LONG ARE THEIR DOGS LIVING? WHAT IS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THEIR DOGS? WHAT DO---- THEY DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR DOGS ARE GOOD SPECIMENS OF THE BREED? WHAT ARE---- THEY DOING TO ENSURE THAT THE DOGS THEY ARE PRODUCING ARE OF GOOD TEMPERAMENT?---- HAVE THEY EVER PRODUCED DOGS WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS AND WHAT WERE THEY? IT IS NO---- CRIME FOR A BREEDER TO HAVE PRODUCED SOME DOGS THAT MAY HAVE HAD HEALTH---- PROBLEMS, THEY ARE AFTER ALL LIVING CREATURES AND NOTHING IN LIFE IS CERTAIN----, IT IS HOWEVER A CRIME NOT TO ADMIT IT.-------- YES, TESTING IS HELPFUL BUT IT---- IS NOT THE WHOLE STORY TO BREEDING HEALTHIER, LONG-LIVED-DOGS OF CORRECT BREED---- TYPE AND-TEMPERAMENT. BREEDERS MUST LEARN TO USE ALL THE TOOLS AT THEIR---- DISPOSAL AND START TO BE MORE OPEN-ABOUT PROBLEMS THAT THEIR DOGS MAY HAVE---- PRODUCED-FOR THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE PUREBRED DOG WORLD.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
