-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF FISHES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ DID YOU KNOW THAT FISHES EMBARK UPON COURTSHIP BEHAVIOUR THAT LEADS TO---- PAIRING AND SPAWNING? MANY PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY UNAWARE OF THIS. THE COURTSHIP OF FISHES IN---- NOT AS COMPLEX NOR AS VARIED AS THAT OF MEN AND WOMEN, AND THE COURTSHIP OF FISHES IS NOT---- COMPLICATED BY INNUENDOS, HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CRYPTIC SIGNALS AS IN HOMO SAPIENS. RATHER----, COURTSHIP IN FISHES, AS WITH BIRDS, MAMMALS AND OTHER ANIMALS, COMPRISES SETS OF---- RECOGNISABLE SIGNALS, FOLLOWING SET SEQUENCES WHICH FOR FISHES, PROVIDED THE PARTNERS ARE---- PHYSIOLOGICALLY READY, CULMINATE IN SPAWNING. COURTSHIP BEHAVIOUR OF FISHES MIGHT BE A---- SIMPLE SET OF SIGNALS AND ANSWERS OR IT MIGHT BE VERY ELABORATE AND COMPLEX, DEPENDING ON---- THE TYPE OF FISH. HOWEVER, THE SIGNALS ARE ALWAYS EASY FOR POTENTIAL MATES TO READ.---- INDEED, IT IS EASY FOR BIOLOGISTS TO READ AND INTERPRET THESE SIGNALS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AMONG THE MOST INTERESTING AND BEST KNOWN TO AQUARISTS IS THE ELABORATE---- COURTSHIP OF CICHLID FISHES. TYPICALLY A MALE DEVELOPS-A TERRITORY WHICH HE DEFENDS-FROM---- ALL INTRUDERS. MANY SPECIES ALSO BUILD NESTS, WHICH MIGHT BE ELABORATE SAND CASTLES, OR---- EXCAVATIONS WITH TUNNELS OR-BURROWS, OR MAY SIMPLY BE A CLEANED PART OF THE ROCKY OR SANDY-----AREA IN WHICH THE TERRITORY-IS HELD. ONCE-THE TASKS OF DEVELOPING A TERRITORY AND BUILDING---- A NEST ARE COMPLETE THE MALE IS READY TO INVITE FEMALES TO HIS NEST TO SPAWN. EAGER MALES---- MAY ATTEMPT TO DO THIS EVEN BEFORE THE NEST IS COMPLETE--BUT THEY ARE NEARLY ALWAYS---- REFUSED AS THE FEMALE DOES NOT GET ALL THE CORRECT MESSAGES IF THE NEST IS NOT THERE.-ONE---- OF THE REASONS FOR THIS IS THAT-PART OF THE COURTSHIP RITUAL INCLUDES THE NEST, AND EACH---- NEST TYPE IS SPECIES-SPECIFIC; IT IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SPECIES THAT IS IMPORTANT TO---- MATE RECOGNITION AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE CORRECT PARTNER.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE INITIAL INVITATION IS----- `SIDE-SHAKE'----- DURING WHICH THE MALE---- APPROACHES A FEMALE, EXTENDS HIS FINS AND FLEXES SO THAT THE ANAL FIN, WHICH USUALLY HAS---- ATTRACTIVE SPOTS AND COLOURS ON IT, TOWARDS THE FEMALE. IF THE FEMALE IS INTERESTED THE---- MALE THEN TURNS AWAY AND FACING THE SPAWNING SITE BEATS ITS TAIL IN A MOVEMENT INVITING---- THE FEMALE TO FOLLOW----- (`FOLLOW-SHAKE'-----). IF THE FEMALE IS STILL INTERESTED, THEN---- WITH EXAGGERATED, UNDULATING MOVEMENTS THE MALE-LEADS THE FEMALE TO THE SPAWNING SITE---- (LEAD-SWIM). ONCE IN THE NEST-OR SPAWNING SITE, THE COUPLE CIRCLE EACH OTHER, PERFORM A---- VARIETY OF SHAKES (NEST SHAKE, VERTICAL NEST SHAKE ETC) AND GENTLY NUDGE EACH OTHER TILL---- THE FEMALE LAYS EGGS. THE FEMALE THEN PICKS UP THE EGGS-IN HER MOUTH, SOMETIMES DOING SO---- BEFORE THE MALE HAS HAD TIME TO FERTILISE-THEM. THIS WOULD BE A WASTE OF EGGS, SO TO SOLVE---- THE PROBLEM THE MALES OF MANY SPECIES HAVE DUMMY EGGS ON THE ANAL FIN.-THIS FIN IS SPREAD---- OUT IN FRONT OF THE FEMALE TO DISPLAY THE EGG DUMMIES AND CURLED SLIGHTLY TO HOLD---- SPERMATOZOA THAT HE WILL RELEASE. THE FEMALE TRIES TO PICK THE EGG DUMMIES FROM THE MALE---- ANAL FIN AND IN DOING SO COLLECTS SPERMATOZOA, THAT FERTILISE THE EGGS IN HER MOUTH. THE---- NEED TO COLLECT THE EGGS BEFORE THEY ARE FERTILISED AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT EGGS ARE---- OFTEN STOLEN ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY APPEAR BY OTHER FISHES WHICH FEED UPON THEM. ANOTHER---- PROBLEM IS THAT MALES THAT DO NOT HAVE TERRITORIES, AND WERE NOT CHOSEN AS MATES BY THE ----FEMALE, TRY TO SNEAK SPAWNINGS BY DARTING DOWN BETWEEN THE SPAWNING COUPLE AND FERTILISING---- EGGS THAT ARE EXPOSED. BY COLLECTING THE EGGS PROMPTLY, THE EFFORTS OF ROBBERS AND---- SNEAKERS ARE LARGELY CIRCUMVENTED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ONCE IN THE MOUTH THE EGGS DEVELOP INTO YOUNG FISH THAT REMAIN THERE---- UNTIL THEY ARE READY TO FEED FOR THEMSELVES. MOST CICHLIDS WILL THEN LOOK AFTER THEIR---- YOUNG FOR SOMETIME (A FEW DAYS TO FOUR OR MORE WEEKS), TAKING THEM INTO THEIR MOUTHS WHEN---- THERE IS A THREAT FROM PREDATORS. THE FRY ARE ALSO TAKEN INTO THE MOUTH AT NIGHT FOR---- SAFEKEEPING. ONCE THE FRY ARE INDEPENDENT THEY LEAVE-THE CARE OF THE MOTHER. SOME CICHLIDS---- BEHAVE AS CUCKOOS; THEY GIVE THEIR FRY TO ANOTHER SPECIES TO CARE FOR. IT SEEMS THAT-THE---- FOSTER PARENT CAN RECOGNISE THE FOREIGN-YOUNG, BUT SHE IS UNABLE TO CHASE THEM AWAY OR---- SWALLOW THEM AS BOTH ACTIVITIES WILL ENDANGER HER-OWN BROOD. CHASING FOREIGN FRY THAT ARE---- MIXED TIGHTLY IN A SCHOOL WITH ONES OWN FRY IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT CHASING AWAY THE OWN---- FRY TOO. SIMILARLY, HOW DOES THE MOTHER SWALLOW FOREIGN FRY AND NOT HER OWN?-------------------------------------------------- SUBMITTED BY: DR TONY RIBBINK--------------------------- EMAIL:-------------------------------------------------- A.RIBBINK@RU.AC.ZA--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
