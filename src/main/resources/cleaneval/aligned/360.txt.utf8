HIS PARTS HEREIN ARE------------------------------------------------ ENCASED IN YELLOW-------. WHAT I-------- DON'T SAY IN THE BOOK IS THAT AFTER SUZUKI, WITH HIS WIFE PRESENT, HAD-------- ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD CANCER TO HIS DISCIPLES, WHO WERE THERE IN THE-------- CITY AND WHO'D COME FROM OUTSIDE NOT KNOWING WHY, AND TO RYUHO, RYUHO-------- WAS SAID TO BE THE ONLY ONE WHO CRIED. AND HE CRIED HARD, SITTING ON THE-------- FLOOR. HE WAS DEVASTATED AND HE EMOTED WITHOUT RESERVATION THOUGH HE'D-------- ONLY KNOWN SUZUKI FOR TWO WEEKS AT THE TIME. - DC---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  T-----------------------------------------------O OBSERVE THINGS IN A------ FLASH-THAT IS NONDUALITY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SILAS HAD GIVEN SOME LECTURES THAT SUMMER AT SUZUKI'S BEHEST. IN EARLY------ SEPTEMBER SUZUKI ASKED SILAS TO COME SEE HIM. AS THEY TALKED, SEATED IN------ THE TATAMI ROOM OF SUZUKI'S APARTMENT, SUZUKI FINGERED HIS MALA, A------ BUDDHIST ROSARY. IT HAD LARGE SANDALWOOD BEADS, EACH CARVED INTO THE SHAPE------ OF A SKULL. SILAS LOOKED AT THE SKULLS AND AT SUZUKI, AND HE FELT DEEPLY------ APPREHENSIVE.------------- SUZUKI WAS VERY ILL. HIS SKIN WAS YELLOW; THE DOCTOR SAID HE HAD------ HEPATITIS. OKUSAN WAS TAKING CARE OF HIM WITH ASSISTANCE FROM YVONNE, WHO------ ALSO KEPT HIM ABREAST OF ZEN CENTER MATTERS. THEY WERE VERY CAREFUL TO-------AVOID INFECTION AND DIDN'T SHARE ANY FOOD WITH HIM, AS HAD BEEN THEIR------ HABIT. ASIDE FROM ATTENDING AN OCCASIONAL ZAZEN, THE LAST TIME HE'D DONE------ ANYTHING IN PUBLIC WAS THE LAY ORDINATION FOR FIFTY-FIVE STUDENTS AT THE------ END OF AUGUST. HE HADN'T EVEN BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND HIS OWN ORDINATION OF------ FOUR NEW PRIESTS IN SEPTEMBER. KATAGIRI, NOW CALLED KATAGIRI-ROSHI AT------ SUZUKI'S REQUEST, PERFORMED IT FOR HIM BY PROXY, HAVING COME UP FROM------ TASSAJARA WHERE HE WAS LEADING THE PRACTICE PERIOD. ED BROWN WAS FIRST IN------ LINE, THEN ME, THEN LEW RICHMOND, WHO'D BEEN STUDYING WITH SUZUKI SINCE------ 1967, AND ANGIE RUNYON.------------- SUZUKI'S ABSENCE WAS CONSPICUOUS. IT WAS A SOMBER OCCASION. AFTERWARD------ WE ALL WENT TO HIS APARTMENT TO GREET HIM AND STOOD AT HIS BEDSIDE. HE------ ACTED LIKE IT WAS THE HAPPIEST DAY OF HIS LIFE. AFTER LEAVING HIS ROOM I------ WENT UP ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING, WALKED AMIDST THE POTTED PLANTS------, LOOKED OUT OVER SAN-FRANCISCO, AND CRIED.------------------------------------------------------------------------- A YOUNG MONK NAMED RYUHO YAMADA------ ARRIVED FROM JAPAN IN LATE SEPTEMBER. OVER TEA, OKUSAN LEARNED THAT HE------ KNEW THE HEALING ARTS OF--- SHIATSU---- (PRESSURE-POINT MASSAGE) AND------ ACUPUNCTURE. SHE ASKED HIM TO GIVE HER A TREATMENT, AND HE PASSED THE------ TEST. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE GONE STRAIGHT DOWN TO TASSAJARA, BUT NOW HE------ WAS NEEDED IN THE CITY. EVERY AFTERNOON HE WORKED ON SUZUKI FOR A COUPLE------ OF HOURS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RYUHO WAS A THICK-SPECTACLED------, ENTHUSIASTIC, NAIVE YOUNG MONK, AND HE IMMEDIATELY STARTED GOBBLING UP THE------ STRANGE EXPERIENCE OF ZEN IN AMERICA. HE KNEW QUITE A BIT OF ENGLISH AND------ SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING WITH STUDENTS.----------------------------------------------------------------- "RYUHO-SAN, IF YOU------ CONTINUE TO LIVE IN AMERICA, AND YOU WANT TO BE A SUCCESS IN AMERICA, YOU------ HAVE TO BE MAJIME. IF YOU ARE NOT MAJIME YOU WILL NOT BE------ APPRECIATED.-----" SUZUKI WAS SITTING UP IN BED, TALKING IN JAPANESE TO------ THE NEW MONK. OKUSAN HAD TOLD HIM THE SAME THING.----- "JUST BE MAJIME AND------ YOU'LL HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.-----------------------------------------------------------------" MAJIME IS USUALLY TRANSLATED AS----------- "SERIOUS,-----" BUT IT INCLUDES THE QUALITIES OF SINCERITY AND------ ENTHUSIASM. IN JAPAN, RYUHO KNEW HE COULD EASILY GET BY AS A PRIEST WITH------ CANNED MAJIME; THERE WERE CENTURIES OF TRADITION AND THE CLOUD OF------ VAGUENESS TO HIDE IN. BUT IN AMERICA THE STUDENTS WERE STRAIGHTFORWARD------, AND EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR. HE LOVED THE COMMUNAL ASPECTS OF ZEN CENTER: THE------ NATURAL FOOD, WOMEN AND MEN LIVING TOGETHER ON AN EQUAL BASIS. EVEN------ SUZUKI'S WIFE WAS WILLFUL AND WOULD TANGLE WITH HIM. THE STUDENTS SAW IN------ RYUHO, AS IN OTHER JAPANESE MONKS, QUALITIES THAT THEY ADMIRED. A PERFECT------ PLACE FOR JAPANESE MONKS, HE THOUGHT. THEY CAN LEARN FROM US, AND WE CAN------ LEARN FROM THEM.------------------------------------------------------------ RYUHO DISCOVERED SUZUKI COULD------ BE SHORT-TEMPERED. ONCE RYUHO COMMENTED ON A BUDDHA STATUE, CASUALLY------ SAYING IT WAS JUST A PIECE OF WOOD. SUZUKI BARKED AT HIM NOT TO SPEAK SO------ FLIPPANTLY: UNTIL HE KNEW THE TRUE MEANING OF THE STATUE HE SHOULD SHUT------ UP. THEN AS QUICKLY AS THE ANGER CAME, IT WAS GONE. AH, THOUGHT RYUHO------, HE'S INNOCENT AND HONEST, LIKE A CHILD.--------------------------------------------- "SO, YOU'VE COME TO SEE OUR YELLOW ROSHI,-----" YVONNE SAID, AND------ THAT'S HOW ALBERT STUNKARD-LEARNED SUZUKI WAS ILL.------------------ "YELLOW?-----" HE ASKED.------------------ "YES, HE HAS HEPATITIS.------------------" DR. ALBERT STUNKARD WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE------ UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. IN SEPTEMBER 1971 HE HAD COME OUT TO WORK AT------ STANFORD HOSPITAL FOR A YEAR, LARGELY BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE NEAR SUZUKI------, WHOM HE HAD STUDIED WITH IN THE------------- PAST. STUNKARD, ONE OF THE SENIOR ZEN PRACTITIONERS IN THE STATES, HAD------ STARTED HIS STUDY WHEN HE WAS A DOCTOR TO JAPANESE PRISONERS BEING TRIED------ FOR WAR CRIMES IN TOKYO IN------ ONE OF THEM HAD TOLD HIM ABOUT D. T.------ SUZUKI. HE MET THE GREAT SCHOLAR AND SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME HIS STUDENT AND ------OCCASIONAL DOCTOR. STUNKARD HAD STUDIED WITH NAKAGAWA, YASUTANI, AND OTHER------ TEACHERS AS WELL. HE MET-SHUNRYU SUZUKI FOR THE FIRST TIME AT SOKOJI IN--------967, AND SUZUKI EMBARRASSED HIM BY ASKING HIM TO DELIVER THE LECTURE FOR------ THAT EVENING.------------- ENTERING SUZUKI'S BEDROOM, STUNKARD SAW THAT SUZUKI WAS SCRATCHING. A------ CHILL WENT DOWN STUNKARD'S SPINE. HE KNEW THERE WERE TWO TYPES OF JAUNDICE-ONE------ INFECTIOUS (HEPATITIS), THE-OTHER OBSTRUCTIVE. AN OBSTRUCTION TO THE------ OUTFLOW OF BILE CAUSES ITCHING. THE OBSTRUCTION COULDN-T BE GALLSTONES------ BECAUSE SUZUKI'S GALL BLADDER HAD BEEN REMOVED. STUNKARD FELT TERRIBLE BUT------ DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING AT THE TIME. HE JUST ASKED IF HE COULD CONFER WITH------ SUZUKI'S DOCTOR.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I-----------------------------------------------F YOU WERE NOT BORN IN------ THIS WORLD, THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO DIE.------------- TO BE BORN IN THIS WORLD IS TO DIE, TO DISAPPEAR [LAUGHING].--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ON OCTOBER 10, 1971, SHUNRYU SUZUKI CALLED HIS BAY AREA DISCIPLES------ TOGETHER. THEY WERE ASKED TO WEAR THEIR ROBES. AT TEN O'CLOCK THEY ENTERED------ THE APARTMENT AND GATHERED AROUND HIS BED, JOINING HIS TEAM OF CAREGIVERS-----------------------------------------------RYUHO SITTING ON THE FLOOR-------------, OKUSAN BY THE DOOR, LOOKING TIRED, AND YVONNE AT THE BEDSIDE FUSSING WITH------ SUZUKI OVER AN OFFICE CASSETTE RECORDER. MEL HAD DRIVEN IN FROM BERKELEY------ AND BILL FROM MILL VALLEY. ALSO PRESENT WERE SILAS, REB, LEW, AND ANGIE------, ALL OF WHOM LIVED IN THE BUILDING. CLAUDE CAME FROM HIS HOME IN SAN------ FRANCISCO. EVERYONE WAS QUIET. THERE WAS A FEELING OF TENSE ANTICIPATION.------------- SUZUKI SAT UP IN BED, PROPPED UP BY PILLOWS. HE WAS FRAIL AND THIN, AND------ HIS SKIN HAD BECOME A DARKER YELLOW, BUT HIS SPIRITS WERE GOOD. HE SMILED------ WARMLY, GLAD TO BE WITH SO MANY OF HIS CLOSEST STUDENTS. HE HADN'T SEEN------ THEM MUCH IN THE PAST SIX WEEKS. THEY RE---------------TURNED HIS SMILES AND STOOD IN A SEMICIRCLE AROUND HIS BED. ON PAGE------ STREET CARS PASSED, AND BIRDS CHIRPED IN THE RUBBER TREE OUTSIDE THE------ WINDOW.------------- SUZUKI CLEARED HIS THROAT AND TURNED ON THE TAPE RECORDER. THEN HE------ SOFTLY TOLD THEM WHAT THEY FEARED TO HEAR.----------------------- AS YOU KNOW, MY DOCTOR THOUGHT I HAD HEPATITIS, BUT MY SYMPTOMS DIDN'T------ CHANGE FOR SUCH A LONG TIME, SO HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT NOT BE HEPATITIS------, MAYBE CANCER. SO I WENT INTO MT. ZION HOSPITAL AGAIN THREE DAYS AGO AND------ THEY CHECKED ME OUT-AND THE DOCTORS DISCUSSED MY ILLNESS. THE DAY BEFORE------ YESTERDAY MY DOCTOR CAME AND TOLD ME,----- "YOU HAVE CANCER.-----" AND HE------ EXPLAINED EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING. SO NOW I AM TELLING YOU.------------------------ SUZUKI IMMEDIATELY SET ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE AT EASE AND GIVING A------ POSITIVE SPIN TO THE NEWS. HE SPOKE AS IF IT WERE NO BIG DEAL, ADDING THAT------ IT WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO FIND OUT THAT HE HAD CANCER AND NOT HEPATITIS------, BECAUSE NOW HE COULD EAT AND DRINK WHATEVER HE WANTED, AND THEY COULD------ SHARE FOOD WITH HIM WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT CONTAGION.----------------------- I MYSELF SELFISHLY FEEL GOOD, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I AM VERY SORRY------ FOR YOU. BUT I THINK BUDDHA WILL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING, SO I WON'T WORRY------ TOO MUCH. HOW LONG I'LL LIVE I DON'T KNOW. NO ONE KNOWS ACTUALLY. I ASKED------ THE DOCTOR,----- "TWO YEARS?----------" "AT MOST,-----" HE SAID. I AM NOT------ SO SURE ABOUT IT. SO I WANT YOU TO BE PREPARED. IF I LIVE LONGER, IT IS------ BETTER, OF COURSE, FOR ME AND FOR YOU. I THINK I CAN LIVE ONE MORE YEAR------ FOR SURE, I FEEL THAT WAY. I DON'T FEEL SO DISCOURAGED OR WEAK. SO MAYBE I------ WANT YOU TO ALLOW ME TO BE A LAZY MONK, THAT'S ALL. I SHALL BE A VERY BAD------ EXAMPLE, BUT [LAUGHING] INSTEAD, YOU SHOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE. OKAY?------ THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT YOU TO DO-TO PREPARE. MOST THINGS YOU CAN DECIDE------ AMONG YOURSELVES. IF NECESSARY, I CAN JOIN YOUR DISCUSSIONS. PHYSICALLY, I------ GET TIRED QUITE EASILY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.------------------------ ABRUPTLY HE TURNED TO CLAUDE, THE OLDEST, WHOSE COUNSEL HE HAD VALUED------ SINCE THEY FIRST MET IN----------- "CLAUDE, I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE, EVEN------ THOUGH I AM NO MORE. OKAY? PLEASE.-----" CLAUDE, CORNERED, AFFIRMED THAT------ HE WOULD.----- "THANK YOU,-----" SUZUKI SAID, GOING ON TO MAKE------------- A POINT ABOUT THEIR ROLES AS PRIESTS AND ABOUT THE PRIEST'S------ RESPONSIBILITY WITHIN THE LARGER BUDDHIST COMMUNITY.----- "YOU SHOULDN'T------ FEEL YOU HAVE TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I DID, YOU KNOW. YOU ARE FREE TO DEVELOP------ OUR WAY AS PEOPLE WANT YOU TO DO. THAT IS THE BODHISATTVA IDEA.------------------" HE LEANED CLOSE TO THE MIKE WHEN HE SAID THIS. HE WAS SPEAKING TO------ RICHARD BAKER, FOR WHOM THE TAPE WAS BEING MADE. SUZUKI'S TONE OF VOICE------ SAID, YOU SHOULD COME BACK NOW AND ASSUME THIS RESPONSIBILITY. RICHARD AND------ SUZUKI HAD BEEN CORRESPONDING WITH YVONNE'S ASSISTANCE THROUGHOUT HIS STAY------ IN JAPAN. SINCE THE SPRING THERE HAD BEEN DISCUSSION OF RICHARD'S------ RETURNING IN THE FALL OR WINTER TO ASSUME SOME OF SUZUKI'S------ RESPONSIBILITIES. RICHARD HAD BEEN RESISTANT TO THE IDEA-HE DIDN'T FEEL------ READY FOR THAT. NOW SUZUKI WAS TWISTING HIS ARM.------------- AFTER SOME JOKING WITH HIS DISCIPLES, SUZUKI HAD THE TAPE REWOUND AND------ PLAYED. AT THE EXCHANGE WITH CLAUDE HE LISTENED CAREFULLY, STOPPED THE------ MACHINE, AND ACTED PLEASED THAT CLAUDE WAS ON TAPE SAYING HE WOULD STAY------, ALTHOUGH HIS ANSWER WAS FAIRLY INAUDIBLE. SUZUKI BOWED TO HIS CRESTFALLEN------ DISCIPLES AND THEY BOWED BACK, GOING OUT WITH TEARS IN-THEIR EYES TO SHARE ------THE TRAGIC NEWS WITH THE COMMUNITY.--------------------------------- THE DAY BEFORE, WHEN YVONNE HAD GONE TO THE HOSPITAL TO PICK UP SUZUKI------, SHE'D FOUND HIM SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED WITH LEGS DANGLING BELOW------ HIS HOSPITAL GOWN. OKUSAN WAS IN THE HALL SAYING GOODBYE TO SOME VISITORS.------ THE NURSE HAD JUST BROUGHT HIS LUNCH, AND HE PATTED THE BED AND MOTIONED------ TO YVONNE TO COME OVER. SHE KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP. HE SLOWLY MOUTHED THE------ WORDS,----- "I HAVE CANCER,-----" WITH A BIG GRIN ON HIS FACE. SHE WAS------ CONFUSED BECAUSE THE TWO THINGS DIDN'T GO TOGETHER-CANCER AND GRINNING.------ AS SHE SAT NEXT TO HIM, HE PULLED OVER THE FOOD TRAY.----- "I HAVE CANCER.------ THAT MEANS WE CAN EAT TOGETHER AGAIN.-----" HE TOOK A FORKFUL FROM HIS------ PLATE AND FED IT TO HER. YVONNE THREW HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND CRIED.------------------ "THIS CANCER IS MY FRIEND, AND MY PRACTICE WILL BE TO TAKE CARE OF------ THIS SICKNESS,-----" HE TOLD HER.----------------------------------------------------- DR. STUNKARD, WHO HAD FIRST REALIZED SUZUKI HAD-CANCER, TALKED TO HIM------ ABOUT GOING TO THE CUTTING-EDGE STANFORD CANCER UNIT, BUT SUZUKI DECIDED------ AGAINST IT, SAYING,----- "THIS DOCTOR IS MY DOCTOR, AND I HAVE TO RESPECT------ HIM. IT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE TO SEE ANOTHER DOCTOR.-----" STUNKARD------ TRIED TO TELL HIM THINGS WERE DIFFERENT IN AMERICA, BUT SUZUKI STOOD FIRM.------ AFTER TALKING FURTHER WITH HIS COLLEAGUES AT STANFORD, STUNKARD DECIDED------ THAT SUZUKI HAD MADE THE RIGHT DECISION. THE TYPE OF CANCER HE HAD WAS NOT------ RESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT, IT HAD SPREAD, AND RADIATION AND CHEMOTHERAPY------ WOULD JUST MAKE HIM SICKER.------------------ "YOU KNOW WE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT TEACHING IN THE PAST,-----" SUZUKI------ SAID TO STUNKARD.----- "SO MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF DYING.------ I CAN SHOW THEM THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE AFRAID OF DYING. IT'S A------ WONDERFUL TEACHING OPPORTUNITY.-----------------------" "I WISH YOU WERE DOING SOME OTHER KIND OF TEACHING,-----" STUNKARD------ SAID.------------------ "YES, I DON'T WANT TO DIE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT-IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE------ WHEN I DIE. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT'S GOING-TO BE LIKE. BUT WHEN-I DIE------, I'LL STILL BE-A BUDDHA. I MAY BE A-BUDDHA IN AGONY, OR I MAY BE A BUDDHA------ IN BLISS, BUT I'LL DIE KNOWING THAT THIS IS HOW IT IS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" W-----------------------------------------------HEREVER YOU GO YOU WILL------ FIND YOUR TEACHER, AS LONG AS------------- YOU HAVE THE EYES TO SEE AND THE EARS TO HEAR.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RYUHO CONTINUED TO DO SHIATSU------ ON SUZUKI EVERY DAY. HE CONCENTRATED ON POINTS IN SUZUKI'S BACK THAT------ CORRESPONDED TO THE LIVER. HE PRESSED HIS FEET AND LEGS AND ARMS. SUZUKI------ WAS WEAK BUT ALERT. IF RYUHO'S MIND WANDERED WHILE WORKING, SUZUKI WOULD------ IMMEDIATELY TELL HIM TO CONCENTRATE.------------------------------------------------------------ RYUHO WAS INTRIGUED BY THE------ PEOPLE WHO CAME TO SEE SUZUKI: DISCIPLES, STUDENTS, FRIENDS, SCHOLARS------, ARTISTS, TEACHERS, PRIESTS, MEMBERS OF THE JAPANESE CONGREGATION AT------ SOKOJI, OTHER BUDDHIST TEACH------------------------------------------------------------- ERS.------- THERE WAS MAEZUMI------, THE TEACHER OF THE L.A. ZEN CENTER, WHO'D KNOWN SUZUKI SINCE 1959, AND------ BISHOP SUMI FROM ZENSHUJI IN L.A. EIDO SHIMANO, NAKAGAWA'S DISCIPLE AND------ THE TEACHER AT THE ZEN STUDIES SOCIETY IN NEW YORK, DROPPED BY TO PAY HIS------ RESPECTS ONE DAY.------------- BOB HALPERN VISITED. HE HAD BEEN STUDYING WITH THE TIBETAN TEACHER------, TRUNGPA, IN BOULDER. ON SUZUKI'S BEDSIDE TABLE WAS A LARGE POSTCARD BOB------ HAD SENT. INSTEAD OF A NOTE, HE HAD DRAWN A PICTURE OF TRUNGPA'S ALTAR------, WHICH HAD A BUDDHA IN THE CENTER, TRUNGPA'S TIBETAN GURU ON THE LEFT, AND------ SUZUKI-ROSHI ON THE RIGHT. TRUNGPA CAME A FEW DAYS LATER. SUZUKI SPOKE TO------ HIM OPTIMISTICALLY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF BUDDHISM IN AMERICA. TRUNGPA SAT BY------ SUZUKI'S BED, HOLDING HIS HAND FOR OVER AN HOUR.------------- ALMOST EVERY DAY SOME OLD-TIMER WOULD ENTER SUZUKI'S ROOM AND STAY FOR------ HALF AN HOUR-BETTY, DELLA, JEAN, MIKE DIXON, AND OTHERS. SUZUKI HAD------ ASKED PHILIP TO COME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, AND HE WOULD DRIVE IN EVERY FEW------ DAYS FROM SANTA ROSA. OKUSAN TOLD PHILIP THAT SUZUKI SAID TO LET HIM IN------ ANY TIME HE CAME. PHILIP SAID HE'D BREAK DOWN THE DOOR IF HE COULDN'T GET------ IN.------------- GRAHAME SENT A LETTER FROM TOKYO EXPRESSING CONCERN AND SAYING THAT------ HE'D COME AS SOON AS HE COULD, IN LATE DECEMBER, WHEN HE WOULD BE VISITING------ PAULINE AND THE CHILDREN IN MILL VALLEY. HE WAS FULLY INVOLVED WITH THE------ ENGLISH LANGUAGE SCHOOL HE HAD STARTED AND COULD NOT GET AWAY UNTIL THEN.----------------------------------------------------- RYUHO STOOD BY AND LISTENED AS------ ALAN WATTS AND JANO PAID THEIR RESPECTS. HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY------ WERE SAYING, BUT IT WAS A LIVELY MEETING, CONSIDERING SUZUKI'S CONDITION.------ WATTS WAS IN FINE FORM. JANO TEASED HER HUSBAND, AND RYUHO WORRIED THAT------ SUZUKI WOULD DIE ON THE SPOT, HE WAS LAUGHING SO HARD.---------------------------------------- LOUISE BROUGHT HER NEWBORN DAUGHTER TO VISIT WEARING A TINY RAKUSU, THE------ LAST THAT SUZUKI HAD INSCRIBED. THE LITTLE ONE'S NAME WAS JOHANNA. SUZUKI------ WAS SITTING ON A LOW TABLE IN THE TATAMI ROOM. IN FRONT OF HIM WAS HIS------ WELL-WORN POCKET-SIZED DICTIONARY, BROUGHT FROM JAPAN AND OFTEN CARRIED------ BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TASSAJARA AND THE CITY. HE PICKED IT UP AND SAID,----------- "THIS WILL LIVE LONGER THAN I WILL.--------------------------------------" SUZUKI EXPRESSED GREAT REGRET OVER HIS CANCER.----- "BEFORE MY------ DISCIPLES ARE READY TO COME OUT OF THE OVEN, I WILL BE GOING INTO------ IT.-----" LOUISE WAS SURPRISED AT HIS SADNESS, BECAUSE SHE STILL HAD THE------ IDEA THAT A ZEN TEACHER WOULDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF FEELING.--------------------------------- SUZUKI TOLD BILL KWONG THE OPPOSITE, SAYING:----- "I'VE PUT MY COOKIES------ IN THE OVEN, THEY'VE COME OUT FINE, AND NOW I'M GOING TO CRAWL IN.-----------" HE'D SAY DIFFERENT THINGS AT DIFFERENT TIMES, BUT CLEARLY HE WAS THINKING------ ABOUT HIS DISCIPLES AND WHAT TO DO FOR THEM BEFORE HE DIED.------------- RICHARD BAKER WAS COMING BACK. THERE WAS GOING TO BE A CEREMONY TO MAKE------ HIM THE NEW ABBOT. PAGE STREET AND TASSAJARA WERE ABUZZ WITH TALK ABOUT------ IT. HOW COULD THIS BE? HE'D RECEIVED TRANSMISSION, BUT STILL, HOW COULD HE------ TAKE ON SUZUKI'S ROLE? WHAT ABOUT KATAGIRI? WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PRIESTS?------ WHAT ABOUT BILL KWONG, WHO'D BEEN WITH SUZUKI ALMOST FROM THE FIRST AND------ WHO HAD A ZENDO IN MILL VALLEY? WHAT ABOUT SILAS, WHO WAS GIVING LECTURES------, JEAN IN CARMEL VALLEY, MEL IN BERKELEY, AND OTHER DISCIPLES?------------- SUZUKI TOLD CLAUDE THAT HE WANTED TO GIVE TRANSMISSION TO A NUMBER OF------ HIS DISCIPLES BEFORE HE DIED. ESPECIALLY, HE EMPHASIZED, HE MUST COMPLETE------ BILL KWONG'S TRANSMISSION CEREMONY. BUT THERE WERE OTHERS. HE WAS THINKING------ OF GIVING TRANSMISSION TO SIX TO TWELVE DISCIPLES. HE WANTED TO ASK------ NOIRI-ROSHI TO COME OVER FROM JAPAN TO WORK WITH THESE STUDENTS FOR------ SEVERAL MONTHS IN PREPARATION FOR THE CEREMONY. CLAUDE ASKED WHAT WOULD BE------ THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RICHARD'S TRANSMISSION AND THESE, AND SUZUKI SAID,----------- "THEY WILL BE THE SAME AS RICHARD'S-NO DIFFERENCE.------------------" CLAUDE CONFERRED WITH A FEW PEOPLE, AND THEY ALL AGREED THAT SUZUKI WAS------ TOO ILL TO DO THIS. OKUSAN WAS ALSO OPPOSED TO HER HUSBAND'S PLAN. NOIRI------ NEEDED A SPECIAL DIET, AND SHE'D HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM BOTH, WHICH------ WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR HER. SUZUKI MADE IT CLEAR HOW MUCH HE WANTED TO DO------ IT, BUT OKUSAN TOLD HIM TO LEAVE IT TO RICHARD, WHO WAS COMING BACK AND------ COULD CARRY OUT SUZUKI'S WISHES. SHE AND CLAUDE AGREED; AND AFTER THEY------ TOLD SUZUKI HOW THEY FELT, HE GAVE UP AND DIDN'T MENTION IT AGAIN-NOT------ EVEN TO RICHARD.----------------------------------------------------- SUZUKI ASKED OKUSAN TO GO BACK TO JAPAN AFTER HE'D PASSED HIS AUTHORITY------ TO RICHARD IN THE MOUNTAIN SEAT CEREMONY. HE SAID HE WANTED TO DO------ SAITOKUDO, REORDINATION. SHE KNEW-THAT HE WANTED TO SPEND THE REMAINING------ TIME WITH HIS STUDENTS AND TO-LET THEM TAKE CARE OF HIM, TO BE AS CLOSE TO------ THEM AS POSSIBLE. HE'D READ A BOOK KATAGIRI HAD GIVEN HIM BY KODO SAWAKI------, WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY KATAGIRI'S SECOND TEACHER, EKO HASHIMOTO. IT------ STRESSED THAT PRIESTS SHOULD PRACTICE CELIBACY AND NOT LIVE WITH WOMEN. IT------ DIDN'T SEEM VERY PRACTICAL TO OKUSAN.------------- SHE SAID,----- "I'D COMPLY WITH YOUR WISH IF YOU WERE GETTING WELL, BUT------ I COULDN'T POSSIBLY LEAVE YOU IN THIS CONDITION. WHO WOULD COOK RICE GRUEL-------AND OTHER JAPANESE FOOD FOR YOU? YOU NEED SOMEONE-WHO CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR------ NEEDS BY A SINGLE WINK.------------------" SHE WROTE TO HOITSU IMMEDIATELY, AND HE WROTE RIGHT BACK, URGING HER TO------ STAY WITH HER HUSBAND BY ALL MEANS, OR THEY'D JUST HAVE TO SEND SOMEONE------ ELSE FROM THE FAMILY TO TAKE CARE OF HIM. HOITSU SENT A SIMILAR LETTER TO------ HIS FATHER. SO SUZUKI GAVE UP ON THAT IDEA TOO. ONE BY ONE HE HAD TO LET------ GO OF HIS WISHES.------------- WHEN HE HAD ENOUGH ENERGY-TO WALK DOWN THE STAIRS TO THE BASEMENT------, SUZUKI STILL WENT TO ZAZEN OCCASIONALLY. AFTERWARD HE COULDN'T GET BACK------ UP. HE WANTED TO MAKE IT ON HIS OWN BUT COULDN'T. SOMETIMES REB AND PETER------ WOULD MAKE A CHAIR OUT OF THEIR ARMS, AND HE'D SIT AND ENJOY THE RIDE. HE------ MADE IT FUN. HE WAS VERY SWEET ABOUT SUCH DEPENDENCE. HIS LIFE WAS NOT IN------ HIS OWN HANDS ANYMORE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Z-----------------------------------------------EN IS THE PRACTICE OF------ ALL EXISTENCE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE-STARS, MOON, SUN, MOUNTAINS,-RIVERS------, ANIMATE AND INANIMATE BEINGS. SOMETIMES THE PAIN IN OUR LEGS PRACTICES------ ZAZEN. SOMETIMES OUR SLEEPY MIND PRACTICES ZAZEN ON A BLACK CUSHION, ON A------ CHAIR, OR EVEN IN BED.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RICHARD BAKER RETURNED WITH VIRGINIA AND SALLY. AS SOON AS THEY------ ARRIVED, HE WENT TO SEE SUZUKI. SOON SUZUKI-ROSHI------------- WOULD PASS TO HIM THE ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY OF TAKING CARE OF ZEN------ CENTER AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAME THERE. HE WOULD BE THE CHIEF PRIEST.----------- "I'M SO SORRY FOR WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO TO YOU,-----" SUZUKI SAID TO------ HIM, TEARS FILLING HIS EYES.-------------------------------------- "HOW COULD SOMEONE WITH YOUR INTUITION CHOOSE TO MARRY SOMEONE AS------ DIFFICULT AS ME?-----" OKUSAN ASKED.------------------ "BECAUSE YOU ARE RIDICULOUSLY HONEST,-----" HE SAID.------------------ "WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN YOU DIE?-----" SHE ASKED HIM.------------------ "STAY HERE,-----" HE SAID.----- "DON'T GO BACK AT ALL.-----" HE------ SAID EVERYONE WOULD BE HAPPY IF SHE STAYED, THAT HER TEN YEARS IN AMERICA------ WOULD MAKE IT HARD FOR HER TO ADJUST TO RINSO-IN. BUT HOW COULD SHE BE------ HELPFUL AT ZEN CENTER? SHE WANTED TO KNOW.------------------ "YOU ARE FAIR IN YOUR DEALINGS WITH PEOPLE. IT WILL WORK OUT------ NATURALLY.-----------------------" "SHOULD I BECOME A NUN?-----------------------" "OH, THAT WOULD BE BEST.-----------------------" "I'M TOO OLD FOR THAT. MAYBE I'LL BE A MONK IN MY NEXT LIFE.------------------" THAT GOT HIM LAUGHING, WHICH STARTED HIM COUGHING. OKUSAN HELPED HIM------ OVER ONTO ALL FOURS SO SHE COULD POUND HIS BACK. HE STOPPED COUGHING.----------- "YOU'RE LUCKY YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU TO THE LAST------ MOMENT,-----" SHE SAID IN A TEASING VOICE.------------- SUZUKI RAISED A HAND IN A FAINT GASSHO. THEN HE FARTED LOUDLY.----------- "THAT'S FOR YOU,-----" HE SAID.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ N-----------------------------------------------IRVANA IS SEEING ONE------ THING THROUGH TO THE END.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- KNOWING THAT THEIR FATHER COULD PASS AWAY AT ANY TIME, SUZUKI'S------ DAUGHTER YASUKO AND SON HOITSU ARRIVED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE STATES------ WITH GODFATHER AMANO, TO SAY THEIR FAREWELLS. THEY WERE SHOCKED TO SEE HIM------ SO JAUNDICED AND WEAK. THEY STOOD AT HIS BED SAYING A FEW POLITE PHRASES------, NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO. BUT SU---------------ZUKI WAS MORE OPEN AND EASYGOING THAN IN THE OLD DAYS, AND BEFORE LONG------ THEY WERE TALKING COMFORTABLY WITH HIM AND AMONG THEMSELVES. OKUSAN WAS------ MAKING NOODLES IN THE CRAMPED KITCHEN. THEN PHILIP, A FAMILIAR FACE, CAME------ TO VISIT.------------- AT PAGE STREET, AND LATER AT TASSAJARA, HIS CHILDREN WITNESSED WITH------ AMAZEMENT WHAT SUZUKI HAD ACCOMPLISHED IN HIS TWELVE YEARS-IN THE STATES.------ IT WAS HARD FOR YASUKO-AND HOITSU TO IMAGINE THAT THEIR FATHER WAS-A------ DHARMA TEACHER WITH MANY DISCIPLES--AND THAT A BOOK OF HIS LECTURES WAS------ SELLING WELL. THEY WERE IMPRESSED THAT EVERYONE CALLED HIM ROSHI AND------ AMAZED TO HEAR FROM AMERICANS SUCH ENTHUSIASTIC PRAISE FOR HIS LECTURES.----------- "MOTHER ALWAYS SAID HIS PROBLEM WAS THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO------ LECTURE ABOUT BUDDHISM, THAT HE DIDN'T EXPRESS HIMSELF WELL ENOUGH-----------," HOITSU SAID. THEIR FATHER HAD HARDLY EVER SAID ANYTHING TO THEM ABOUT------ BUDDHISM, SO THEY DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF HIM AS SOMEONE WITH A PARTICULARLY------ GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF IT. BUT THE EVIDENCE OF HIS EFFORT LAY BEFORE THEIR------ EYES.------------- YASUKO, HOITSU, AND GODFATHER AMANO ARRIVED AT TASSAJARA IN TIME TO------ ATTEND BILL KWONG'S HEAD MONK CEREMONY, AT WHICH KATAGIRI OFFICIATED. ONE------ AFTER ANOTHER THE AMERICAN STUDENTS PUT THEIR HANDS IN GASSHO AND-ASKED------ THE HEAD MONK QUESTIONS ABOUT DHARMA AND LIFE. HOITSU COULDN'T BELIEVE------ WHAT HE WAS SEEING AND GOT TEARY-THEY WERE DOING THE CEREMONY SINCERELY------, SPONTANEOUSLY, AND IN GOOD FORM.--------------------------------- I CAME UP FROM TASSAJARA TO PAY A VISIT TO MY DYING TEACHER. RICHARD------ ANSWERED THE DOOR. I'D ALREADY SPENT TIME WITH RICHARD AT TASSAJARA, SO WE------ JUST GREETED EACH OTHER BRIEFLY.----- "RIGHT NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO SEE------ ROSHI,-----" HE TOLD ME. KNOWING ME WELL, RICHARD WAS QUITE FIRM ABOUT THE------ TIME LIMIT.----- "DON'T SPEND ANY LONGER THAN FIVE MINUTES UNLESS------ SUZUKI-ROSHI ABSOLUTELY INSISTS THAT YOU STAY LONGER.-----------------------" "OKAY, I PROMISE,-----" I TOLD HIM.------------- AFTER I'D PUT ON MY ROBES I WENT TO HIS ROOM. OKUSAN LED ME INTO THE------ BEDROOM AND DIRECTED ME TO A CHAIR NEXT TO HIS BED. SUZUKI LOOKED UP AND------ SMILED. WE BOWED. HE LOOKED TERRIBLE. WITH SOME DIFFICULTY HE PULLED------ HIMSELF UP AND SAT ON THE EDGE OF THE BED, CLOSE------------- TO ME. THEN HE SLAPPED HIS THIGHS LIKE HE'D DO TO INDICATE PLEASURE. I------ JUST SAT THERE MOPING.----- "I FEEL FINE,-----" HE SAID.----- "I DON'T------ FEEL SO SERIOUS.-----" THAT WAS ALL I NEEDED.----- "OKAY,-----" I SAID------ SNAPPING OUT OF IT.------------- HE ASKED ME WHAT I WAS DOING AT TASSAJARA, AND I SAID I WAS THE------ ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. HE ACTED IMPRESSED. THEN HE GAVE ME A LITTLE ADVICE.------ HE SAID THAT, AS A PRIEST, I SHOULD HAVE TWO SPECIALTIES,-ONE PRIMARY AND------ ONE SECONDARY. MY-FIRST ONE, HE SAID, SHOULD BE TO TAKE CARE OF GUESTS------, SOMETHING I'D DONE SINCE TASSAJARA OPENED. AND THE SECOND ONE COULD------ POSSIBLY BE SCHOLARSHIP. HIS POINT WASN'T TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO. HE------ TRUSTED THAT MY SENIORS AT ZEN CENTER AND I WOULD WORK OUT THE DETAILS ON------ OUR OWN. IT DIDN'T MATTER TO HIM SO MUCH WHAT I-DID, I THINK, BUT HE-KNEW------ I NEEDED SOME WHOLESOME ACTIVITY TO BE ENGAGED IN THROUGH THE YEARS THAT------ WOULD BOTH EXPRESS MY TRUE NATURE AND KEEP ME OUT OF TROUBLE.------------- I WAS TOUCHED BY HIS CONCERN. HERE HE WAS WASTING AWAY, AND ALL HIS------ ATTENTION WAS ON ANOTHER, GIVING ME A BOOST, CONSPIRING WITH ME TO THE END------ TO HAVE FAITH IN MYSELF.------------- WE TALKED A WHILE LONGER AND THEN I SAID I HAD TO GO.----- "NO, NO------, STAY,-----" HE-SAID. I REMEMBERED WHAT RICHARD HAD SAID, AND I ALSO------ THOUGHT SUZUKI SHOULD LIE DOWN AND REST, SO-I STOOD UP AND BOWED. THEN HE------ SAID,----- "IF YOU LEAVE I WILL BE UNHAPPY. IF YOU STAY I WILL BE-------HAPPY.----------" "OKAY,-----" I SAID. HE ASKED ME IF I'D MET HIS FAMILY-------AND I SAID YES, THAT-I'D SHOWN THEM AROUND TASSAJARA. SO HE CALLED THEM------ ALL IN AND WE TALKED AND VISITED FOR HALF AN HOUR. IT WAS LOTS OF FUN, AND------ I COMPLETELY FORGOT THAT SUZUKI WAS DYING AND THIS WAS THE LAST TIME WE------ WOULD MEET. I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER SAYING GOODBYE TO HIM.-------------------------------------- "WITH THESE HANDS I HAVE DONE MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE,-----" SUZUKI------ TOLD HOITSU.----- "I NEVER IMAGINED ALL THE THINGS I WOULD DO WITH THESE------ HANDS IN AMERICA. NOW MY WORK IS ALMOST FINISHED. IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GO------ BACK TO JAPAN AND DIE THERE.-----------------------" "WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO BACK TO JAPAN WITH ME?-----" HOITSU ASKED.------------------ "I WILL CRAWL IF NECESSARY,-----" HIS FATHER ANSWERED.------------- HOITSU WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR HIS FATHER SAY THAT. SINCE HIS THIRD YEAR------ IN AMERICA IT HAD SEEMED THAT HE WOULD NEVER RETURN. SEEING------------- HIS TWO ELDEST CHILDREN AND AMANO MUST HAVE AWAKENED A NOSTALGIA FOR------ HIS HOMELAND. THE CEREMONY WAS A WEEK OFF. THEY COULD BRING SUZUKI BACK------ WITH THEM RIGHT AFTER THAT. HOITSU TALKED TO OKUSAN, YASUKO, AND AMANO;------ WITH HELP FROM OKUSAN, HE TALKED TO SUZUKI'S DOCTOR, WHO SAID SUZUKI COULD------ DO IT. HOITSU WENT TO TELL HIS FATHER.------------------ "MASTER, THE DOCTOR SAID YOU CAN COME BACK WITH US.------------------" SUZUKI LOOKED UP AT HOITSU AND LAUGHED.----- "ISN'T IT OBVIOUS THERE'S------ NO WAY I COULD LEAVE HERE? CAN'T YOU PEOPLE EVEN TAKE A JOKE?-----------------------" "YOU WERE JUST TELLING US WHAT WE WANTED TO HEAR,-----" HOITSU------ SAID.------------------ "YES, OF COURSE. I WILL BECOME AMERICAN SOIL.--------------------------------------" YASUKO SAW HER FATHER IN A NEW LIGHT IN AMERICA. PUTTING A POSITIVE------ SPIN ON HIS MISFORTUNE, HE TOLD HER HE'D LIVED LONGER THAN HE'D EXPECTED------, THAT HIS MASTER SO-ON HAD DIED AT THE AGE OF FIFTY-FIVE, HE WAS NOW------ SIXTY-SEVEN. THE TWELVE EXTRA YEARS WERE HIS TIME IN AMERICA. (SUZUKI'S------ CHRONOLOGICAL ACCURACY WAS SOMETIMES OFF-SO-ON ACTUALLY DIED WHEN HE WAS------ FIFTY-SEVEN.) HE WAS THIN, SOFT, AND OPEN TO HER. SHE'D NEVER FELT CLOSER------ TO HIM AND WAS SORRY SHE'D SEEN SO LITTLE OF HIM SINCE HE LEFT JAPAN. SHE------ COULD FINALLY FORGIVE HIM FOR THE DEATH OF HER MOTHER AND SAW HIS------ ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN AMERICA NOT ONLY AS ATONEMENT FOR BUT AS PARTIALLY------ MOTIVATED BY HER DEATH.------------- SHE THOUGHT OF THE TIME IN THE FIFTH GRADE WHEN HE'D TAKEN HER TO------ SHIZUOKA CITY AND, EMBARRASSED TO BE SEEN WITH HIM, SHE'D WALKED ON THE------ OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. SHE DIDN'T FEEL THAT GAP NOW.------------------ "THE BOND BETWEEN CHILDREN AND PARENTS IS NEVER LOST,-----" HE------ TOLD HER.--------------------------------- GODFATHER AMANO FELT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE PURPOSE OF HIS TRIP. HE------ HAD SEEN SUZUKI, HIS TEMPLES, HIS STUDENTS. HE COULD SEE THAT SUZUKI WAS------ GOING TO DIE.----- "I'D BETTER GO BACK NOW,-----" HE SAID. HE TOO HAD------ CANCER AND TROUBLE WITH HIS BOWELS; AND THOUGH HE WASN'T DYING OR SICK------ LIKE HIS OLD FRIEND, IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO STAY. BUT SUZUKI WANTED------ HIM TO WITNESS RICHARD'S MOUNTAIN SEAT CEREMONY.------------------ "FATHER,-----" SUZUKI SAID TO HIM,----- "THERE IS ONE MORE------ IMPORTANT JOB I------------- NEED TO DO AS A MONK. PLEASE SEE IT AND REPORT IT TO THE MEMBERSHIP AT------ RINSO-IN. TELL THEM WHAT I HAVE DONE SINCE I LEFT THEM AND CAME------ HERE.-----------------------" "FATHER, PLEASE FULFILL HOJO'S WISHES,-----" SAID OKUSAN.------------- FINALLY AMANO AGREED TO STAY.--------------------------------- IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT EVERY DAY FOR SUZUKI TO TALK, BUT HE COULD DO IT------, ESPECIALLY WITH OKUSAN, WITH WHOM HE COULD COMMUNICATE WITH MUCH LESS------ EFFORT.----- "I WON'T INTERFERE WITH ZEN CENTER AT ALL ONCE I HAVE HANDED------ IT OVER TO RICHARD. IT'S ENTIRELY UP TO HIM WHETHER IT WILL BE RUINED OR------ NOT,-----" SUZUKI SAID TO HIS WIFE. HE EVEN TOLD HER AND RICHARD THAT HE------ DIDN'T WANT ANY MORE JAPANESE PRIESTS TO COME TO ZEN CENTER AS TEACHERS.----------- "FROM NOW ON, THEY SHOULD COME AS STUDENTS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" T-----------------------------------------------HE MOST IMPORTANT POINT------ IS TO CONTINUE OUR WAY------------- AND TO HAVE A GOOD SUCCESSOR.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ON SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 21, AT TEN IN THE MORNING, THE HALLS AND COURTYARD------ OF ZEN CENTER WERE FILLED WITH PEOPLE TALKING SOFTLY AND WAITING. THEY HAD------ COME FOR THE MOUNTAIN SEAT CEREMONY IN WHICH RICHARD BAKER WAS TO BE------ INSTALLED AS THE CHIEF PRIEST OF ZEN CENTER. THE FOYER AND HALLWAY WERE------ LINED WITH ROWS OF CHAIRS. THE BUDDHA HALL, WHERE THE CEREMONY WAS TO TAKE------ PLACE, WAS TOO SMALL FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED GUESTS. CHINESE, TIBETAN, AND------ JAPANESE PRIESTS OF VARIOUS SECTS ATTENDED WITH SOME OF THEIR DISCIPLES.------ MANY OF THE KEY FIGURES IN SUZUKI'S LIFE IN AMERICA WERE THERE: WAKO AND------ EMI KATO, REVEREND OGUI, GEORGE HAGIWARA, AND MANY FROM THE JAPANESE------ CONGREGATION OF SOKOJI. BILL MCNEIL STOOD IN A CORNER IN A LEATHER JACKET;------ POETS AND ARTISTS FROM THE OLD BEAT DAYS CAME IN THE FRONT DOOR. SO MANY------ PEOPLE WHO HAD BECOME DEEPLY------------- CONNECTED IN THE PAST TWELVE YEARS, SO MANY STORIES LIKE FIBERS RUNNING------ AMONG THEM, SO MANY FOR WHOM SUZUKI HAD OPENED DHARMA GATES OR BEEN THERE------ WITH A NUDGE WHEN THEIR LIVES TURNED.------------- THE BELL DOWNSTAIRS WAS BEING STRUCK EVERY MINUTE, INFORMING THE CROWD------ THAT IT WAS TIME TO SETTLE DOWN. PEOPLE PATIENTLY SAT OR STOOD WHERE THEY------ WERE. THEY COULD HEAR A PROCESSION MOVING FROM KATAGIRI'S APARTMENT UP THE------ STREET, INTO THE BUILDING, AND TO ITS VARIOUS ALTARS. THE RUMBLE OF THE------ DEEP BUDDHA DRUM ECHOED IN THE HALLS-THE HIGH--- CHIN-CHUN----! OF------ HANDHELD BELLS A HALF-TONE APART AND THE--- KACHIN----! OF WOODEN------ CLACKERS, THE MUSIC OF THE MOVING RITE. ON THE SECOND FLOOR THE PROCESSION------ STOPPED OUTSIDE SUZUKI'S ROOM, WHERE RICHARD OFFERED INCENSE AND SAID:----------- "ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAME, THROUGH YOUR HEART-TEACHING I AM------ ALWAYS HERE.------------------" KATAGIRI-ROSHI, KOBUN-SENSEI, AND A FEW OF SUZUKI'S SENIOR MONKS------ ACCOMPANIED RICHARD DOWN THE STAIRS TO THE HUSHED BUDDHA HALL. RICHARD------ WORE A BLUE AND GOLD ROBE WITH BRIGHT-COLORED FLYING PHOENIXES, WHICH------ SUZUKI HAD GIVEN HIM FOR THIS DAY. HE CARRIED A CEREMONIAL HORSEHAIR------ WHISK.------------- THE ASSEMBLED CROWD WAS UTTERLY HUSHED WHEN THE SPINE-CHILLING SOUND OF------ INTERMITTENT THUDS AND JANGLING BELLS JOLTED EVERYONE TO ATTENTION. SUZUKI------ WAS WALKING WITH THE STAFF ALAN WATTS HAD GIVEN HIM. AFFIXED TO THE TOP------ WAS A BRONZE HEADPIECE WITH RINGS. AT HIS SIDES WERE HOITSU AND OKUSAN.------ THEY HELPED HIM DOWN THE STAIRS AND PAST THOSE SEATED AND STANDING ALONG------ THE WAY, TO THE DOUBLE DOORS OF THE BUDDHA HALL. WITH EACH STEP HE STRUCK------ THE FLOOR WITH HIS STAFF, AS IF CONTINUING TO PLANT THE DHARMA IN AMERICA.------ THERE HE WAS, HIS REDDISH-BROWN OKESA DRAPING OVER A YELLOW KOROMO. ALL------ EYES WERE ON HIM. MANY PEOPLE HADN'T SEEN HIM IN HIS ILLNESS, AND EVEN TO------ THOSE WHO HAD, HIS APPEARANCE WAS CRUSHING. HE WAS SO DARK, WEAK, AND------ SHRUNKEN. YET AS HE MOVED INTO THE BUDDHA HALL TOWARD THE SPECIALLY BUILT------ MOUNTAIN SEAT ALTAR, HIS ENORMOUS EFFORT AND DIGNITY SHONE THROUGH.------------- REACHING THE BROCADE-COVERED ALTAR, STILL SUPPORTED ON BOTH SIDES, HE------ SLOWLY PULLED OUT FROM THE SLEEVE OF HIS ROBE A BOWING CLOTH. GATHERING------ HIS STRENGTH, HE LAID IT OUT PROPERLY, BOWED DOWN TO THE------------- FLOOR, AND ROSE, SOMEHOW, DRAWING STRENGTH FROM THE DEPTH OF HIS WILL------, CALM AND POWERFUL, THE WAY FRAIL OLD KITANO-ROSHI HAD RISEN FROM HIS BOWS------ AT EIHEIJI, AMAZING AND INSPIRING THE YOUNG SUZUKI. HOITSU HELPED HIM TO A------ CUSHIONED CEREMONIAL CHAIR TO THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR. HE SAT AND LOOKED------ WITH EYES STRAIGHT AHEAD YET DOWNCAST, AS IN ZAZEN.------------- PEOPLE WERE JUST CATCHING THEIR BREATH WHEN RICHARD BAKER STEPPED------ FORWARD. AFTER THE--- HEART SUTRA---- WAS RECITED, RICHARD STOOD BEFORE------ THE MOUNTAIN SEAT ALTAR AND SAID IN CLASSICAL STYLE:----- "THIS MOUNTAIN------ SEAT, CLIMBED MANY TIMES BEFORE, IS THE EVERYWHERE BODHIMANDALA. WITH THE------ HELP OF MY MASTER AND EVERYONE HERE, IN THE TEN DIRECTIONS AND THE THREE------ TIMES, I WILL CLIMB THIS MIND-SEAL ALTAR. DO NOT WONDER ABOUT IT AT------ ALL.------------------" HE OFFERED INCENSE TO BUDDHAS, BODHISATTVAS, AND ANCESTORS, TO TRUDY------ DIXON, KATAGIRI-ROSHI, AND----- "TO MY OWN SUBTLE AND COMPASSIONATE------ TEACHER, SUZUKI SHUNRYU-DAIOSHO,-----" TO WHOM HE SAID, DRAWING FROM------ SUZUKI'S OWN MOUNTAIN SEAT CEREMONY AT SOKOJI IN 1962:------------- THIS PIECE OF INCENSE------------- WHICH I HAVE HAD FOR A LONG LONG TIME------------- I OFFER WITH NO-HAND------------- TO MY MASTER, TO MY FRIEND, SUZUKI SHUNRYU-DAIOSHO,------------- THE FOUNDER OF THESE TEMPLES.------------- THERE IS NO MEASURE OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.------------- WALKING WITH YOU IN BUDDHA'S GENTLE RAIN------------- OUR ROBES ARE SOAKED THROUGH,------------- BUT ON THE LOTUS LEAVES------------- NOT A DROP REMAINS.------------- RICHARD SAT ON A RED LACQUERED CHAIR BEFORE THE ALTAR. KATAGIRI SPOKE------ FOR SUZUKI LOUD AND CLEAR:----- "DRAGONS AND ELEPHANTS! ACCEPT THIS HOLDER------ OF BUDDHA'S FIRST SEAT------------------!" THEN RICHARD BAKER SAID, IN WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE FIRST LECTURE OF HIS------ ABBOTSHIP,----- "THERE IS NOTHING TO BE SAID.------------------" A--- MONDO---- FOLLOWED, RITUALIZED YET IMPROMPTU QUESTIONS, WHICH------------- RICHARD ANSWERED QUICKLY AND DRAMATICALLY. TELEGRAMS WERE READ, FORMAL------ CONGRATULATIONS WERE MADE, AND THE CEREMONY WAS OVER.------------- SUZUKI WAS HELPED TO FACE THE ALTAR, WHERE HE MADE ANOTHER SLOW------, PAINFUL PROSTRATION FROM WHICH HE ROSE ALMOST BY HIMSELF. THEN HE STARTED------ DOWN THE AISLE TO LEAVE. HALFWAY TO THE OPENED DOORWAY HE STOPPED IN THE------ MIDST OF HIS SANGHA, DISCIPLES, STUDENTS, FORMER STUDENTS, ADMIRERS, OLD------ FRIENDS, VISITING TEACHERS, AND GUESTS. THERE WAS UTTER SILENCE. HE LOOKED------ TO THE LEFT, THEN DECISIVELY ROLLED THE STAFF SEVERAL TIMES BETWEEN HIS------ HANDS; THE RINGS AT THE TOP BURST OUT JANGLING. HE LOOKED TO THE RIGHT AND------ ROLLED HIS STAFF AGAIN, AND AGAIN THE RINGS RANG OUT. IT WAS THE SOUND OF------ AN ULTIMATE EFFORT. IT WAS THE SOUND OF HIS LOVE AND HIS FREEDOM.------------- TEARS AND SOBBING BEGAN ON ALL SIDES. HEARTS CRACKED OPEN. EVERYTHING------ WAS SUSPENDED IN HIS PRESENCE, IN AN IMMENSE SHARED FEELING-A CAR------ HONKING ON THE STREET, PIGEONS COOING, THE CRYING IN THE ROOM, AND A DEEP------ STILLNESS. TIME STOPPED. A MOMENT THAT STARTED THE DAY HE ARRIVED IN------ AMERICA CONTINUED AS HE WAS HELPED OUT OF THE ROOM, STRIKING HIS STAFF TO------ THE FLOOR AS HE WENT. HE LEFT BEHIND HIM A ROOM FULL OF PALMS PRESSED------ TOGETHER SAYING THANK YOU, SAYING GOODBYE, SAYING WHAT COULD NOT BE SAID.--------------------------------- AFTER THE CEREMONY, SUZUKI MET WITH HIS DISCIPLES. TWENTY OR SO SAT ON------ THE TATAMI IN HIS SITTING ROOM. IT WAS DONE. HE'D PASSED ON ZEN CENTER------, PAGE STREET, AND TASSAJARA TO ZENTATSU RICHARD BAKER, WHO SAT NEXT TO HIM------ A HEAD HIGHER IN HIS FANCY ROBES, HIS EYES DOWN, THE WEIGHT OF WHAT HE'D------ RECEIVED ALL OVER HIM. SUZUKI TURNED TO HIM, NODDED, AND SMILED. THE ROOM------ WAS HUSHED. IN A FAINT VOICE SUZUKI SAID THANK YOU TO EVERYONE AND TO------ RICHARD AND THEN, NODDING TOWARD KATAGIRI, ANOTHER BREATHY THANK YOU----------- "FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE, FOR WHICH I AM SO GRATEFUL.-----" ALL OF A------ SUDDEN A HOWL AROSE. IT WAS KATAGIRI WHO CRAWLED TOWARD SUZUKI CRYING OUT,----------- "DON'T DIE-----!" SOBBING, HE HUGGED FRAIL SUZUKI, WHO SAID IN A SOFT------ RASP,----- "DAIJOBU. DAIJOBU-----" (IT'S ALL RIGHT).----------------------------------------------------- KATAGIRI HAD SAID GOODBYE TO SUZUKI AND WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO------ TASSAJARA FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF THE PRACTICE PERIOD. HE LEFT IN------ SADNESS AND WITH SOME DISCOMFORT AT HIS SITUATION. SEVEN YEARS HE'D SERVED------ SUZUKI-HARD WORK, LOW PAY, NO TIME OFF. KATAGIRI WAS DEPENDABLE AND HAD------ A SEAMLESS CONSTANT PRACTICE. HE'D COME TO BE SEEN AS A COTEACHER BY MANY.------ SUZUKI AND KATAGIRI HAD CONTAINED THEIR FEELINGS, SPEAKING LITTLE THROUGH------ THE YEARS. UNTIL THE MEETING WITH HIS DISCIPLES FOLLOWING RICHARD'S------ MOUNTAIN SEAT CEREMONY, SUZUKI HAD NEVER VERBALLY EXPRESSED HIS GRATITUDE.------------- SUZUKI WAS STILL TROUBLED BY KATAGIRI'S INTENTION TO LEAVE. HE WANTED------ HIM TO REMAIN A SENIOR DHARMA TEACHER FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY.----- "MAYBE------ KATAGIRI CAN STILL HELP,-----" HE SAID TO OKUSAN AS HE WENT TO SLEEP.------------- KATAGIRI WASN'T THE ONLY PERSON HE HAD TROUBLED THOUGHTS ABOUT.------ UNFINISHED BUSINESS PRESSED AT SUZUKI. BILL. SILAS. HE WANTED TO TAKE CARE------ OF HIS DISCIPLES. SUZUKI'S STYLE WAS TO LET THINGS HAPPEN, NUDGING THEM------, PATIENTLY WAITING, ACTING SKILLFULLY BY NOT ACTING RASHLY. HE HADN'T KNOWN------ HOW QUICKLY HIS ILLNESS WOULD OVERCOME HIM. SOME DISCIPLES WERE DISTURBED.------ A FEW HAD POSTPONED OR GIVEN UP CAREERS TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO STUDYING------ WITH THIS DYING MAN. WOULD HE LEAVE NO FINAL INSTRUCTIONS?------------- SO FAR SUZUKI'S INSTRUCTIONS WERE NOT ABOUT PRACTICAL MATTERS BUT ABOUT------ DYING WITH DIGNITY. IT WAS TRAGIC FOR HIS STUDENTS TO SEE THE------ DETERIORATING PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THEIR DEAR TEACHER, YET AT THE SAME------ TIME IT WAS MARVELOUS TO WITNESS HIS COMPOSURE AND SEE HOW UNDIMINISHED HE------ WAS AT HEART.--------------------------------- IN HIS LAST MEETING WITH HOITSU BEFORE HIS SON RETURNED TO JAPAN------, SUZUKI IMPLORED,----- "TAKE CARE OF BILL KWONG FOR ME. MAKE SURE BILL GETS------ TRANSMISSION-YOU CAN DO IT FOR ME.------------------" SUZUKI WANTED HOITSU TO BE AVAILABLE TO HELP HIS DISCIPLES IN WHATEVER------ WAY HE COULD, BUT HOITSU KNEW HIS FATHER DIDN'T WANT HIM TO INTERFERE WITH------ RICHARD.----- "LEAVE ZEN CENTER TO RICHARD,-----" HE'D SAID SEVERAL TIMES.------ HOITSU ALSO KNEW THAT LEADERS NEED ASSISTANCE, AND HIS FATHER KNEW IT TOO.------ RICHARD WOULD NEED HELP FROM HIS ELDERS, LIKE------------- KATAGIRI AND CLAUDE, AND FROM HIS PEERS, LIKE BILL AND SILAS. EVEN IF------ HE DISAGREED WITH THEM, HE SHOULD WORK WITH AND RESPECT THEM. SUZUKI KNEW------ THERE WAS RIVALRY BUT HOPED IT COULD MOVE TOWARD COOPERATION.----- "IT IS------ DONE,-----" HE SAID TO HIS SON.----- "ALL I CAN DO NOW IS HOPE.------------------" WITH THE TRUST HE HAD IN RICHARD AND IN OTHERS, AND CONSIDERING HIS------ PATIENCE AND ACCEPTANCE OF PROBLEMS, SUZUKI'S HOPE MIGHT HAVE INCLUDED------ MORE POSSIBILITIES THAN WERE IMAGINED BY HIS STUDENTS. IF SOME DISCIPLES------ COULDN'T WORK TOGETHER, MAYBE THEY COULD WORK SEPARATELY. IF THERE WERE------ SHARP DIFFERENCES, MAYBE TIME WOULD SMOOTH THE EDGES. ULTIMATELY, IF------ PEOPLE WERE SINCERE, IT WOULD BE OKAY. HE MIGHT HAVE LOOKED AT HIS------ STUDENTS THROUGH HIS DYING EYES AND THOUGHT, AS WHEN TATSUGAMI LANDED,----------- "YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO SUFFER.--------------------------------------" AMANO CAME TO HIS BEDSIDE TO SAY GOODBYE.----- "I'VE FINISHED ALL MY------ DUTIES,-----" SUZUKI TOLD HIM.----- "PLEASE REPORT THE DETAILS TO THE------ MEMBERS.-----------------------" "HAI,-----" AMANO ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.------------- SUZUKI GAVE AMANO HIS MALA BRACELET WITH THE SKULL-SHAPED BEADS. HE------ TOLD OKUSAN TO ROLL UP A SCROLL FOR YASUKO AND TO GIVE HOITSU THE STAFF------ WITH THE BRONZE RINGS HE'D CARRIED IN THE CEREMONY. THE CLANGER ON TOP OF------ THE STAFF WAS THE LAST ITEM HE WANTED TO RETURN TO RINSO-IN, OF THOSE HE------ HAD BORROWED WHEN HE'D LEFT IN------------------------ "WELL, WE'RE LEAVING NOW,-----" SAID AMANO.------------------ "OKAY. GOODBYE, FATHER. HAVE A GOOD TRIP,-----" SUZUKI SAID------ SOFTLY.------------- HOITSU COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW CASUALLY THE TWO SAID FAREWELL, AS IF IT------ WERE JUST ANOTHER DAY.------------- SITTING ON THE PLANE BEFORE TAKEOFF, YASUKO WAS CRYING. SHE WANTED TO------ GET OFF AND STAY WITH HER FATHER. HOITSU TOLD HER THEY HAD TO GO BACK NOW------ TO HELP AMANO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHAT THEIR FATHER HAD BEEN DOING IN------ AMERICA THESE TWELVE YEARS, WHAT HE HAD CREATED AND WAS LEAVING BEHIND.------ NOBODY HAD REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHY HE LEFT. NOW AMANO, YASUKO, AND HOITSU------ KNEW AND COULD TELL THE OTHERS, WHO SHOULD FEEL SOME PRIDE IN THIS TOO.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- T-----------------------------------------------HE ANCIENT BODHISATTVAS------ WERE NOT AFRAID OF, BUT FOUND JOY IN FAILURE, POVERTY, AND DEATH-AND IN------ DOING SMALL THINGS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A HOSPITAL BED WAS PUT IN A SECOND-FLOOR ROOM OVERLOOKING THE------ COURTYARD. THERE SUZUKI COULD HAVE A SENSE OF THE RHYTHM OF THE BUILDING------ AND SOME TIME IN THE SUNLIGHT. THE BUDDHA HALL WAS RIGHT BELOW; DURING------ MORNING SERVICE HE'D LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF CHANTING, DRUMS, AND BELLS------ COMING THROUGH THE WINDOW AND THE OPEN DOOR. OKUSAN WOULD WASH HIS FACE------, AND HE'D HAVE A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE-THAT WAS HIS SERVICE. HE WAS TOO------ WEAK TO GET OUT OF BED.----------------------------------------------------- RYUHO WOULD GET LOST LOOKING AT------ SUZUKI'S FACE AS HE GAVE HIM SHIATSU TREATMENTS. IT WAS SPACY AND------ CHANGING, HE SAID, AND IT DIDN'T LOOK JAPANESE. HE COULD OBVIOUSLY DIE AT------ ANY TIME-OKUSAN AND THE DOCTOR SAID SO, TOO. HIS SKIN WAS DARK, ALMOST------ THE COLOR OF THE BROWN OKESA ROBE. BUT TO RYUHO THE LIGHT OF HIS EYES WAS------ POWERFUL.-------------------- YVONNE WAS THERE EVERY DAY, STAYING WITH HIM WHILE OKUSAN COOKED, DID------ LAUNDRY, AND CLEANED. THEY TOOK TURNS CARING FOR HIM AND MASSAGING HIS------ BACK, LEGS, ARMS-WHEREVER HE'D INDICATE. YVONNE WOULD BE SITTING BY HIS------ BED AND A SKINNY ARM WOULD COME OUT FROM THE COVERS AND GO INTO THE AIR.------ SHE'D RUB IT FOR A WHILE; THEN HE'D PULL IT BACK UNDER THE COVERS. LATER------ THE OTHER ARM WOULD APPEAR. SHE AND OKUSAN MASSAGED AND MOVED HIM ENOUGH------ SO THAT HE HADN'T GOTTEN ANY BEDSORES. HE NEVER COMPLAINED AND ALWAYS------ APPRECIATED THE ATTENTION HE RECEIVED.------------- THERE WAS A BOTTLE OF PAINKILLERS ON THE TABLE. HE REFUSED THEM, AS------ AFTER THE GALLBLADDER OPERATION. HE HAD TRIED THEM ONCE BECAUSE HIS DOCTOR------ TOLD HIM TO, BUT HE DIDN'T LIKE THE STATE OF MIND THAT RESULTED, SO HE------ ASKED YVONNE TO TAKE THEM AWAY. STILL, HE TOLD RICHARD THAT SOMETIMES HE------ FELT LIKE HE WAS BEING TORTURED.------------- ONE DAY SUZUKI ASKED YVONNE TO COME CLOSE TO HIM, AND WHEN------------- SHE DID HE APOLOGIZED FOR NOT HAVING ORDAINED HER AS A PRIEST, SAYING------ AGAIN THAT HE LACKED CONFIDENCE IN TRAINING WOMEN.----- "I DIDN'T------ RECOGNIZE YOUR SERIOUSNESS TO PRACTICE,-----" HE SAID.--------------------------------- SUZUKI ASKED YVONNE ABOUT SILAS AND WAS PAINED TO HEAR THAT HE HAD------ ALREADY LEFT TO LEAD SESSHINS IN PORTLAND AND QUADRA ISLAND NEAR------ VANCOUVER. SILAS HAD COME TO SAY GOODBYE, BUT SUZUKI HAD BEEN SLEEPING. HE------ SAT NEXT TO HIM FOR A WHILE AND THEN LEFT. SILAS DID NOT SEE EYE TO EYE------ WITH RICHARD AND HAD ARGUED THAT THE MEMBERSHIP SHOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE------ TO APPROVE OF RICHARD AS THE NEW ABBOT. BUT MOST PEOPLE JUST WANTED TO DO------ WHAT SUZUKI WANTED. THE BOARD MEMBERS WERE ALL STUDENTS AND COULDN'T------ ACCEPT SILAS'S DEMOCRATIC AND LEGAL APPROACH. HE HADN'T SEEN MUCH OF------ SUZUKI SINCE RICHARD RETURNED. NOW SUZUKI WAS THINKING ABOUT SILAS.--------------------------------- WITHIN A WEEK OF THE CEREMONY, SUZUKI HAD ALMOST COMPLETELY STOPPED------ TALKING. THEN HE STOPPED EATING. HIS BODY WAS SOFT AND WEAK AND THIN, THE------ SIZE OF AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD CHILD. IT HAD ALWAYS HAD A CHILDLIKE QUALITY------, BUT WITH GREAT STRENGTH AND ENERGY, THE POWER TO MOVE LARGE STONES. NOW IT------ WAS A DARK, DYING CHILD'S BODY.---------------------------------------- OKUSAN------ TOLD RYUHO NOT TO BOTHER COMING ANYMORE.------- EITHER OKUSAN OR YVONNE------ STAYED CLOSE BY. THEY STILL MASSAGED HIM GENTLY, BUT TO YVONNE IT SEEMED------ THAT MAINLY THEY WERE JUST BREATHING TOGETHER. SHE FELT THERE WAS ALMOST------ NOTHING THEY NEEDED TO DO. JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE, BE WITH HIM, AND RESPOND------ TO HIS FEW REQUESTS. THEY WIPED HIS FACE. WHEN HE STOPPED DRINKING, THEY------ KEPT HIS LIPS AND MOUTH MOIST WITH A WASHCLOTH.--------------------------------- RICHARD CAME EVERY DAY. SOMETIMES HE WOULD TALK TO SUZUKI WITH OKUSAN'S------ HELP. SHE SAID HE COULD HARDLY HEAR NOW.----- "WHERE WILL I MEET------ YOU?-----" RICHARD ASKED, STANDING IN GASSHO AT THE FOOT OF THE BED.------ SUZUKI'S HANDS CAME OUT FROM UNDER THE COVERS IN GASSHO. THEN, WITH INDEX------ FINGER EXTENDED, HE DREW A CIRCLE IN THE AIR, BOWED INTO IT, AND RETURNED------ HIS HANDS UNDER THE COVERS. RICHARD BOWED IN RETURN.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- T-----------------------------------------------HAT WE ARE HERE MEANS------ WE WILL VANISH.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ON THE EVENING OF DECEMBER 3, SUZUKI WAS MOVED FROM THE HOSPITAL BED------ OVERLOOKING THE COURTYARD TO HIS OWN BED IN HIS APARTMENT.----------- "TOMORROW,-----" HE TOLD OKUSAN IN A HOARSE WHISPER,----- "I MUST------ TALK TO RICHARD ABOUT SILAS.------------------" OKUSAN WENT INTO THE TATAMI ROOM AND SPREAD OUT THE FUTON. FOR THE------ FIRST TIME SHE DIDN'T PUT ON HER PAJAMAS, BUT LEFT HER CLOTHES ON AND LAY------ DOWN EXHAUSTED TO SLEEP.------------- SUZUKI'S SON OTOHIRO HAD BEEN THERE FOR-A COUPLE OF DAYS AND-SAID HE------ WOULD STAY TILL THE END, WHICH HE KNEW WAS NEAR. HE SLEPT ON OKUSAN'S BED------, UP AGAINST HIS FATHER'S IN THE SMALL ROOM. AT ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING------ OTOHIRO SHOOK OKUSAN AWAKE.----- "MOTHER! MOTHER! FATHER WANTS A------ BATH.-----------------------" "NO NO NO.-----" SHE WENT IN AND TOLD HER HUSBAND TO GO BACK TO------ SLEEP. HE REPEATED THAT HE WANTED A BATH. THE THOUGHT OF IT MADE OKUSAN------ ANXIOUS. HE HADN'T BEEN IN A TUB FOR A LONG TIME.------------------ "IT'S OKAY,-----" HE SAID.------------- OTOHIRO WASN'T GOING TO ARGUE. HE KNEW THE OLD MAN WOULD BE STUBBORN TO------ THE END. OKUSAN WENT INTO THE BATHROOM AND STARTED TO FILL THE TUB.------ OTOHIRO CARRIED HIM INTO THE BATHROOM SLOWLY AND PLACED HIM IN THE TUB.------ SUZUKI STARTED GASPING FOR AIR, BREATHING FAST.----- "IT'S ALL OVER-----------," HE SAID BETWEEN SHORT BREATHS.------------------ "CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN,-----" OTOHIRO SPOKE SOOTHINGLY IN HIS EAR------ HOLDING HIM.----- "BREATHE SLOWLY, BREATHE SLOWLY.-----" OTOHIRO BREATHED------ LOUDLY AND SLOWLY, AND HIS FATHER'S BREATH SLOWED DOWN TILL THEY WERE BOTH------ BREATHING TOGETHER AT THE SAME SLOW RATE.------------- SUZUKI ASKED FOR THE BAR OF SCENTED SOAP THAT DELLA HAD GIVEN HIM. HE------ NEVER USED ANYTHING SCENTED, BUT HE TOOK IT AND SLOWLY MADE A GOOD LATHER------, AND THEY HELPED HIM TO CLEAN HIMSELF THOROUGHLY. THEN HE TOOK A LONG------, RELAXED BATH.------------- AFTERWARD SUZUKI LAY ON THE BED AND SIGHED. SLOWLY AND FAINTLY HE------ SPOKE.----- "AHHHH, WHAT A GOOD FEELING,-----" HE SAID, WITH A WISP OF------ PLEASURE ON HIS FACE.----- "DON'T WAKE ME IN THE MORNING.-----------------------" "MAYBE YOU'RE THIRSTY,-----" SAID OKUSAN.----- "WOULD YOU LIKE------ SOME ORANGE JUICE OR ICE CREAM?-----------------------" "ORANGE JUICE.-----" HE DRANK SOME ORANGE JUICE, CLOSED HIS EYES------, AND WENT TO SLEEP.------------- OKUSAN WENT BACK TO HER FUTON AND OTOHIRO LAY DOWN NEXT TO HIS FATHER------ IN THE BED. BEFORE LONG IT WAS FOUR AND HE HEARD THE WAKE-UP BELL-A------ HANDBELL RUN THROUGH THE HALLS TO GET PEOPLE UP FOR ZAZEN. IT WAS NOT JUST------ ANY DAY'S ZAZEN, BUT DECEMBER 4, THE FIRST DAY OF A FIVE-DAY SESSHIN THAT------ WOULD CULMINATE ON BUDDHA'S ENLIGHTENMENT DAY, THE EIGHTH OF DECEMBER.------ OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE PARTICIPATING. OTOHIRO COULD HEAR PEOPLE------ OPENING AND CLOSING DOORS CAREFULLY, RUNNING WATER IN THE BATHROOM ACROSS------ THE HALL. THEN CAME THE SHARP SOUND OF THE WOODEN HAN BEING HIT------, INDICATING THAT THE NEW ABBOT, ZENTATSU BAKER-ROSHI (AS SUZUKI SAID TO------ CALL HIM), WAS ON HIS WAY TO OFFER INCENSE AT VARIOUS ALTARS. THE LAST------ ALTAR WAS THE ONE IN THE ZENDO, WHERE HE WOULD OPEN THE SESSHIN AND BEGIN------ THE FIRST PERIOD OF ZAZEN.------------- THE SOUND OF A BELL COULD BE HEARD FAINTLY COMING FROM THE DISTANT------ ZENDO. OTOHIRO FELT HIS FATHER MOVE SLIGHTLY. SUZUKI'S HAND REACHED OVER------ AND CLUTCHED HIS ARM.------------------ "GET BAKER,-----" CAME A THIN WHISPER.------------- OTOHIRO JUMPED OUT OF BED AND RAN INTO THE TATAMI ROOM.----- "MOTHER------! SOMETHING'S HAPPENING WITH FATHER! HE SAID TO GET BAKER------------------!" WITHOUT A WORD OKUSAN LEAPT UP AND WENT QUICKLY DOWN TO THE ZENDO.------------- RICHARD HAD JUST SAT DOWN ON HIS CUSHION AND STRAIGHTENED HIS ROBES------ WHEN OKUSAN OPENED THE SIDE DOOR. LEW WAS SITTING IN THE SPACE NEAREST------ HER.----- "GET ZENTATSU-----!" SHE WHISPERED URGENTLY.------------- RICHARD TOOK LONG STRIDES TO THE ZENDO DOOR AND THEN DASHED UP THE------ STAIRWAY TO SUZUKI'S ROOM. OKUSAN AND OTOHIRO LEFT SUZUKI ALONE WITH------ RICHARD. HE WAS STILL CONSCIOUS, AND WITH THE LAST------------- STRENGTH OF HIS LIFE HE JUST BARELY REACHED HIS HAND-OUT TO HIS BELOVED------ DISCIPLE. HALF SITTING, HALF KNEELING BY THE BED, RICHARD HELD HIS HAND------ AND TOUCHED HIS FOREHEAD TO SUZUKI'S. THEY RESTED THAT WAY FOR A FEW------ MOMENTS, THEN RICHARD FELT THE-MAN MOST DEAR TO HIM-SLIP AWAY, LET GO OF------ HIS LIFE. SLOWLY, SHUNRYU SUZUKI-ROSHI FADED AWAY-SO GENTLY THAT RICHARD------ COULD NOT TELL WHEN HE DIED; HE JUST KNEW IT HAD HAPPENED.------------- RICHARD LET GO OF SUZUKI'S HAND. HE WAITED A MOMENT AND FELT FOR A------ PULSE. THEN HE WENT OUTSIDE TO OKUSAN AND OTOHIRO. RICHARD HAD HIS HAND ON------ HIS HEART. HE SPOKE IN JAPANESE, HIS VOICE CRACKING, AS HE TOLD THEM,----------- "SUZUKI-ROSHI'S LIFE HAS ENDED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
