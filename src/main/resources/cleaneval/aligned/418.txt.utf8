RECOUNT JUST BRIEFLY THAT I HAD A PHONE- CONVERSATION THIS MORNING WITH-ADMIRAL HANK GIFFEN, THE COMMANDER- OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BATTLE GROUP.- HE'S PREPARING-THAT AIRCRAFT- CARRIER AND HIS BATTLE GROUP TO TRANSIT THE SUEZ CANAL LATER ON TODAY.- THEY'RE EN ROUTE-TO THE PERSIAN GULF TO WORK FOR THE CINC CENTRAL- COMMAND.---------- ADMIRAL LYLE BIEN- AND HIS BATTLE GROUP ON THE NIMITZ IS- STEAMING ACROSS THE INDIAN OCEAN EN-ROUTE TO THE VICINITY OF TAIWAN-, WHERE THEY WILL JOIN ADMIRAL JIM ELLIS- AND THE INDEPENDENCE- BATTLE GROUP IN PROVIDING THAT TREMENDOUSLY CAPABLE PRESENCE TO- HOPEFULLY STABILIZE THAT AREA.----- WITH THAT, SIR, I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU AND- THE SUBCOMMITTEE-MEMBERS MAY HAVE.------------ WARNER:- ADMIRAL.---------- STEIDLE:- SIR.- GOOD MORNING, SIR.- I'M CRAIG STEIDLE.- I'M THE- PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE-JAST PROGRAM.----------- SIR, I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INVITATION TO BE HERE TO- DISCUSS THE JOINT ADVANCE STRIKE-TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM, A PROGRAM THAT- HAS JUST TRANSITIONED TO THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAM.- BECAUSE IT- HAS BEEN SO DYNAMIC, I HAVE A SHORT BRIEF STATEMENT.- I ALSO HAVE A- MORE DETAILED-LONGER VERSION I'LL SUBMIT, SIR.---------- WARNER:- WELL, ALL STATEMENTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY WILL BE ADMITTED- TO THE RECORD, AND YOU MAY-PROCEED WITH YOUR SHORT STATEMENT.------------ STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.- THANK YOU.---------- SIR, WE HAVE MATURED FROM THE JAST PROGRAM AND ARE NOW CONVERGING- ON AN AFFORDABLE-SOLUTION THAT MEETS REQUIREMENTS OF ALL THREE- SERVICES, PLUS OUR ALLIES -- THE NAVY, MARINE CORPS-AND THE AIR FORCE- AS WELL AS OUR ALLIES.- SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THE PROGRAM REMAINS- AFFORDABILITY- --REDUCING THE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, PRODUCTION COSTS-, COSTS OF OWNERSHIP OF JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER-FAMILY OF AIRPLANES.-------------- WE'VE FULLY MERGED THE ADVANCED RESEARCH AND PROJECT AGENCIES-, ASTOVL, ADVANCED SHORT-TAKE-OFF AND VERTICAL LANDING PROGRAM, INTO THE- JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAM.- AND ADDITIONALLY-THE UNITED KINGDOM- ROYAL NAVY HAS JOINED THE PROGRAM AS A COLLABORATIVE PARTNER.- THEY- ARE-COMMITTING $200 MILLION TO THE PROGRAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE- TERMS OF AN MOU THAT WE SIGNED-IN DECEMBER OF '--------------INTEREST HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HIGH IN OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES.- WE'VE PROVIDED SEVERAL DIFFERENT-BRIEFINGS, AND I EXPECT THE INTEREST- TO CONTINUE AT A HIGH LEVEL.---------- THE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON A NEW APPROACH FOR WEAPONS SYSTEMS- ACQUISITION.- WE APPLIED THE-RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PACKARD COMMISSION- AND OTHER EXPERTS IN ACQUISITION REFORM.- WE-CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT- THAT PROVIDES EARLY INTERACTION BETWEEN THE WARFIGHTERS AND THE- TECHNOLOGISTS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE COST AND PERFORMANCE TRADES- EARLY.- AND THAT'S BEEN A-SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE PROGRAM.-------------- WE'VE DONE THIS BY UTILIZING THE INTEGRATED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT- TEAM PROCESS.- INDUSTRY IS A-FULL PARTNER IN THIS PROCESS, AND THEY- WELCOME THIS TREMENDOUSLY.- THEY HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE-IN OUR- PROCESS AND OUR WAY OF DOING BUSINESS.------------ THE FIRST FORMAL PRODUCT THAT CAME OUT OF THIS INTEGRATED- INDUSTRY-WARFIGHTER TECHNOLOGISTS-GROUP AND TEAMING RELATIONSHIP WAS- OUR INITIAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT THAT WAS SIGNED BY ALL-THREE- SERVICES LAST AUGUST, AND WAS SUBMITTED, APPROVED AND ENDORSED BY THE- JROC IN AUGUST-OF LAST YEAR.------------ WE CONTINUE TO BE A ROLE MODEL FOR ACQUISITION REFORM AND- STREAMLINING A LOT OF INITIATIVES IN-COHERENCE WITH OUR INDUSTRIAL- PARTNER.- WE'RE JUST COMPLETING THE CONCEPT DEFINITION PHASE.-------------- WE'LL FINISH THAT PHASE THIS SUMMER, AND THEN MOVE ON INTO THE- CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT PHASE-WHERE WE WILL DOWNSIZE FROM THREE TEAMS THAT- WE HAVE TODAY TO TWO TEAMS.- EACH ONE OF THE-TEAMS WILL BUILD- DEMONSTRATORS DEMONSTRATING COMMONALITY, HOVERING TRANSITION, FLYING- QUALITIES, AS WELL AS CONTINUE WITH OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -TECHNOLOGY MATURATION-PROGRAMS.------------ STEIDLE:- EACH ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS WILL DEMONSTRATE TWO- AIRCRAFT, AND DEMONSTRATE THE-PARTICULAR ATTRIBUTES THAT I-JUST- MENTIONED.- IN CONCLUSION, SIR, WE STRONGLY...---------- WARNER:- LET'S JUST STOP A MINUTE.- THAT'S A TOTAL OF -- WHAT?- -- SIX AIRCRAFT?----------- STEIDLE:- NO, SIR.- THAT'LL BE TWO AIRCRAFT.- WE'LL DOWNSIZE TO- TWO CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT-TEAMS, AND EACH ONE OF THOSE TEAMS WILL FLY- TWO AIRPLANES EACH.---------- WARNER:- SO THAT'S FOUR?---------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.- FOUR AIRPLANES, YES, SIR.---------- SO, IN MY CONCLUDING REMARKS, SIR, THE SERVICES STAND EXTREMELY- COMMITTED TO THE PROGRAM AS-DOES OSD AND INDUSTRY.- AND I STAND BY TO- ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS, SIR.------------ WARNER:- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WILL ASK -- AND I WAS GOING TO- SEND THIS UP SO YOU COULD-READ IT IF YOU HAVEN'T.- I'M SURE YOU HAVE- READ THE NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE.---------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.- I HAVE.----------- WARNER:- AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU MOMENTARILY IF YOU WOULD SORT- OF GIVE US A SIDE BY-SIDE AS TO -- IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE VERY WELL- WRITTEN AND RESEARCHED.- BUT SINCE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT-PIECE ON THIS- ARTICLE -- AND I COMMEND THE PAPER AND-THE WRITER -- I WANT TO MAKE- SURE OUR RECORD-SHOWS ANY AREAS OF WHICH YOU AS THE MANAGER DISAGREE.-------------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.------------ WARNER:- SO YOU HAVE IT THERE.---------- STEIDLE:- NO, SIR.- I DON'T, BUT I DO-REMEMBER THE ARTICLE.-------------- WARNER:- WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO.- I'LL GET IT- REPRODUCED FOR YOU AND SENT RIGHT UP-THERE.---------- STEIDLE:- THANK YOU.---------- WARNER:- GENERAL.---------- MAGNUS:- MR. CHAIRMAN, SENATOR, GOOD MORNING.- I THANK YOU FOR- THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR-BEFORE YOU TO DISCUSS MARINE CORPS TACTICAL- AVIATION.---------- I ALSO HAVE, IN ADDITION TO THE FORMAL STATEMENT, I HAVE SOME- SHORT OPENING REMARKS WHICH I-WOULD PREFER TO SUBMIT FOR THE RECORD.- AND I-WOULD LIKE TO ALSO ADD THAT ON BEHALF OF THE STRONG-SUPPORT OF- THE CONGRESS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, THE MARINE CORPS HAS- ALWAYS BEEN-READY TO BE -- WHETHER IT'S FORWARD DEPLOYED OR ON BASES- IN THE UNITED STATES -- TO CONTINUE TO BE-AMERICA'S 911 FORCE.-------------- IN ADDITION TO THE FORWARD DEPLOYED FORCES THAT ADMIRAL MCGINN- HAS MENTIONED AND, OF-COURSE, MY AIR FORCE WINGMEN HAS AROUND THE- WORLD, TODAY YOU HAVE MARINES AND F-18DS AND-E-A6BS POISED IN AVIANO- TO SUPPORT AMERICAN AND ALLIED FORCES IN BOSNIA.- THERE ARE MARINE- FORCES FORWARD DEPLOYED IN OKINAWA AND ON THE MAIN ISLANDS OF JAPAN- READY TO SUPPORT-CONTINGENCIES THERE.- AND AS OUR COMMANDANT HAS- SAID...----------- WARNER: I VISITED THE MARINES IN AVIANO ON MY LAST TRIP THERE.-------------- MAGNUS:- YES, SIR.---------- AND THERE ARE MARINES EMBARKED ON AMPHIBIOUS SHIPS ACROSS THE- GLOBE SUPPORTING THE CARRIER-BATTLE FORCES WITH OUR VIETNAM-ERA- HELICOPTERS PREPARED TO DO THE NATION'S BIDDING.---------- ALL I CAN SAY TO ECHO OUR COMMANDANT IS READINESS IS OUR- BUSINESS.- AND WE STAND BY TO-ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.---------- WARNER:- ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.- WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO- START WITH YOU, GENERAL-EBERHART. AND I PRESUME YOU'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE REVIEWED TO SOME- EXTENT THE RECORD-OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE AS IT REVIEWED THE 22 PROGRAM- LAST YEAR.- AND OUR MAJOR CONCERN WITH THE-SUBJECT OF CONCURRENCY.- WOULD YOU START, SORT OF AS A THRESHOLD WHERE WE LEFT OFF LAST- YEAR, HOW-THE '96 PROGRAM HAS UNFOLDED TO DATE, AND WHAT YOU WOULD- HOPE TO DO ON CONCURRENCY ISSUE IN-THE '---------------EBERHART:- SIR, I HAVE REVIEWED THE CONCURRENCY ISSUE.- WITH YOUR- PERMISSION, I'D LIKE TO-GO BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THOUGH AND- TALK ABOUT -- WE WERE CONCERNED WITH CONCURRENCY-FROM THE VERY- BEGINNING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE GOING TO GET THIS CORRECT.- AS SUCH, WE LOOKED-AT WHAT THE PACKARD COMMISSION SAID ABOUT- CONCURRENCY.------------ EBERHART:- WE THINK THIS PROGRAM COMPLIES WITH THE, WHAT WAS- POINTED OUT IN THE PACKARD-COMMISSION.- RAND LOOKED AT THE CONCURRENCY- ISSUE.- THEY COMMENTED FAVORABLY IN TERMS OF-CONCURRENCY IN THE F-----AND JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD IT RIGHT, AS YOU KNOW, THE- DEFENSE-SCIENCE BOARD LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE AND SUBMITTED A REPORT IN- 1995, WHICH IN OUR VIEW SUPPORTS-THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT TOO- CONCURRENT. THERE IS SOME CONCURRENCY.- WE THINK THERE WILL BE-CONCURRENCY IN- MOST ALL PROGRAMS TODAY.- BUT WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT CONCURRENCY.- WE-THINK IT'S UNDER CONTROL.---------- WARNER:- WE ADDED TO BE 70-ODD AIRCRAFT IN OPERATIONAL STATUS- BEFORE THE LAST MILESTONE IS-COMPLETED UNDER -- IS IT THE T&E PROGRAM?-------------- EBERHART:- SIR, BEFORE WE GO TO FULL-RATE PRODUCTION, THERE'LL BE- 70-SOME-ODD AIRPLANES. AS-YOU KNOW, WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE ACQUISITION REFORM OF '-94, THEY RECOMMENDED APPROXIMATELY-10 PERCENT, WHICH, IF HAD WE STAYED- WITH THE ORIGINAL BUY OF ABOUT 700 AND SOME-ODD, 10 PERCENT-WOULD HAVE- BEEN 70-SOME-ODD.- BUT AS WE'VE DRAWN DOWN THE TOTAL BUY, AND ALSO- EXTENDED THE-PERIOD OF EMD, WE THINK THAT'S A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE THAT- WE WILL IN FACT HAVE MORE AIRPLANES AS-WE GO TO FULL-RATE PRODUCTION- THAN THIS 10 PERCENT GUIDELINE TALKS ABOUT.---------- BUT WE THINK THE IMPORTANT PARTS -- AND THEY HAVE BEEN, ONCE- AGAIN, AUTHENTICATED BY THE-REPORTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT -- IS FIRST- OF ALL, THE DT&E, WHICH WE THINK IS MOST IMPORTANT, WILL-BE FINISHED- ESSENTIALLY BY THE TIME WE HAVE FOUR AIRPLANES.---------- WARNER:- FOR THE RECORD, SPELL OUT, I KNOW WHAT DT&E...-------------- EBERHART:- DEVELOPMENT TEST AND EVALUATION.---------- WARNER:- RIGHT.---------- EBERHART:- AND THEN THE INITIAL OPERATIONS TEST AND EVALUATION-, THE RAND CORPORATION SAID-MOST PROBLEMS UNFOLD BETWEEN THE 10 AND- 20 PERCENT POINT IN IOT&E.- AND WE WILL IN FACT HAVE-27 PERCENT OF IOT&E.- FOR THESE REASONS, SIR, WE BELIEVE THAT CONCURRENCY IS JUST ABOUT- RIGHT IN-THIS PROGRAM.- WE'LL CONTINUE TO WATCH IT.- WE'RE CONCERNED- ABOUT IT JUST AS YOU ARE, BUT WE THINK-IT'S ON THE MARK.--------- WARNER:- NOW, EACH OF THE US HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS.- I THINK IT'S-, REALLY, ONE OF THE HIGHEST-RATES OF CONCURRENCY THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED. BUT THAT, IN YOUR-JUDGMENT -- AND GENERAL FOGELMAN-HAS TESTIFIED- THIS WEEK BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE -- THAT DEGREE OF CONCURRENCY IS- DRIVEN BY THE-THREAT ASSESSMENT THAT HAS BEEN MADE BY A VARIETY OF- SOURCES, BY TRADITIONAL-SOURCES, SUCH THAT TO-HAVE U.S. AIR DOMINANCE- IN THE THEATER, IN THE TIME FRAME WHEN THIS PLANE IS SCHEDULED TO COME- IN, IT SIMPLY HAS TO HAVE THAT NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT, AND THAT DESIGN OF- AIRCRAFT, TO MEET THAT THREAT.- IS THAT A FAIR SUMMARY?------------ EBERHART:- SIR, WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AIR DOMINANCE.- WE'RE- CONCERNED ABOUT INSURING-THAT WE HAVE AIR DOMINANCE AS QUICKLY AS- POSSIBLE.- AND IN OUR VIEW, THE F-22 DOES THAT FOR US.-BUT AGAIN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF AIRPLANES, THE 70-SOME-- ODD, BY THE TIME WE GO TO-FULL RATE, IF WE GO BACK TO SOME OF THE- OTHER FACTORS WE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF AN EXTENDED-EMD IN HAVING A- BI-PROFILE THAT MAKES SENSE.---------  WARNER:- WELL, BUT IT'S THE THREAT SCENARIO THAT'S DRIVING THAT- QUANTUM OF CONCURRENCY.- AND-THAT DEPENDS ON INDIVIDUALS TO HOW YOU- WANT TO QUANTIFY IT.- I MEAN, YOU VERY CAREFULLY HAVE-QUANTIFIED IT- FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE.----------- WARNER:- I JUST QUANTIFY IT BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE.- I MEAN- THIS COMMITTEE HAS GONE-THROUGH A NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS THAT- HAVE NOT MATERIALIZED AS ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED. LET'S-TALK ABOUT YOUR FLY-AWAY COSTS FOR----- CONSIDERING THE- CHANGES IN THE PROGRAM TO DATE -- AND-THERE HAS BEEN A REASSESSMENT OF- WEIGHT -- GENERAL FOGLEMAN WENT INTO THAT. DID YOU HAVE AN-OPPORTUNITY TO BE DEBRIEFED ON WHAT HE SAID ON- WEIGHT?---------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR, I DID.---------- WARNER:- TO CAPSULE THE WEIGHT ISSUE, AS I RECALL IT, WAS THAT HE- DECIDED HE COULD MAKE A-DEGRADATION IN THE ENVELOPE, AND THEREBY ALLOW- AN INCREASE IN THE WEIGHT.- AND THAT DEGRADATION-IN HIS PROFESSIONAL- JUDGEMENT WOULD NOT SUBSTANTIALLY IN ANY WAY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF- THIS-AIRCRAFT TO MEET THE THREATS. IS THAT CORRECT?---------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR.- THAT'S ESSENTIALLY CORRECT.- THERE'S A- LITTLE MORE TO IT, BUT THAT'S...------------ WARNER:- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU PUT THAT IN?------------ EBERHART:- YES, SIR.- I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WEIGHT OF- THE AIRPLANE, IT'S STILL-ABOUT 2,500 POUNDS BELOW WHAT WE THINK THE- MAX ALLOWABLE WEIGHT WOULD BE FOR THIS AIRPLANE.-WE DID LOOK AT -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW, AND YOU REFERENCED THE- TESTIMONY LAST YEAR -- THAT IN FACT-,AT THAT TIME, WE WERE CONCERNED- ABOUT THE WEIGHT GROWTH THAT WE HAD SEEN TO THAT TIME.- AND-WE'VE- TAKEN VERY AGGRESSIVE MEASURES TO BRING THIS UNDER CONTROL.- AND WE- THINK WE HAVE TODAY-TO INCLUDE WEIGHING, TO REVIEWING IT EVERY OTHER- WEEK, TO REPORTING IT TO THE PROGRAM MANAGER.----------- WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY NOW TO WEIGH SOME OF THE- PARTS.- IN FACT, WE'VE-WEIGHED ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE PARTS -- THE- ACTUAL PARTS THAT WE'VE CUT -- AND WE'RE PLUS- 30POUNDS OUT OF THIS- WHOLE 3,000 POUNDS THAT WE'VE WEIGHED. AND THEN WHEN WE'VE LOOK AT-AVIONICS, WE'VE WEIGHED HUNDREDS OF- PIECES AND WE'RE MINUS TEN POUNDS. SO WE THINK WE HAVE-GOOD UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR MODEL IS ON- TRACK.------------ THE SITUATION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WHERE WE LOOKED AT THE- WEIGHT THAT WE HAD AT THAT TIME-,AND WHAT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE IN- TERMS OF THRUST TO GET US THE G AVAILABLE AT 1.0 ON THE-PERFORMANCE- CURVE.---------- WE LOOKED AT WHAT THAT WOULD COST US IN TERMS OF DOLLARS TO- INSURE A VERY SMALL CHANGE IN G-AVAILABLE.- I'M TALKING .0 SOMETHING- IN TERMS OF GS.- VERY NEGLIGIBLE.- WE LOOKED AT WHAT THAT-MEANT IN- TERMS OF OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY.- AND WE BELIEVED THAT WAS NEGLIGIBLE- -- AND IT WASN'T-JUST THE AIR FORCE, SIR, WE VETTED THIS AND VETTED- THIS THROUGH THE JROC PROCESS WITH THE OTHER-VICE CHIEFS, THE VICE- CHAIRMAN AND THE CHAIRMAN AND THE CINCS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE- UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT -- NEGLIGIBLE IN TERMS OF OPERATIONAL- CAPABILITY. I GUESS THE BOTTOM-LINE IS WE LOOKED AT IT BASED ON WHAT IT WOULD- COST US TO KEEP THAT .0X AMOUNT OF GS AT THIS ONE-POINT ON THE- PERFORMANCE CURVE, AND WE DIDN'T THINK THE COST WAS WORTH IT.-------------- WARNER:- LET'S RETURN MOMENTARILY AND THEN I'LL YIELD TO MY- COLLEAGUE.- ABOUT THE FLY-AWAY-COST, WHAT DO YOU ESTIMATE THE FLY-AWAY- COST OF 22 IN THE FISCAL '96 DOLLARS?------------ EBERHART:- SIR, I'LL -- I GET THE FLY-AWAY COSTS CONFUSED A- LITTLE BIT HERE, SO LET ME MAKE-SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND IT.- I THINK- IT'S AROUND $70 MILLION, BUT LET ME CHECK THAT FOR YOU TO MAKE-SURE I- HAVE IT RIGHT.------------- IT'S $71.2, SIR.- FOR THE RECORD, $71.--------------WARNER:--- $71.------------EBERHART:- YES, SIR.---------- WARNER:- AND THAT'S PREDICATED ON 442 UNITS?------------ EBERHART:- YES, SIR.---------- WARNER:- SENATOR LEVIN.------------- LEVIN:- THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.------------ LEVIN:- ON THE F-22 CONCURRENCY ISSUE FIRST.- IS THERE MORE OR- LESS CONCURRENCY WITH THE-REDUCED BUY?----------- EBERHART:- SIR, IN TERMS OF THE REDUCED BUY, COUPLED WITH- STRETCHING OUT EMD, THERE IS-LESS CONCURRENCY.----------- LEVIN:- SO THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE BUYING A GREATER PERCENTAGE- -- PUT IT -- NO -- EVEN THOUGH-THE FULL RATE PRODUCTION OF THE F-22 IS- FOR A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL BUY, THE CONCURRENCY-HAS- ACTUALLY BEEN REDUCED.---------- EBERHART:- SIR, I BELIEVE THAT ONCE YOU STRETCH OUT EMD, AND YOU- HAVE LONGER TO WORK-THESE ISSUES AND THE IOC MOVES RIGHT -- THE- INITIAL OPERATION CAPABILITY -- AND YOU HAVE MORE-TIME TO WORK THIS- TEST AND EVALUATION PHASE, THAT THAT REDUCES THE CONCURRENCY.-------------- LEVIN:- NOW YOU, IN ANSWER TO THE CHAIRMAN'S QUESTION AS TO- WHETHER OR NOT THE SCHEDULE-FOR THE F-22 IS THREAT DRIVEN, ANSWERED-, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THAT IT IS IN FACT NOT BEING DRIVEN BY THE-THREAT.- BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO PUT THAT IN YOUR OWN WORDS.---------- ARE WE PRODUCING THIS BASED ON WHAT IS A PROPER, SAFE, RATE OF- DEVELOPMENT, OR ARE WE-PRODUCING THIS QUICKER THAN THAT IN ORDER TO- MEET SOME KIND OF A PRESUMED THREAT THAT WE'RE-GOING TO FACE IN THE- OUT YEARS?---------- EBERHART:- SIR, I THINK THAT IN EVERY CASE, THIS IS A BALANCE- BETWEEN THE THREAT THAT WE-ANTICIPATE AND WHAT WE THINK IS ACCEPTABLE- CONCURRENCY, AND ACCEPTABLE AND AFFORDABLE RATE OF-PRODUCTION. SO I THINK WE BALANCE THOSE TWO THINGS, AND THAT'S HOW WE DECIDE- WHAT THE IOC IS.---------- LEVIN:- HAS THE CONCURRENCY RATE CHANGED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS- FOR THE F-22?------------ EBERHART:- SIR, I HAVE NOT ADDRESSED A QUESTION SPECIFICALLY LIKE- THAT, AND I'M NOT AN-ACQUISITION EXPERT. I WILL PROVIDE FOR THE RECORD MY VIEW THAT WE HAVE STRETCHED OUT- EMD OVER-THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.- WE'VE MOVED THE IOC RIGHT.- SO TO- ME, AS AN OPERATOR, THAT MEANS THAT-THE CONCURRENCY -- IT'S NOT AS- CONCURRENT. NOW I'LL HAVE TO ASK THE ACQUISITION EXPERTS IF THEY-AGREE, IF- THEIR DEFINITION OF CONCURRENCY IS THE SAME AS MINE.------------ LEVIN:- OK.- SO THAT FROM YOUR OPERATOR'S PERSPECTIVE, THERE'S- LESS CONCURRENCY NOW IN THIS-PROGRAM THAN THERE WAS TWO YEARS AGO?-------------- EBERHART:- THAT WOULD BE MY VIEW AS AN OPERATOR.- YES, SIR.-------------- LEVIN:- I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO GIVE US THOSE CHARTS- SHOWING US THOSE TIMELINES-COMPARING FOR US THE MILESTONES THAT EXIST- NOW TO WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE TWO YEARS AGO.- I THINK IT-WOULD BE- HELPFUL...------------ EBERHART:- YES, SIR.----------- LEVIN:- ... TO DO THAT FOR THE RECORD. NOW THE SCIENCE BOARD FOUND THAT FOR THE F-22, THAT-ENGINE- DEVELOPMENT AND PASSIVE AVIONICS WERE THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS IN TERMS- OF CONCURRENCY.------------ EBERHART:- YES, SIR.----------- LEVIN:- COULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT?---------- EBELHART:- YES, SIR.- AND, IN FACT, I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF GOING- DOWN TO PRATT & WHITNEY AT-WEST PALM A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND LOOKING- AT THE ENGINE ON THE STAND AND RECEIVING EXTENSIVE-BRIEFINGS ON WHERE- THEY WERE A YEAR AGO -- AND WHERE THEY WERE TWO YEARS AGO AND WHERE- THEY-ARE.---------- IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE, THE STEPS THEY HAVE TAKEN TO MAKE SURE THAT- THIS AIRPLANE AND THE ENGINE-WILL BE READY FOR A FIRST FLIGHT IN MAY- OF '-----AND I'M CONVINCED IT WILL.- BUT THE TYPES OF-REDESIGN WE HAVE- DONE TO INCLUDE THE ADVANCES WITH THE HOWELL- BLADE, WE'RE- CONVINCED THAT-THAT WILL IN FACT WORK.- IT HAS TESTED SO WELL ON THE- TEST BAND, ON THE TEST STAND, AND IT'S A GO FOR-MAY OF '97 FOR THE- MAIDEN FLIGHT.------------ LEVIN:- THE SCIENCE BOARD REPORT INDICATED THAT ABOUT 20 PERCENT- OF THE AVIONICS TESTING WAS-GOING TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE LOT-- 2 CONTRACT AWARD.- AND AS I UNDERSTAND, LOT- 2 BEGINS AT-WHAT- PLANE?- GIVE ME THEIR...---------- EBERHART:- SIR, I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME.- WE'LL SEE IF- WE CAN GET IT BEHIND HERE, IF-NOT, WE WILL SUBMIT THAT FOR THE RECORD.-------------- LEVIN:- OK.- WELL, MY QUESTION DOESN'T DEPEND ON THE ANSWER TO- THAT.- SO WHATEVER THE-PLANE NUMBER IS WHERE LOT- 2 BEGINS, IT WAS- OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM THE SCIENCE BOARD REPORT THAT-THE AVIONICS- TESTING WOULD BE 20 PERCENT COMPLETED BEFORE THAT POINT.- OK?- NOW, IN- TERMS OF-THE ENGINE TESTING, WE DID NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER.- DO- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS? IN-OTHER WORDS, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE ENGINE TESTING WAS TO BE- COMPLETED PRIOR TO LOT- 2 PRODUCTION?------------ EBERHART:- I DO NOT KNOW, SIR.- I'LL HAVE TO SUBMIT THAT FOR THE- RECORD.------------ LEVIN:- OK.- THAT'LL BE FINE.- DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE- TESTING, THE ENGINE TESTING, IS-GOING TO BE ACTUAL TESTING AS COMPARED- TO MODELING AND SIMULATION?- IS THAT SOMETHING YOU-WOULD KNOW OFF-- HAND?---------- EBERHART:- NO, SIR.- I'M SORRY.- I'LL SUBMIT THAT FOR THE RECORD.-------------- LEVIN:- NO, THERE'S NO PROBLEM.- THAT'S FINE.- JUST SUBMIT THAT- FOR THE RECORD.------------ EBERHART:- YES, SIR.- AGAIN, AS AN OPERATOR -- GOING DOWN THERE-, VISITING AT PRATT- &WHITNEY, I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH WHAT I SAW.-------------- LEVIN:- THERE WAS A QUESTION, ADMIRAL MCGINN ON CONCURRENCY ON- THE F-18 E&F- AND EVEN-THOUGH IT IS A CONCURRENCY QUESTION SO LET- ME USE THIS MOMENT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT-AT YESTERDAY'S HEARING, SENATOR WARNER NOTED THAT- THERE WOULD 76 F-22S THAT WOULD BE AUTHORIZED-AND APPROPRIATED BY- CONGRESS WHEN THE OPERATIONAL TESTING ON THE F-22 IS COMPLETED.- BELIEVE-THAT WAS THE FIGURE THAT WAS USED.---------- NOW THE F-18 E&F- PROGRAM, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT CONGRESS WILL- HAVE AUTHORIZED AND-APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR 114 E&FS- BEFORE- OPERATIONAL TESTING IS COMPLETED.- NOW IS THAT NOT EVEN-A GREATER- CONCURRENCY ISSUE THEN ON THE E&FS- THAN IT WOULD BE ON THE F-22S- IF THOSE NUMBERS-ARE CORRECT OR APPROXIMATELY CORRECT?---------- MCGINN:- SENATOR LEVIN I'D LIKE TO TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE CRAIG- STEIDLE WHO WAS A FORMER-PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE F/A18-E/F AND I THINK HE- CAN GIVE YOU A MORE INFORMED ANSWER ON-THAT.----------- STEIDLE:- SIR, IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'LL ANSWER THAT.- WHEN WE PUT- THAT PROGRAM TOGETHER IT WAS-A NON-CONCURRENT PROGRAM WITH- DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE AT EVERY MILESTONE.- BEFORE WE HAD-APPROVAL- TO GO ON WITH THE FIRST LRIP- BUY, WE HAD FIRST FLIGHT.- BUT- BEFORE WE WERE ALLOWED TO-GO FOR THE SECOND ONE, WE HAD DEMONSTRATED- 250 GLIDES- AND FLYING OF ALL SEVEN TEST ARTICLES.- BEFORE WE WENT- ON FOR THE THIRD LRIP- WE HAD ANOTHER DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE.- SO IT WAS A-VERY NON-CONCURRENT PROGRAM WITH DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE.------------ THE OPERATIONAL TESTING OF THAT PARTICULAR AIRCRAFT STARTED VERY- EARLY IN THE SIMULATORS WITH-ENOUGH- ASSESSMENT, FIRST OF ALL, AND- THERE WAS A LONG STRING.- THE OPERATIONAL TESTING FINISHES-WHEN WE- HAVE A FULL SUITE- OF AIRCRAFT -- FULL SUITE- OF WEAPONS IN- THE INVENTORY, BUT THE AIRPLANE-IS FIELDED BEFORE THAT WITH A LIST OF- REQUIRED WEAPONS SUITES- THAT THE SERVICE HAS PROVIDED FOR US.- SO- -- I'M SORRY -- BUT IT IS DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE DOING MILESTONES- WHICH CONTINUES ON-THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.------------ LEVIN:- HAS THERE BEEN ANY CHANGE IN THOSE MILESTONES DURING THE- LEVEL OF CONCURRENCY ON E-AND FS?------------ STEIDLE:- NO, SIR.- THERE HASN'T.- WE'VE BEEN ON SCHEDULE, ON- PERFORMANCE ALL THE WAY-THROUGH.- IT'S WORKED WELL.------------- WARNER:- LET ME GO BACK ON THE 22 CONCURRENCY, YOU'RE REFERRING- TO THE SCIENCE BOARD-REPORT OF APRIL, 1995, PAGE----- DO YOU HAVE A- COPY OF THAT WITH YOU, GENERAL.------------ EBERHART:- I DO NOW, SIR.---------- WARNER:- JUST A ROUGH CALCULATION, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS ARE- GOING TO HAVE ABOUT A HALF-BILLION DOLLARS INVESTED IN AIRPLANES- FLYING DURING THIS CURRENT CYCLE.- THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.- I-OCCURS TO- ME THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SOME ASSURANCE FROM CONGRESS THAT IF YOU IN THE- COURSE OF THIS-PROGRAM DISCOVER, JERRY- OUR PROBLEMS.- AND THAT'S- GOING TO EXACERBATE THE CONCURRENCY PROBLEM.- WHAT PROCEDURES DO WE- HAVE IN PLACE FOR FIRST,-ADDRESSING THOSE PROBLEMS INTERNALLY AND- MAKING-SUCH ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAM THAT MAY BE REQUIRED?- AND- SECONDLY, INFORMING THE CONGRESS-PROMPTLY OF WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO?-------------- EBERHART:- SIR, IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC PROCEDURES IN PLACE, I DON'T- KNOW.- I'LL HAVE TO SUBMIT-THAT FOR THE RECORD.- I CAN TELL YOU WHEN- THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT REFERENCE-THAT POINT- ON THE PERFORMANCE CURB WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT-THAT WOULD COST- US TO STAY WITH-IT AND ALSO WHEN WE LOOKED AT A RANGE ISSUE, THAT IN- BOTH CASES, AS SOON AS THAT WAS FOUND OUT-,THAT CAME FORWARD TO AIR- FORCE LEADERSHIP, IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO THE JROC- PROCESS AND WE- WERE OVER TALKING TO MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMITTEE AND YOURSELF, SIR, TO- DISCUSS THOSE WITH YOU.----------- EBERHART:- I PLEDGE TO YOU THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM OTHER- PROGRAMS, OTHER ISSUES, THAT THIS-BAD NEWS DOESN'T GET BETTER WITH- AGE; THAT WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE.- AND-EVERYBODY- WHO HAS A STAKE IN THE ACTION NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND BE INVOLVED- IN THE-CORRECTIVE ACTION. IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC PROCESS OR PROCEDURES THAT ARE IN PLACE-, I'LL HAVE TO GO-CHECK WITH THE ACQUISITION COMMITTEE.- BUT WATCHING- THAT FIRST-HAND AT THAT TIME, I WAS THE J- ON-THE JOINT STAFF AND- I SAW THAT UNFOLD, WHICH REALLY-GAVE ME A GOOD FEELING ABOUT -- I- THINK IT'S-TIED TO THE NEW ACQUISITION REFORM PROCESS AND THOSE TYPES- OF THINGS.------------ WARNER:- JUST READING FROM PAGE 35, QUOTE, IF THERE ARE- SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE-ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THESE KEY EVENTS AND- THEY'RE DESCRIBED EARLIER, OR IF THE PERFORMANCE LEVELS-ACHIEVED ARE- UNACCEPTABLE, THE PROGRAM COULD BE ADJUSTED BY STAYING AT THE FOUR- AIRCRAFT PER YEAR-PRODUCTION RATE FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. AND YOU GIVING THE COMMITTEE THE ASSURANCE THAT THEY'RE IN-PLACE- BESIEGED US TO MAKE THAT PROMPT ADJUSTMENT.- IS THAT CORRECT?- AND YOU- WILL PROVIDE FOR-THE RECORD?------------ EBERHART:- SIR, I BELIEVE THEY'RE IN PLACE.- I WILL PROVIDE FOR- THE RECORD WHAT THEY ARE.- IF-THEY'RE NOT, I'LL PROVIDE FOR THE RECORD- THAT THEY'RE NOT IN PLACE AND THEN WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO-SATISFY THAT- REQUIREMENT.------------- WARNER:- AND I WOULD LIKE JUST A SENTENCE IN THE LETTER THAT THIS- MATTER HAS BEEN REVIEWED-BY THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE.- I JUST- THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT A MATTER OF THIS SERIOUSNESS-,THAT THE- SECRETARY GIVE YOU FULL SUPPORT WHICH YOU'RE ENTITLED TO MAKE THAT- TOUGH DECISION FOR THE-DEPARTMENT.---------- EBERHART:- SIR, I AGREE, AND I'M SURE SHE WILL.---------- WARNER:- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT REPRESENTATION TO THE COMMITTEE.- LET'S PROCEED ON TO ANOTHER-ISSUE.----------- LEVIN:- THERE'S ONE...----------- WARNER:- YES, SURE.----------- LEVIN:- ON THAT ONE QUESTION -- JUST ON THIS ISSUE, IT'S A- -- WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE SATISFIED-ON THIS CONCURRENCY ISSUE.- I FOR- -- IS NOT PARTICULARLY SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER THAT YOU GAVE TO-THE- CHAIRMAN ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS NOT THREAT-DRIVEN OR NOT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE-RISKS, I HOPE, TO IN THIS PROGRAM. THAT- ARE GOING TO BE DRIVEN BY A THREAT WHEN IT SEEMS TO ME WE-SHOULD MAKE- SURE THAT WE DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES IN THE BUILDING OF THIS PLANE AND I-, FOR ONE-,WOULD RATHER IT BE DONE RIGHT IN A YEAR OR TWO LATER THAN TO- FIND THAT WE'VE-GOT TO DO A BUNCH OF-FIXES ON THIS PLANE.- SO WHEN YOU WERE ASKED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS THREAT-DRIVEN AND- THEN WHEN-YOU TOLD ME AND YOUR ANSWER TO THAT WAS NON-COMMITTAL WHEN- THE CHAIRMAN ASKED YOU, AND THEN-WHEN I ASKED YOU THE QUESTION ABOUT- THE LEVEL OF RISK AND THE CONCURRENCY AND THE SAME ISSUE-THAT THE- CHAIRMAN RAISED, YOU TALKED ABOUT A DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN GETTING- THERE AS SOON AS-POSSIBLE WHICH WAS YOUR WORDS.---------- LEVIN:- I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED WHEN YOU SAY AS SOON AS- POSSIBLE.- I THINK I WOULD HAVE SAID-IT, I WOULD HAVE PUT A QUALIFIER- BEFORE POSSIBLE, LIKE AS SOON AS REASONABLY POSSIBLE OR WITH- REASONABLE DEGREE OF CERTAINTY, OR SOMETHING IN THERE TO GIVE US SOME- ASSURANCE ON THE-CONCURRENCY ISSUE. BUT LET ME PHRASE THE QUESTION THIS WAY, AND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE- TO ANSWER-THIS, GENERAL.- AND IF SO, THAT'S FINE.- YOU CAN DO IT FOR- THE RECORD -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY-ABOUT THAT. BUT THE SCIENCE BOARD'S FINDINGS ABOUT THE ACCEPTABLE OVERLAP IN- THE F-22 PROGRAM-BETWEEN TESTING AND PRODUCTION DEPENDS UPON REQUIRING- THAT THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE TESTING- --EXCUSE ME -- MUST PASS CERTAIN- KEY EVENTS WHICH ARE IDENTIFIED.- AND THIS WAS WHAT THE-CHAIRMAN WAS- REFERRING TO.---------- IN THE C-17 PROGRAM, WHICH WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO BE OPERATING ON- AN EVENT-BASED SCHEDULE-,THE PRODUCTION IMPERATIVE KEPT US SIGNING- CONTRACTS EVEN THOUGH THE EVENTS WERE SLIPPING.- NOW-ADMIRAL STEIDLE-, ON THE F-18 DESCRIPTION, SAID THAT WE MUST MEET KEY EVENTS BEFORE- RELEASING-PROCUREMENT FUNDS.- IT WAS A VERY CLEAR ANSWER ON THAT- QUESTION. AND I THINK THE CHAIRMAN'S-QUESTION MAY HAVE BEEN -- I MAY BE- DUPLICATING THE CHAIRMAN'S QUESTION, BUT IF I AM LET ME PUT-THIS IN MY- OWN WORDS.- IS THE AIR FORCE COMMITTED TO STICKING TO ACHIEVING- TESTING EVENTS AS A-NECESSARY PREREQUISITE TO SIGNING THE F--22 CONTRACT?------------ EBERHART:- SIR, WE CERTAINLY ARE.------------ LEVIN:- PARDON?----------- EBERHART:- WE CERTAINLY ARE, YES.- WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THOSE- WICKETS, WE HAVE TO-ESTABLISH THOSE GOALS BEFORE DABS AND PRE-DAB AND- DRB DECISIONS.- SO WE WILL HAVE THOSE-MILESTONES BEFORE WE CAN MOVE- FROM ONE PORTION OF THE PROGRAM TO ANOTHER.- AND WE'RE-COMMITTED TO- THAT.- I THINK...----------- LEVIN:- AND OUR CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR THAT?- OUR EXISTING- CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR THAT?---------- EBERHART:- SIR, I ASSUME...---------- LEVIN:- LET US KNOW, LET US KNOW THAT FOR THE RECORD.------------ EBERHART:- AGAIN, I'LL HAVE TO PROVIDE THAT FOR THE RECORD.------------- LEVIN:- WE JUST DON'T -- WE WANT TO BE MOVING HERE ACCORDING TO- TESTING EVENTS HAVING BEEN-MET, NOT ACCORDING TO A SCHEDULE WHICH IS- SET FORTH IN A CONTRACT WITH A CONTRACTOR.- THAT'S THE-POINT HERE, AND- IF YOU CAN GIVE US THAT ASSURANCE FOR THE RECORD I THINK THAT AT LEAST- HELPS ME OUT-SOME.- THANK YOU.---------- EBERHART:- AND BACK TO YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION.- I THINK YOUR- CHOICE OF WORDS IS PROBABLY-MUCH BETTER THAN MINE, BUT I THINK THE- BOTTOM LINE-IS THAT WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE-CONCURRENCY.- WE THINK- THAT THE RISK IS ACCEPTABLE, THAT WE'RE NOT LETTING THE THREAT DRIVE- US TO DO-SOMETHING STUPID, SOMETHING DUMB.- WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH- THAT BALANCE.- AND WE'RE NOT -- AS-YOU SAID, AS SOON AS REASONABLY- POSSIBLE IS PROBABLY A BETTER CHOICE OF WORDS.---------- LEVIN:- MY MEMORY GOES BACK HERE NOT JUST TO THE C-17 BUT TO THE- B-1 AND B-2... YEAH-,WHERE WE- -- YOU KNOW, WE HAD -- SOMEHOW OR OTHER- THERE WAS A WINDOW OF VULNERABILITY, AND-WE HAD TO RUSH THE B-----AND- WE MADE A MISTAKE, MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES.- AS A RESULT, IT DIDN'T- HAVE THE CAPABILITIES THAT WE WANTED IT TO HAVE. INSTEAD OF SAYING, LOOK, LET'S BUILD THE B-2 AND DO-IT RIGHT AND- TAKE, IF WE HAVE, QUOTE, A LITTLE MORE VULNERABILITY FOR A FEW MORE- YEARS, MY GOD-,WE'VE GOT ENOUGH CAPABILITY IN THAT AREA ANYWAY, LET'S- DO IT RIGHT.---------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR.------------ LEVIN:- INSTEAD WE, I THINK -- AND I DON'T WANT TO REHASH THE- WHOLE B-1 BATTLE -- BUT I THINK-THE CHAIRMAN'S POINT IS, AND I WOULD- AGREE, IS THAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO THE F-22 RIGHT, AND WE DO-NOT WANT- A HIGH-LEVEL OF CONCURRENCY. AND IF THAT MEANS WE GET IT DONE A YEAR OR TWO YEARS LATER-,SO BE- IT.----------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR.- SIR, THOSE LESSONS THAT YOU REFERENCED ARE- NOT LOST ON THE AIR FORCE-EITHER, AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE- AS WE MOVE FORWARD.---------- EBERHART:- AND WE'RE -- BOTTOM LINE IS WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE- CONCURRENCY WE SEE IN-THIS PROGRAM.---------- LEVIN:- WELL, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY HAS HIS OWN VIEW.- IN MY VIEW-, IT'S A VERY HIGH DEGREE-OF CONCURRENCY ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGH DEGREE- OF RISK AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION-THAT THE THREAT THAT- WAS DRIVING THIS NOT IN A STUPID AREA, BUT JUST WE WERE AT THE OUTER- EDGE OF THE-ENVELOPE, AS YOU SAY, YOU FLY ON THE AREA OF RISK AND- CONCURRENCY. AND THAT WAS DRIVEN BY THE-SURFACE-TO-AIR THREAT.- AND I SEEM TO- HAVE GAINED THAT FROM GENERAL FOGLEMAN'S TESTIMONY-BECAUSE IT'S- -- THIS PROGRAM IS VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE.- IT'S CONSUMING EVER LARGER- AMOUNT OF THE-OVERALL BUDGET -- NOT ONLY DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE-, OF THE ACROSS-THE-BOARD TAC AIR PROGRAM-,AND THAT LIKEWISE CONCERNS- ME.---------- WARNER:- LET'S GO TO ADMIRAL AND THE JAST -- HAVE YOU HAD A- CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE TIME'S-ARTICLE?---------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.----------- WARNER:- AND ARE THERE AREAS IN WHICH YOU FEEL THAT YOU WOULD- LIKE TO PUT INFORMATION-,COMMENTS...---------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR, I WOULD.----------- WARNER:- ...OTHERWISE IN THE RECORD?- FINE.---------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR, I WOULD.---------- WARNER:- BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE, AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE- THAT OUR RECORD REFLECTS-ANY THOUGHTS YOU HAVE.------------ STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.- I THINK MR. SHANNON- DID AN OUTSTANDING- JOB ON THE ARTICLE IN TOTAL, SIR.---------- WARNER:- DID HE INTERVIEW YOU, BY ANY CHANCE?---------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR, HE DID.---------- WARNER:- WELL, THAT'S WHY IT'S OUTSTANDING THEN.------------ STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.- THERE WAS ONE AREA THAT HE LINKED...-------------- WARNER:- WHY DON'T YOU TEACH US POLITICIANS HOW YOU...-------------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.- HE HAD LINKED ME TO THE $750 BILLION- ESTIMATE THAT HE HAD, AND I, IN FACT-,WENT BACK TO HIM AFTER THE- SESSION THAT WE HAD AND SAID, I CANNOT ADD MY NUMBERS UP TO GET TO- THAT PARTICULAR FIGURE. MR. BLACKWELL- FROM LOCKHEED MENTIONED A TRILLION DOLLAR- PROGRAM AND A-WALL STREET ANALYST RECOMMENDED A $750 BILLION.- THEY- ARE PROBABLY -- THEY HAVE MORE-EXPERIENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR FIELD- THAN I HAVE, BUT 3,000 AIRPLANES AT $30 MILLION A COPY COMES-OUT TO- $90 BILLION, AND THIS IS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ABOVE THAT.- SO I TOLD- HIM I HAD DIFFICULTY-WITH THAT PARTICULAR FIGURE. ANOTHER AREA WAS -- IN THE ARTICLE HERE, I JUST NOTICED AND I'M- SORRY I-DIDN'T THE FIRST TIME I READ THIS -- AIRPLANES WILL ROLL OUT- IN------- THAT'S TRUE OF THE TEST ARTICLES.- THE FIRST OPERATIONAL- AIRPLANE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN------ AND THE THIRD PIECE THAT HE BRINGS IN IS-THE FACT THAT- -- ALLUDING TO THE FACT THAT PERHAPS THE NAVY WOULD POSSIBLY IN THE- FUTURE NOT-SUPPORT THE PROGRAM AS STRONGLY AS THE OTHER SERVICES.- I- THINK -- I DISAGREE WITH THAT. ADMIRAL-BOORDA HAS TOLD ME SEVERAL TIMES THAT HE FULLY SUPPORTS- THIS AND NEEDS THE AIRCRAFT, AND THE NAVY-IS FULLY BEHIND IT.- OTHER THAN THAT, SIR, I THINK IT'S ON TARGET.----------- WARNER:- ALL RIGHT.- LET'S ADDRESS THEN THE FUNDING PROFILE- -- $131 MILLION IN FISCAL '-----THAT WAS -- EXCUSE ME -- THAT WAS A CUT- OF $131 MILLION OFF A BASELINE OF WHAT FIGURE?----------- STEIDLE:- APPROXIMATELY $331, SIR.- IT-BROUGHT US DOWN TO ABOUT- $200 MILLION IN '----------------WARNER:- THOSE FIGURES -- YOU'RE GOING TO STICK WITH THEM?---------- STEIDLE:- I'M GOING TO REFINE THEM IN JUST A SECOND, SIR.-------------- WARNER:- ALL RIGHT.---------- STEIDLE:- I'LL GIVE YOU THE EXACT FIGURES THERE WITHIN PLUS OR- MINUS TWO OR THREE MILLION, SIR.---------- WARNER:- YOU KNOW, WHILE HE'S GETTING TO THE FIGURES, I HAVE TO- RECOUNT WHEN I USED TO-TESTIFY AS SECRETARY OF THE NAVY, WE WOULD- LITERALLY HAVE TWO DOLLY CARTS FULL OF RECORDS BEHIND-US.- AND NOW I- GUESS WITH THE MODERN COMPUTER AND BRIGHTER OFFICERS, WE'RE ABLE TO TO- IT WITH A-HANDFUL OF PAPERS.------------- STEIDLE:- OR SUBMIT A LOT FOR THE RECORD. SIR, THE EXACT FIGURES...----------- WARNER:- ALL RIGHT.---------- STEIDLE:- I'M SORRY, WE STARTED OUT WITH $345 MILLION AND WENT TO- $206 MILLION.----------- WARNER:- BEFORE -- OK, TELL US WHAT WAS THE IMPACT OF THAT CUT-, THEN.- THOSE ARE SOME-FAIRLY HEFTY BUCKS.----------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.- IF I COULD JUST STEP BACK FOR JUST A SECOND- FROM WHERE THE PROGRAM-STARTED.- IT STARTED IN THE BOTTOMS-UP REVIEW- IN '-----AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME, THE AFX PROGRAM-AND THE MULTI-ROLLER- FIGHTER AIRPLANE WERE CANCELLED, WERE ROLLED INTO ONE IN THIS- PARTICULAR-PROGRAM.---------- MR. DEUTCH IN AUGUST OF THAT YEAR ESTABLISHED A PROGRAM WITH A- MEMORANDUM AND LAID IN A-WEDGE AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME IN '93 FOR THE- PROGRAM.- SINCE THAT PARTICULAR TIME, WE'VE MERGED THE-A-STOVL- PROGRAM INTO IT.- WE'VE GONE FROM A TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION TO AN- ACTUAL STRIKE-FIGHTER PROGRAM AND THE WEDGE STAYED IN THE SAME SHAPE.- AND THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A-DEM-VAL OR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.- YOU- NEED UP FRONT FUNDS AND THE SHAPE OF THE CURVE-SHOULD BE A BELL-CURVE- SKEWED TO THE LEFT.----------- I WENT FORWARD IN AUGUST AND JULY OF LAST YEAR WITH REDEFINING- THE PROGRAM AS WE PUT SOME-MORE SUBSTANCE ON IT.- WENT FORWARD AND- THEN CAME ON OVER HERE TO SEVERAL OF THE STAFFS IN LATE-AUGUST OR- SEPTEMBER TIME FRAME, AFTER IT HAD GONE PAST YOUR PARTICULAR COMMITTEE- WITH THIS NEW-FUNDING PROFILE.- I PRESENTED A PROFILE THAT WAS GOING- TO USE '96 FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO DO WORK IN-'-----THAT FUNDING WAS- QUICKLY REMOVED AND THE STATEMENT WAS PUT IN THAT THAT FUNDING SHOULD- BE-APPLIED IN '-----THAT WAS TWO YEAR MONEY.- WE COULD DO THAT.------------- THE SERVICES CAME FORWARD WITH A-PROGRAM DECISION MEMORANDUM IN- SEPTEMBER FULLY FUNDING-THE PROGRAM TO THE NEW DEM-VAL PROFILE THAT- WE'RE EXECUTING TODAY. SO, IN ANSWER TO YOUR-QUESTION, SIR, THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE- RESHAPED THE PROGRAM AND WE HAVE THE MONEY IN THE RIGHT-YEAR AND THE- FUNDING PROFILE WAS CORRECT TO EXECUTE.-------------WARNER:- WHAT TIME SEQUENCE WAS IT ADJUSTED?----------- STEIDLE:- WE MOVED THE PROGRAM FOUR MONTHS TO THE RIGHT.- I- LOOKED AT SOME TECH-MATURATION PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE DOING.- WE MOVED- THOSE IN THE OUT YEARS. -WE LOOKED FOR-REDUNDANCIES AND SHELVED A FEW- OF THOSE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS.- MOVED THE END POINT OUT FOUR-MONTHS.- AND THE TOTAL PROGRAM WAS THEN RESHAPED AND MOVED TO THE RIGHT- SLIGHTLY.------------ WARNER:- I MAY RETURN TO THAT PROGRAM, BUT I'LL HAVE A QUESTION- FOR ADMIRAL MCGINN AND-THEN REFER TO MY COLLEAGUE.- THE OLD EA-6B- -- WHAT A WORKHORSE.---------- MCGINN:- YES, SIR.---------- WARNER:- I THINK THE TAXPAYERS GOT THEIR MONEY'S WORTH OUT OF- THAT PLANE, WOULDN'T YOU-SAY?---------- MCGINN:- THEY CONTINUE TO GET IT SENATOR.---------- WARNER:- NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.- THE COMMITTEE HAS WAITED FOR SOME- TIME FOR THE-COMPLETED STUDIES OF AIRBORNE ELECTRONIC WARFARE- REQUIREMENTS.- DESPITE DOD'S-UNRESPONSIVENESS, LAST YEAR'S DEFENSE- AUTHORIZATION BILL INCLUDED GENEROUS FUNDING FOR THE-ELECTRONIC- WARFARE UPGRADES AND MODIFICATIONS.- THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNED THAT- DELAYS IN-MAKING SUBSTANTIAL UPGRADES EA-6B WILL PREVENT THE NAVY FROM- CAPITALIZING ON PRIOR INVESTING-IN THE ADVANCE CAPABILITY, THAT'S THE- ADV CAP.- IS THE NAVY NOW READY TO MOVE OUT ON THIS-PROGRAM AND MAKE- IT A SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT TO NEAR TERM EW CAPABILITY?---------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR, WE ARE.- WE CONTINUED TO WISELY USE THE FUNDS- THAT CONGRESS PROVIDED-LAST YEAR, THE $165 MILLION.- WE SPENT- 100 MILLION OF THAT DOLLARS -- OR WE ARE SPENDING- 100MILLION OF THAT- DOLLARS IN UPGRADING 20 AIRCRAFT TO THE BLOCK 89, THE MORE MODERN- BLOCK- 89CONFIGURATION.- WE SPENT AN ADDITIONAL $40 MILLION TO GET- WHAT WE CALL BAND NINE AND TEN-ELECTRONIC WARFARE TRANSMITTER PODS.- AND THE FINAL $25 MILLION IS GOING FOR 30 PODS FOR-COMMUNICATIONS- JAMMING.---------- IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE HAVE R&D PROGRAMS THAT ARE ONGOING TO- ADDRESS THE IDEA OF A REACTIVE-JAMMING CAPABILITY, SOMETHING THAT YOU- CAN USE AGAINST A VARIETY OF THREATS.- WITH THE-PROLIFERATION OF FIRST- WORLD WEAPONS SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT MANY, MANY DIFFERENT AREAS OF- INTEREST-TO THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T GET SO- STABILIZED AND SOLIDIFIED IN A-PARTICULAR THREAT SYSTEM THAT WE CAN'T- REACT AGILELY THROUGH ADDITIONAL THREAT SYSTEMS THAT COULD BE-PUT- TOGETHER WITH MONEY BY A NATION WITH INTERESTS COUNTER TO OURS.- SO- THE REACTIVE JAMMING IS-ONE ANSWER TO HELP US TO BE ABLE TO FLY WITH- CONFIDENCE INTO AN ENEMY AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN ANY-UNCERTAIN FUTURE.-------------- WARNER:- I'M GOING TO ASK GENERAL MAGNUS A QUESTION ON JAST.- AND- MISTER RECORDER, CAN-YOU PUT THE GENERAL'S RESPONSE FOLLOWING REAR- ADMIRAL STEIDLE'S JAST COMMENTS SO WE'VE GOT-THAT ONE PLACED IN THE- RECORD.---------- GENERAL, IS YOUR INVITATION LETTER -- THAT IS IN OUR INVITATION- -- WE ASKED YOU ABOUT THE MARINE-CORPS VIEW OF JAST PROGRAM.- HOW- WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE RELEVANCE OF THAT PROGRAM TO THE-FUTURE OF THE- MARINE CORPS AVIATION?---------- MAGNUS:- MR. CHAIRMAN, I'M GLAD THAT YOU ASKED ME THAT QUESTION- BECAUSE I HAD THE-OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDANT-, GENERAL KRULAK, EXACTLY ON THAT TOPIC.---------- WARNER:- THIS MORNING?---------- MAGNUS:- THIS MORNING, SIR.---------- WARNER:- YOU GUYS GOT OFF TO A GOOD, EARLY START OVER THERE-, DIDN'T YOU?---------- MAGNUS:- YES, SIR.- AS I'VE SAID, SIR, READINESS IS YOUR CORPS.--- THE MARINE CORPS HAS MADE-THE COMMITMENT IN A REAL SENSE...-------------- WARNER:- YOU GOT A LITTLE SLEEP ALONG THE WAY, THOUGH, I SERVED- IN THE MARINES FOR MANY-YEARS WITHOUT ANY SLEEP, AND I ASSURE YOU THAT IT HELPS.---------- MAGNUS:- THE MARINE CORPS HAS MADE THE COMMITMENT IN A VERY REAL- WAY TO ACCEPT-NEAR-TERM RISK IN OUR STRIKE FIRE COMMUNITY, OUR AV-8B- HARRIERS AND OUR F/A-18S.- WE'RE PUTTING-OUR, LITERALLY OUR- INVESTMENT, OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS, AND THE TECHNOLOGY LEAP THAT- WE-SEE IS IN THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAM.---------- WE BELIEVE THAT WE AND THE NATION, OUR WINGMEN IN THE AIR FORCE- AS WELL AS OUR SHIPMATES IN-THE NAVY, URGENTLY NEED THE JOINT STRIKE- FIGHTER, AND WE BELIEVE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IN THE CORPS-THAT NOW IS- THE TIME TO TAKE THE INCREMENTAL DEGREE OF RISK, WE THINK, WITH THE- FORCES THAT WE-HAVE, LOOKING AT THE THREATS THAT ARE IN THE NEXT- DECADE, TO TAKE THAT LEAP TO 2008 TO THE JOINT STRIKE-FIGHTER.----------- WARNER:- OK, SO YOU'RE STILL ON BOARD.---------- MAGNUS:- YES, SIR.- WE'RE IN THE LEAD AS FAR AS OUR IOC- REQUIREMENTS, AND WE JOINED-,WELDED AT THE HIP WITH THE AIR FORCE AND- THE NAVY IN THE URGENT NEED FOR THIS AFFORDABLE-,SURVIVABLE FAMILY OF- OVER 2800 JOINT AIRCRAFT.---------- WARNER:- THANK YOU.- SENATOR LEVIN.---------- LEVIN:- JUST ONE QUESTION ON THE JAST PROGRAM.- ADMIRAL STEIDLE-, THE PRESS HAS REPORTED-RECENTLY THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE RELEASE- OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION TO COMPETING-CONTRACTORS BY THE JAST- OFFICE.- CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHETHER THIS IS A- SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM?---------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.- WELL, THERE WAS, INDEED, PROPRIETARY- INFORMATION.- THERE WAS AN-INADVERTENT DISCLOSURE, UNFORTUNATELY, AT- THE FAX MACHINE.- AN ENCLOSURE TO ONE PARTICULAR LETTER-WAS PUT INTO- TWO OTHER LETTERS THAT WENT OUT TO THE COMPETING CONTRACTORS.-------------- SO THEREFORE CERTAIN PRICING AND COSTING INFORMATION FROM ONE- CONTRACTOR WENT TO THE OTHER-TWO.- THE TWO PARTICULAR CONTRACTORS SAW- THAT IMMEDIATELY, WRAPPED IT UP.- I SENT MY SECURITY-OFFICER OUT THERE- AFTER IT.- WE HAVE STATEMENTS TO THAT EFFECT, AND WE ARE PROVIDING- INFORMATION TO-THE CONTRACTOR WHOSE INFORMATION WAS SENT. I HOPE TO HAVE IT COMPLETELY RESOLVED BY WEDNESDAY-AND THE- RELEASE OF OUR RFP ON THURSDAY OF NEXT WEEK.---------- WARNER:- WOULD YOU YIELD TO ME?----------- LEVIN:- SURE.---------- WARNER:- I -- AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME, IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE- WITH JAST.---------- LEVIN:- NO, I'M DONE WITH JAST.---------- WARNER:- I THINK, ADMIRAL STEIDLE, YOU SHOULD -- EVEN THOSE THIS- IS A PURPLE PROGRAM THAT-YOU'RE OPERATING -- WHAT'S THE NAVY'S- PERSPECTIVE ON JAST MEETING ITS REQUIREMENTS IN THE OUT-YEAR- -- OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS?---------- STEIDLE:--SIR, COULD I HAVE ADMIRAL MCGINN THAT, SIR?-------------- MCGINN:- JUST AS GENERAL MAGNUS STATED, WE ARE FIRMLY ONBOARD- WITH THE JAST PROGRAM-,SENATOR.- OUR NEED IN TERMS OF TIMING ISN'T AS- URGENT AS THE MARINE CORPS IN THE- 2007, 2008TIMEFRAME. BUT WE HAVE A ROAD MAP TO THE FUTURE THAT INVOLVES GOING FROM- WHERE WE ARE TODAY-WITH THE TYPES OF AIRCRAFT AND OUR AIR WINGS, USING- THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CAPABILITY OF THE-F-18EF AND THEN BLENDING- THAT IN A COMPLEMENTARY WAY WITH JAST WHEN IT COMES ONBOARD-NAVY- AIRCRAFT CARRIERS IN ABOUT THE 2010 TO 2012 TIMEFRAME -- ABOUT THREE- TO FOUR YEARS AFTER THE-MARINE CORPS.---------- WARNER:- GENERAL EBERHART, FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE...------------ EBERHART:- YES, SIR.---------- WARNER:- IS IT LIKEWISE YOUR...---------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR.- IT WOULD SOUND LIKE A RECORDING.- WE'RE- COMPLETELY BEHIND IT, AND WE-ARE.- IT'S KEY TO THE AIR FORCE OF THE- FUTURE.---------- WARNER:- AND IN ALL, THEN, THIS JOINT PROGRAM IS WORKING OUT- WELL?- AS A MATTER OF FACT, I-THINK YOUR DEPUTY, ADMIRAL STEIDLE, IS A- BG SELECTEE?---------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR, HE IS.- YES, SIR, THE AIR FORCE'S NEWEST- GENERAL, SIR.---------- WARNER:- GOOD.- THAT'S FINE.----------- STEIDLE:- IF HE DOESN'T MESS UP JAST.----------- WARNER:- SO WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE REALLY A GENERAL FOR- ABOUT 10, 15 MORE YEARS-THEN? ONLY THING I CAN TELL YOU, COLONEL, GENERAL OR WHATEVER THE CASE- MAY BE -- I KNEW GENERAL-EBERHART WHEN HE WAS A MAJOR.- SO SOMEHOW- HE'S MADE IT, DESPITE HIS ASSOCIATION WITH MEMBERS-OF CONGRESS.- ALL RIGHT.- EXCUSE ME, THANK YOU.- COLLEAGUE, I'D LIKE TO GET- THAT ONE JAST THING IN-THE RECORD ALTOGETHER.---------- LEVIN:- WELL, THE FOLLOW-UP ON THAT JAST QUESTION WOULD BE YOU- SAY THAT THE COMPETITOR-WHOSE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION WAS- INADVERTENTLY DISCLOSED HAS NOW BEEN INFORMED OF THAT?----------- STEIDLE:- HE HAS BEEN INFORMED, SIR.- AND I WILL GO DOWN ON- WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK AND-PRESENT OUR INVESTIGATION TO THEM.- THAT- PARTICULAR CONTRACTOR ISSUED A AGENCY PROTEST -- RIGHTFULLY-SO, IN MY- MIND.---------- STEIDLE:- I WILL PRESENT ALL THE INFORMATION TO HIM, AND TELL HIM- WHAT OUR INVESTIGATION IN-IMPACT OF THE DISCLOSURE OF THAT MATERIAL- HAS.---------- LEVIN:- SO, WE REALLY DON'T KNOW YET WHAT THE EFFECT IS GOING TO- BE.- IT'S NOT BEEN RESOLVED-YET?---------- STEIDLE:- NO, SIR, IT IS NOT.- NO, SIR, IT IS NOT.- BY WEDNESDAY- I'LL HAVE IT FINISHED.---------- LEVIN:- IF YOU'D LET US KNOW THE OUTCOME OF THAT FOR THE RECORD-, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL.---------- STEIDLE:- WILCO.- YES, SIR.---------- WARNER:- JUST AS A FOLLOW-ON, SENATOR.- YOUR PROGRAM HAS RECENTLY- PROGRESSED FROM-CONCEPT EXPLORATION INTO THE REQUIREMENTS GENERATION- AND VALIDATION PROCESS.- WHAT WILL BE THE-CRITICAL TWO OR THREE EVENTS- BETWEEN NOW AND THE AWARD OF THE EMD TO PRODUCE TEST AIRCRAFT?- WHAT- HAS TO GO RIGHT, WHAT COULD GO WRONG?---------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.- WE'RE STARTING...---------- WARNER:- GREAT STAFF QUESTION.---------- STEIDLE:- YES, SIR.---------- STEIDLE:- WE'RE DOING-BUSINESS DIFFERENTLY--SENATOR.- WE- HAVE THIS GROUP OF-COST/PERFORMANCE TRADES.- IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE- AT THAT LEVEL BEFORE. INDUSTRY IS A FULL PARTNER OF-THIS.- WE- ARE TRADING OFF THE REQUIREMENTS BASE THAT EACH ONE OF THE- SERVICES HAVE ALLOWED US A-LARGE ENVELOPE TO WORK IN AS WE PULL- IT DOWN.---------- MOVING INTO THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE, WE'LL AWARD THE TWO CONTRACTS- TO THE TWO TEAMS.- THEY-WILL HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR ABILITY TO- BUILD THIS AIRPLANE WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF COMMONALITY-,WHICH- SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE COST, DEMONSTRATE HOVER IN TRANSITION-, DEMONSTRATE CARRIER-SUITABLE FLYING QUALITY, AND CONTINUE ON WITH THE- GROUND DEMONSTRATION OF TECHNOLOGY-MATURATION.- WE NEED TO MATURE THE- TECHNOLOGIES BEFORE WE GO INTO THE EMD PROGRAM.- THAT'LL BE-DONE.-------------- AND OUR ORD WILL BE COMPLETELY FINISHED BY THE YEAR '-----AND- THAT'S A PROCESS IN ITSELF THAT-IS BEING DONE IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD IN- MODELING AND SIMULATION.- SO IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM-THE WAY WE- HAVE DONE BUSINESS IN THE PAST.------------ LEVIN:- LET ME GET TO THE DATA LINK ISSUE ON THE FIGHTER- AIRCRAFT, GENERAL.- APPARENTLY, GETTING-TACTICAL DATA LINKS INTO THE- FIGHTERS HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT ISSUE FOR THE AIR FORCE FOR A NUMBER OF- YEARS.- SOME HAVE THE PERCEPTION THAT THE AIR FORCE HAS RESISTED- ADDING THAT CAPABILITY, NOT JUST-BECAUSE OF COST BUT BECAUSE OF- CULTURAL BARRIERS.- I'M CONVINCED THAT THE ADDED SITUATIONAL AWARE- THAT SHARING THE DATA AMONG VARIOUS PLATFORMS WOULD PROVIDE HAS- TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL FOR US.---------- ARE THERE FIGHTER DATA LINKS INCLUDED IN THE COM-LINKS THAT THE- CHIEF OF STAFF HAS ADDED TO HIS-LIST, DO YOU KNOW?----------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR, THERE ARE.---------- LEVIN:- AND IS THE...---------- EBERHART:- IT'S UNDER THE GUISE OF SENSOR SHOOTER, AND UNDER- THAT...---------- LEVIN:- WOULD YOU JUST SAY THAT AGAIN?---------- EBERHART:- IT'S UNDER THE TITLE SENSOR TO SHOOTER, AND UNDER THAT- ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE SO-CONCERNED OF AND SO ARE WE.- AND YOU'RE- SPOT ON, IT WAS A CULTURAL PROBLEM FOR A WHILE, AND IN MY-VIEW WE- MIGHT HAVE HID BEHIND THE MONEY ISSUE.- WE'RE COMMITTED NOW, WE- REALIZE HOW-IMPORTANT IT IS TO JOINT WAR FIGHTING, AND WE'RE MOVING- AHEAD.---------- LEVIN:- ALL RIGHT.- AND GENERAL MAGNUS, IS THE MARINES COMMITTED- TO ALSO ADOPT THAT-CAPABILITY?---------- MAGNUS:- SENATOR, WE ARE.- WE, OF COURSE, FIELD OUR AIRCRAFT IN A- COMMON LONG-RANGE PLAN-WITH THE UNITED STATES NAVY AND A PROGRAM THAT- IS UNIQUE TO US, HAVING TAKEN OVER THE ADVANCED-TECHNICAL AIR- RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEM.-- FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE ADDED A DATA LINK POD TO- THAT-SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN IT IS FIELDED IT WILL NOT ONLY GIVE US THE- CAPABILITY TO DOWNLOAD THE-RECONNAISSANCE WHEN WE GET TO THE GROUND-, BUT WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE NEAR REAL TIME BURSTS OF THAT-CRITICAL- TACTICAL BATTLEFIELD INFORMATION TO JOINT FORCE COMMANDERS AND FORCES- AT SEA.------------ LEVIN:- OK.- ADMIRAL MCGINN DO YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT?-------------- MCGINN:- YES, SIR.- WE ARE ALREADY FLYING IN MANY OF OUR AIRCRAFT- INCLUDING THE F-14 D, THE-J-TDS, OR LINK-16, WHICH WE HAVE FOUND- PROVIDES TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED SITUATIONAL-AWARENESS AND IT ALLOWS- AIRCRAFT IN A PARTICULAR STRIKE PACKAGE OR FIGHTER SWEEP TO COORDINATE- THEIR EFFORTS IN A MUCH BETTER WAY THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN ABLE TO DO- BEFORE.---------- I'D LIKE TO ALSO SAY THAT A MARINE PROGRAM THAT OFFERS A GREAT- DEAL OF PROMISE THAT HAS BEEN-FIELDED AND PROTOTYPED IS A- DIGITALIZATION CALLED AUTOMATIC TARGET HAND-OFF SYSTEM WHICH-ALLOWS A- MARINE ON THE GROUND UNDER FIRE TO DIGITALLY COMMUNICATE RIGHT INTO- THE AIRCRAFT-WEAPONS SYSTEM, IN THIS CASE THE AV-8B, BUT IT WILL- -- WE'RE LOOKING TO FIELD IT IN ALL OF-OUR-FA-18S AS WELL.- YOU KNOW-, ACTUALLY PUT THE SYMBOL OF THE TARGET THAT THE MARINE LANCE CORPORAL- IN THE TRENCHES WANTS TO HIT, NEEDS-TO HIT, RIGHT ON THE HEADS-UP- DISPLAY OF THE FIGHTER AIRCRAFT OR-THE AV-8B.- AND IT IS A TREMENDOUS- LEAP FORWARD IN CLOSE AIR SUPPORT CAPABILITY FOR THE FUTURE.- AND- GENERAL MAGNUS MIGHT WANT TO COMMENT FURTHER ON THAT, SIR.-------------- MAGNUS:- AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY SHIPMATE, ADMIRAL- MCGINN, THE-AUTOMATIC TARGET HAND-OFF SYSTEM BECAUSE EXACTLY RIGHT-, OUR FORWARD OBSERVERS, FORWARD AIR-CONTROLLERS ON THE GROUND WILL BE- ABLE TO TAKE THE STANDARD 9 LINE IMMEDIATE AIR SUPPORT REQUEST-AND- BEAM IT UP VIA DATA LINK JUST AS THE ADMIRAL SAID, SO THE PILOT IN A- STRIKE AIRCRAFT THAT IS LINE-OF SIGHT, BUT OUT OF VISUAL RANGE WILL BE- ABLE TO STAND OFF FROM THE THREAT, RECEIVE THE INFORMATION-AND ROLL IN- ON THE TARGET. COUPLING THAT CAPABILITY WITH THE EMERGING 1760 BUS DIGITAL- CAPABILITY-IN WEAPONS LIKE JDAM AND JSOW, WE ARE LITERALLY GOING TO BE- ABLE TO DELIVER CLOSE AIR SUPPORT-TO TROOPS ON THE GROUND AT NIGHT- THROUGH THE WEATHER IN THE FUTURE WITH PRECISION, ACCURACY-,BECAUSE OF- THE CAPABILITY TO PASS THAT INFORMATION UP AND THEN LOAD IT DOWN INTO- THE WEAPONS.---------- LEVIN:- ARE WE FUNDING THAT PROGRAM AS MUCH AS WE -- IN A ROBUST- WAY, WE, IN THIS BUDGET?---------- MCGINN:- I'D LOVE TO GET AN ANSWER FOR YOU FOR THE RECORD SENATOR- ON THAT.---------- LEVIN:- AND GENERAL, I TAKE IT FROM YOUR ANSWER THAT THE AIR- FORCE IS NOW COMMITTED TO-HAVING THE SAME KIND OF RELIANCE ON THE- TACTICAL DATA LINKS IN IT'S FIGHTER AIRCRAFT AS WE'VE JUST-HEARD- DESCRIBED BY THE NAVY AND THE MARINES.---------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR, TO PUT A LITTLE MORE BLUNTLY BUT YOU- REFERENCED IT EARLIER.- WE'RE OVER-OUR CULTURAL PROBLEM THAT WE HAD.- AND THEN TO TAKE IT ONE STEP FURTHER, EXACTLY WHAT THEY JUST- DISCUSSED, THIS INTERFACE BETWEEN THE DIGITALIZATION OF THE GROUND- BATTLE AND THE AIR BATTLE IS KEY.- IN THE PAST WHEN WE DID LOOK AT IT-, WE LOOKED AT IT MORE OF JUST DIGITALIZATION OF THE AIR, AND DATA-LINK- IN THE AIR.- AND WORKING THAT TOGETHER IS HOW WE REALLY BECOME- EFFICIENT.- AND THEN, OH, BY-THE WAY, REDUCE FRATRICIDE.---------- LEVIN:- WELL, IT'S GOOD NEWS TO HEAR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING-, AND THE BUDGET NUMBERS-WILL BE HELPFUL IF YOU'LL SUBMIT THOSE.----------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR.---------- LEVIN:- BECAUSE THAT -- THAT'S AN AREA OF TOP PRIORITY FOR THIS- COMMITTEE AND HAS BEEN FOR A-NUMBER OF YEARS.---------- WARNER:- GENERAL MAGNUS, WOULD YOU PLEASE PASS ON TO YOUR SENIOR- CHIEF OF AVIATION OUR-BEST WISHES FOR A SPEEDY RECOVERY FROM HIS- OPERATION AND SO FORTH?---------- MAGNUS:- THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.- GENERAL BLOT IS RECOVERING- WELL.- HE HAS HAD-SHOULDER SURGERY, FOR YOUR INFORMATION.- AND THE- REASON WHY HE'S NOT HERE IS OBVIOUSLY HE'S FAIRLY-UNCOMFORTABLE- -- DOING VERY WELL BUT COULDN'T GET INTO HIS UNIFORM.- SO HE SENT ME TO- SPEAK TO-YOU THIS MORNING.----------- WARNER:- GLAD TO HAVE YOU. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR CV-22 AND THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN- EXPRESSED BY THE RETIRING CHIEF OF THE U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS- COMMAND.- WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO-ENLIGHTEN US ON THAT?- HAVE YOU READ THAT ARTICLE?- IF NOT, I'LL SEND IT UP SO- YOU CAN SKIM IT FOR A-MINUTE.---------- MAGNUS:- I'M NOT SURE WHICH ARTICLE TO WHICH YOU'RE REFERRING- -- ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN-SEVERAL THAT I'VE READ IN THE LAST FEW DAYS.------------ WARNER:- WELL, LET'S WORK OFF THE THE SAME BASELINE, AND I'LL GO- TO ANOTHER QUESTION.---------- MAGNUS:- MR. CHAIRMAN, I AM FAMILIAR WITH THIS ARTICLE.-------------- WARNER:- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD THEN?---------- MAGNUS:- THE JOINT V-22 PROGRAM, I BELIEVE, IS A SUCCESS STORY-, AND OF COURSE LIKE MANY-OTHER LARGE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN ENGINEERING- AND MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT WE'RE CONSTANTLY-CHALLENGED BY- CONSTRAINED FISCAL RESOURCES.---------- WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAD A DEFENSE ACQUISITION BOARD- AND A DEFENSE RESOURCES-BOARD IN 1994 JOINING THE U.S. AIR FORCE- SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND REQUIREMENT FOR A SPECIAL-OPERATIONS FORCE- CV-22 TO THE MARINE CORPS MV-22, THE ESTIMATE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF- THE-CV-22 -- THE U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND VARIANT -- WAS- $550 MILLION.---------- AND THAT ESTIMATE CAME FROM THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, I- BELIEVE IT WAS AERONAUTICAL-SYSTEMS COMMAND.- SUBSEQUENT TO THAT, THE- DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY COMMITTED, WITH-DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY RDT&E- MONEY, TO FUND THAT $550 MILLION PROFILE THAT WE BELIEVED-WOULD BE- ADEQUATE TO PROVIDE TO TAKE THE MV-22 BASELINE AIRCRAFT INTO A SPECIAL- OPERATIONS-VARIANT.------------ IN THE SUCCEEDING TWO YEARS, SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND HAS- DEFINED ITS CONFIGURATION-MUCH MORE FINELY THAN THEY HAD IN '-----WE- -- THE PROGRAM OFFICE AND NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS-COMMAND SUBMITTED A- REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT TO THE BELL-BOEING- JOINT-TEAM.---------- AND ESSENTIALLY, THE RESPONSE FROM THE CONTRACTORS CAME IN AT- APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION-OVER WHAT WAS ALLOCATED IN THE BUDGET.- CLEARLY, THAT PRESENTED MORE THAN A MINOR CHALLENGE-BECAUSE WE DID NOT- HAVE, IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, THAT ADDITIONAL $200 MILLION.-------------- AND SOMETHING HAD TO MOVE, AND WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZED THE- SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND-REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS THEIR NEED FOR A- FISCAL YEAR 2005 IOC.---------- THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF MEETINGS BETWEEN THE ASSISTANT- SECRETARY OF THE NAVY FOR-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MR. DOUGLAS, AND- THE U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND-REPRESENTATIVES ON ALTERNATIVES IN- WHICH WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE ALTERNATIVE AND-WHICH WITHIN- THE NAVY'S COMMITMENT TO THE $550 MILLION WE CAN -- WITH IDEAS SUCH AS- PREPLANNED PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT -- PROVIDE EXACTLY THE KIND OF AIRCRAFT- THAT SPECIAL OPERATIONS-COMMAND AND OUR AIR FORCE WING MEN NEED TO BE- ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR CRITICAL MISSION.----------- MAGNUS:- THERE ARE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN SPECIAL OPERATIONS- COMMAND AND THE-UNITED STATES NAVY.- OSD HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE- OVERARCHING TEAM THAT IS WATCHING THIS-PROGRAM CLOSELY.- AND WE HAVE- BEEN, OF COURSE, IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR AIR FORCE WINGMEN.-WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE SOLUTION THAT WILL ALLOW US TO- EXECUTE TO OUR $550 MILLION-COMMITMENT-AND PROVIDE THE AIR FORCE- SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND THE AIRCRAFT THAT THEY NEED-WHEN THEY NEED- IT.----------- WARNER:- THAT'S REASSURING AND DOUGLAS IS A VERY ABLE MAN-, TRAINED HERE BY THIS-COMMISSION, AND I HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF- CONFIDENCE, AS DO OTHER MEMBERS.---------- DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A QUESTION OR I'LL...---------- LEVIN:- JUST ON THE V-22 ISSUE.- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME, ANOTHER- PRESS REPORT RELATING TO-TESTING RESULTS ON THE V-22 WHICH INDICATES- SOME PROBLEMS, UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF DOWN DRAFT OR-PROP WASH BELOW THE- AIRCRAFT OPERATING, WHEN IT OPERATES AT HOVER.- IS THERE GOING TO BE- AN-OPPORTUNITY DURING THE OPERATIONAL TESTING TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR- NOT THAT CONDITION IS REAL.---------- MAGNUS:- SENATOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION.- WE HAVE- BEEN AWARE -- AND I-SAY WE IN A PERSONAL SENSE -- HAVE BEEN AWARE OF- THE DOWN WASH EFFECT OF TILT ROTORS, NOT ONLY-FROM OUR EXPERIENCE WITH- HIGH VELOCITY DOWN WASH AIRCRAFT SUCH AS V-STAL , BUT WHEN I WAS A- MAJOR I WAS ON THE JOINT NASA-ARMY-NAVY-AIR FORCE AND INDUSTRY TEAM- THAT WENT OUT TO NASA-AMES AND MODELED THE AIRCRAFT THAT WAS THEN- BEING DESIGNED CALL JVX, WHICH HAS SINCE BECOME-THE V-22 OSPREY TILT- ROTOR.---------- WE WERE WELL AWARE THAT THE VELOCITY AND THE FOOTPRINT, IF YOU- WILL, OF THE AIR THAT IS MOVING-DOWN WAS GOING TO BE MORE THAN WE HAVE- IN THE CURRENT MEDIUM HELICOPTERS, BUT, QUITE FRANKLY-,COMPARABLE TO- HEAVY LIFT HELICOPTERS, SUCH AS THE CH-53 ECHO; DIFFERENT, BUT- COMPARABLE TO IT.---------- IN OTHER WORDS, THAT WE KNEW THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE OPERATING IN- THE VICINITY UNDERNEATH THE-AIRCRAFT WOULD HAVE A HIGH VELOCITY DOWN- WASH.- AND WE ANTICIPATED THIS, SO THIS IS NOT A-SURPRISE. AS A RESULT OF THAT, DURING OUR OPERATIONAL TESTS WE HAVE JUST- COMPLETED OPERATION TEST-2B, WHICH FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE.- WE BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW GROUND COMBAT MARINES-,SAILORS AND SOLDIERS- WILL OPERATE UNDER AIRCRAFT THAT ARE BEING FLOWN BY AIR FORCE, NAVY- AND-MARINE CORPS PILOTS, AND WE BELIEVE, AND I HAVE PERSONALLY READ- THE COMMENTS OF MARINE-HELICOPTER SUPPORT TEAM MEMBERS, LANCE- CORPORALS WHO HAVE WORKED UNDER THESE AIRCRAFT, WHO-BASICALLY SAY IT- IS COMPARABLE TO THEIR CH-53 ECHO EXPERIENCE.---------- WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS, JUST LIKE THE CH-53 ECHO, WHICH WENT- THROUGH IT OP EVAL IN 1979, AND-THERE WERE WORDS IN THE REPORT THERE- THAT DESCRIBED IT AS DANGEROUS AND REQUIRING SPECIAL-EQUIPMENT THAT WE- DIDN'T HAVE IN 1979, WE WILL FIND TACTICS, TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES- THAT WILL-ALLOW US TO SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THIS AIRCRAFT.- WE HAVE ANTICIPATED THIS PROBLEM AND WE-ARE WORKING WITH OUR- JOINT WINGMEN ON THIS AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE WHO WILL ACTUALLY BE THE- REAL-CUSTOMERS OF THE AIRCRAFT, AND THAT'S THE TROOPS THAT'LL BE IN- THE BACK.- I'M CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL-BE RESOLVED.---------- LEVIN:- THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.---------- WARNER:- THIS IS A QUESTION TO ALL THREE.- WE'LL ASK GENERAL- EBERHART, ADMIRAL MCGINN AND-GENERAL MAGNUS TO ANSWER.------------- WARNER:- OVER THE YEARS, THE COMMITTEE HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE- INTEREST IN AIRBORNE.- PART OF-THIS HAS BEEN ADDRESSED, BUT THE- SENATOR AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NOTHING LEFT IN THIS- UNTOUCHED. THE COMMITTEE HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN AIRBORNE ELECTRONIC- WARFARE.- AN-INITIATIVE BY THE COMMITTEE A FEW YEARS AGO WAS- ENCOURAGED BY THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TO-CONSOLIDATE AIRBORNE EW INTO- ONE PROGRAM AND TO ADEQUATELY FUND THAT PROGRAM. TODAY WE HAVE-AN AGED EA-6B FLEET WHICH -- WITH MUCH THE SAME- CAPABILITY AS IN THE YEARS PAST, WHILE THE THREAT-EXPANDS AND BECOMES- MORE SOPHISTICATED.- AT THE SAME TIME, THE AIR FORCE PLANS TO RETIRE- EF------WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF AIRBORNE ELECTRONIC WARFARE TO YOUR- TACTICAL AVIATION PROGRAM?- WHAT NEAR-TERM CAPABILITIES DO YOU HAVE TO- ADDRESS THAT THREAT, GENERAL, TO THE EXTENT YOU HAVEN'T-COVERED IT- ALREADY?---------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR.- OBVIOUSLY, AIRBORNE ECM IS VERY IMPORTANT- TO OUR PROGRAM AND THE-SURVIVAL OF OUR PILOTS AND OUR EFFECTIVENESS ON- THE BATTLEFIELD.---------- WE SUPPORT THE EFFORTS THAT ARE ONGOING TO BUILD THE EA-6B FLEET- UP, MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO-IT, TO PROVIDE FOR OUR JOINT ECM- REQUIREMENTS.- WE'RE PART OF THE SOLUTION THERE, AND NOT PART OF-THE- PROBLEM.- WE'RE COMMITTED TO IT.------------ HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME, I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE AN- INSURANCE POLICY THERE IN THAT AS-WE DRAW DOWN THE EF-111S, WE KEEP- THEM AROUND TILL THE -- THE NUMBER'S CLASSIFIED -- BUT-SOMETIME IN- '-----WE CAN AN INCREASED CREW-TO-AIRCRAFT RATIO, AND THE AIRPLANES- THAT WE DO RETIRE-WE DON'T TAKE THE DATE AS MOTH THEM, WE LEAVE ON- THE RAMP.---------- SO IF THERE IS A HICCOUGH OR WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT, THEN WE CAN- FALL BACK ON IT.- BUT WE'RE-COMMITTED TO IT.- WE WANT IT TO WORK.- WE- KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.---------- YOU KNOW, AND THE COMMITTEE KNOWS AS WELL AS I DO, THAT WE HAVE--TO APPROACH THIS PROBLEM-FROM MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. -IN ADDITION TO- AIRBORNE ECM, IF WE HAVE BETTER BATTLESPACE AWARENESS-IN TERMS OF- INCREASED INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE SO WE KNOW- WHERE THE-THREATS ARE, WE KNOW-WHAT THE THREATS CAN DO, WE KNOW HOW TO- EITHER ATTACK THEM OR AVOID THEM-,USING STEALTH AND USING PGM.-------------- WE ALSO HAVE THE NONLETHAL PART OF THIS, AND EVENTUALLY SOME DAY- WE THINK THERE WILL BE-INFORMATION WARFARE WAYS TO GET IN AND HELP US- SURVIVE IN THE BATTLEFIELD OF THE FUTURE.- AND WE-THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- TO WORK ALL OF THESE ASPECTS, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO.-------------- WARNER:- ADMIRAL MCGINN?------------- MCGINN:- I FULLY CONCUR WITH GENERAL EBERHART'S REMARKS, SENATOR-, AND I'D LIKE TO JUST ADD A-FEW OF MY OWN.- THE EA-6B IS, AS MATURE AN- AIRFRAME AND ENGINE COMBINATION AS- IT IS, STILL ENJOYS A GREAT DEAL OF- SERVICE LIFE THAT IS AVAILABLE TO IT.---------- WE HAVE AN ACTIVE AND ONGOING OPERATIONAL SAFETY IMPROVEMENT- PROGRAM THAT IS CLOSELY-MONITORED BY ENGINEERS AND AIR CREWMEN AND- MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL IN THE FIELD AS WELL AS AT THE-VARIOUS SYSTEMS- COMMANDS. IT IS A TRULY JOINT PROGRAM IN THAT LATER THIS MONTH, THE THREE- SERVICE-CHIEFS WILL SIGN A MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT THAT WILL SOLIDIFY- THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE-IN MAKING THE EA-6B FLEET TRULY THE- NATION'S TACTICAL EW FORCE. I RECEIVED A REPORT FROM THE WING-COMMANDER -- THE EA-6B WING- COMMANDER -- TWO WEEKS AGO AS WELL AS ONE OF THE EA-6B-SQUADRON COS- WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM DEPLOYMENT OVER IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.- THEY- ARE-ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT THE PROGRAM IS ON TRACK. IT IS PROPERLY RESOURCED IN TERMS OF AIRFRAMES-,THE EQUIPMENT- UPGRADES THAT ARE GOING IN NOW AND ARE PLANNED, AS WELL AS THE AIR- CREW UPGRADES-AS WELL. WE HAVE AIR FORCE AIR CREWS FLYING IN EA-6BS IN TRAINING AS WELL- AS IN OPERATIONS, AND-THEY HAVE ALSO COORDINATED AT THE EA-6B WING- LEVEL WITH ALL OF THE SERVICES AND ALL OF THE UNIFIED-COMMANDERS IN- CHIEFS AND THEIR STAFFS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GLOBAL COVERAGE EXISTS- IN TERMS OF-FORWARD PRESENCE AS WELL AS A VERY RESPONSIVE REACTION- CAPABILITY SHOULD THAT BE REQUIRED IN ANY-TYPE OF A REGIONAL- CONTINGENCY.---------- WARNER:- GENERAL.------------- MAGNUS:- MR. CHAIRMAN, I AGREE WITH THE REMARKS OF GENERAL -EBERHART AND ADMIRAL-MCGINN.- THE MARINE CORPS, AS YOU KNOW, HAS FOUR- SQUADRONS OF PROWLERS IN THE ICAP--2CONFIGURATION.- WE ALONG WITH THE- NAVY ARE OPERATING OUR AIRCRAFT TO THE BLOCK-89 ALPHA-CONFIGURATION.-------------- AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER IN THE HEARING, MARINES ARE ON THE GROUND- TODAY IN AVIANO AND EARLIER-LAST YEAR WHEN THERE WAS THE NEED TO BRING- ADDITIONAL TACTICAL AIRCRAFT INTO THE THEATERS TO SUPPORT-STRIKES THAT- WERE NEEDED ON THE GROUND, MARINE SQUADRONS DEPLOYED WITHIN 48 HOURS- AND WAS-FLYING COMBAT MISSIONS ON THE THIRD DAY FROM THE TIME THAT- THEY GOT THE TO ORDER FROM THE JOINT-CHIEFS OF STAFFS.------------ WE WERE INTEGRATED WITH THE NAVY IN CARRIER DEPLOYMENTS AS WELL- AS BASING OUT OF OUR BASE AT-IWAKUNI, JAPAN.- WE WILL SUPPORT THE- UNITED STATES NAVY IN FULFILLING OUR IMPORTANT-RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE- DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY TO PROVIDE AIRCRAFT NOT ONLY FOR OUR OWN- SUPPORT-REQUIREMENTS BUT TO SUPPORT THE UNITED SATES AIR FORCE AND OUR- ALLIES.------------- OF COURSE, THE UNITED STATES NAVY HAS RECEIVED A BUDGETARY FYSYP- UP AND SOME STRUCTURE TO-TAKE UP THE AIR FORCE'S EF-111 MISSION AS- THOSE AIRCRAFT STAND DOWN.- NEVERTHELESS, AND-CONSISTENT WITH THE- TACTICAL AVIATION INTEGRATION MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT THAT THE- COMMANDANT OF THE MARINE CORPS AND THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS HAVE- IN GENERAL ABOUT ALL-OF OUR STRIKE AND ELECTRONIC WARFARE AIRCRAFT, WE- WILL SUPPORT THE UNITED STATES NAVY IN FULFILLING-OUR COMMITMENTS TO- THE NATION.---------- WARNER:- SENATOR LEVIN.- GENTLEMEN, I'M GOING TO- HAVE TO ABSENT- MYSELF AND MY-DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE WILL WRAP UP THE HEARING.- THANK- YOU VERY MUCH.---------- LEVIN:- GENERAL, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT F-16S FOR A MINUTE.- WE'VE GOT A NEW DEFINITION-OF SERVICE LIFE OF THE F-16S WHICH IS NOW- DRIVING US TO PURCHASE SOME ADDITIONAL F-16S.- AND-THERE'S A REAL- QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO GIVEN OUR OTHER- NEEDS IN THE AIR-FORCE.- BUT LET ME TRY TO WORK THROUGH THIS NUMBER- WITH YOU.-- WE HAVE A 20 WING FIGHTER FORCE-NOW AND I GATHER THE- PORTION OF THAT FORCE THAT IS MADE OF F-16S IS SOMEWHAT MORE THAN- HALF.- DO-YOU KNOW OFF HAND IF THAT'S CORRECT?---------- EBERHART:- SIR, THAT SOUNDS CORRECT.- I'LL GET THE NUMBER HERE AS- YOU...---------- LEVIN:- OK, WELL, THAN MAYBE I BETTER GET THESE NUMBERS FOR THE- RECORD.---------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR.---------- LEVIN:- LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I NEED, BECAUSE YOU MAY NOT HAVE- THEM AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.- WHAT I NEED TO KNOW IS WHAT WAS THE F--16 REQUIREMENT WHEN WE HAD A 26-WING FORCE, WHAT WAS-THE F-16 REQUIREMENT- NOW, WHAT WOULD IT HAVE BEEN HAD WE GONE TO A 36-WING FORCE, WHICH WAS- THE GOAL DURING THE EARLY '90S?--------- THOSE THREE ITEMS I NEED AND HOW MANY F-16S WOULD HAVE MADE UP- THOSE THREE DIFFERENT-FORCE STRUCTURES.- THEN I NEED YOU TO TRANSLATE- THAT INTO BOTH THE OLD DEFINITION AND THE NEW-DEFINITION OF SERVICE- LIFE IN TERMS OF HOW MANY AVAILABLE F-16S WE GOT.- AND THAT'S- SOMETHING-YOU CAN PROVIDE US FOR THE RECORD.---------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR.----------- LEVIN:- DO YOU KNOW IN GENERAL WHETHER OR NOT THE NUMBER OF F--16 FIGHTER WING-EQUIVALENCE HAS CHANGED OVER THE RECENT PAST?- DO YOU- KNOW THAT OFFHAND?--------- EBERHART:- SIR, IT IS CHANGED, OBVIOUSLY, AS WE'VE DRAWN DOWN- SOME F-16S, AND WE CAN-THINK OF WINGS LIKE THE 474TH AT NELLIS AND- OTHER WINGS THAT HAVE DRAWN DOWN.- AND AS AIRPLANES-HAVE AGED, IT'S- CERTAINLY CHANGED, ALTHOUGH THE OTHER FIGHTER FORCE STRUCTURE IS- CHANGED, TOO.---------- SO I DON'T HAVE ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IN- TERMS OF PROPORTION OF FORCE-IS IN TERMS OF CHANGE, BUT WE'D LIKE TO- SHOW THAT TO YOU FOR THE RECORD AND THE PROPORTION OF THE-DIFFERENT- BLOCKS, HOW THEY'VE CHANGED...----------- LEVIN:- ALL RIGHT.---------- EBERHART:- ...BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT COMPLICATES THIS ISSUE, AS YOU- KNOW.---------- LEVIN:- RIGHT.- THAT'S FINE.- ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE COALITION- FORCE ENHANCEMENT-PROGRAM?- DOES THAT STRIKE A BELL?---------- EBERHART:- I THINK I...NO, SIR.---------- LEVIN:- OK.- THIS WAS A PROGRAM THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE F-16S- SOME IMPROVED-CAPABILITY, UPGRADED THEM, ADDED SOME SERVICE LIFE.- AND- WE CAN FIND THAT IN A DIFFERENT WAY.---------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR, I AM FAMILIAR WITH THAT PROGRAM.-------------- LEVIN:- OK.- WAS IT OUR PLAN TO USE THAT PROGRAM AND SELL THOSE- UPGRADED F-16 TO OUR ALLIES?----------- EBERHART:- SIR, OUR HOPE WAS TO DO JUST THAT AND THEN HAVE A- DEVICE OR A PROCEDURE WHERE-THAT MONEY IS SUPPOSED TO BE RETURNED TO- THE TREASURY WOULD BE RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES AIR-FORCE TO BUY- THESE ATTRITION RESERVE AIRPLANES THAT WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED.-------------- LEVIN:- DO YOU KNOW THE COST OF ADDING 4000 HOURS OF SERVICE LIFE- TO A PLANE UNDER THAT-PROGRAM?---------- EBERHART:- NO, SIR, I DO NOT KNOW.- ONE OF OUR BIG PROBLEMS RIGHT- NOW IS THAT AS WE'VE-LOOKED AROUND ON THIS AND HOW MUCH WE WOULD HAVE- TO SELL THOSE FOR, I THINK THE BRUTAL FACTS ARE-THERE ARE NO BUYERS.-------------- LEVIN:- THEY WANT TO...---------- EBERHART:- JUST AS SOON HAVE A NEW AIRPLANE.---------- LEVIN:- ALL RIGHT.- NOW, ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE JSTARS BUDGET- REQUEST IN THE CURRENT-BUDGET?---------- EBERHART:- YES, SIR.----------- LEVIN:- AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE BUDGET WOULD CUT THE JSTARS- PROCUREMENT IN HALF DURING-FISCAL YEARS '99, 2000, AND 2001, BUYING- ONE INSTEAD OF TWO DURING THOSE FISCAL YEARS?---------- EBERHART:- SIR, MY RECOLLECTION WAS THAT WE DID, IN FACT, MOVE- ONE AIRPLANE RIGHT.- I WASN'T-AWARE THAT WE MOVED THREE RIGHT.- I- THOUGHT WE MOVED ONE RIGHT.- I'LL HAVE TO PROVIDE THAT FOR THE-RECORD.-------------- LEVIN:- CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE J-STARS WAS- IN THE PERSIAN GULF WAR-,IN BOSNIA?---------- LEVIN:- ARE THE CINCS INTERESTED IN MORE JSTARS?---------- EBERHART:- SIR, THE CINCS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THE JSTARS- PROGRAM AS IT EXISTS TODAY-AND THE PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS AS WE GET ON- THROUGH THE PRODUCTION LINE.---------- OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU KNOW, THE BIRD THAT WE HAVE TODAY AND THE- PRODUCTION BIRDS WILL BE MUCH-MORE CAPABLE THAN THE BIRD THAT WE HAD- IN THE PERSIAN GULF.- AND THAT -- WE WERE ALL AMAZED BY-WHAT IT WAS- ABLE TO DO IN SUCH SHORT NOTICE.---------- I THINK THAT IN BOSNIA TODAY, PEOPLE ARE IMPRESSED WITH WHAT IT'S- DOING, ALTHOUGH IT'S A-DIFFERENT SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY-, WE DON'T HAVE A POOL TABLE, IF YOU WILL, LIKE WE HAD-IN DESERT STORM- OR LIKE WE IMAGINED IN THE CENTRAL REGION OF EUROPE.---------- BUT WE HAVE TOOLS WHERE WE CAN GO AND TAKE THIS AND SHOW THE CINC- THAT IF YOU BRING-JSTARS HERE AND YOU PUT IT IN THIS ORBIT, THIS IS- WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE AROUND-SARAJEVO.- THIS IS WHAT- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE.- SO THAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE- THERE AND-HE FULLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THIS TOOL WILL BRING TO HIM AS A- CINC. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID-BEFORE WE DEPLOYED JSTARS, SO IT'S- LIVING UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS, AND IT'S ALLOWING US TO USE IT IN-WAYS- IN PEACEKEEPING AND PEACE MAKING THAT WE HADN'T ENVISIONED USING IN A- MAJOR REGIONAL-CONTINGENCY. SO EVERYBODY'S VERY IMPRESSED WITH WHAT THEY SEE IN TERMS OF- JSTARS NOW.- AND-FRANKLY, THE MOVE RIGHT WAS AN AFFORDABILITY ISSUE TO- MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WOULD FIT.----------- LEVIN:- WELL, THAT'S WHAT TROUBLES ME IS THAT WE'VE GOT A NEW- TECHNOLOGY AND A NEW-PLATFORM, WHICH IS WORKING EXTREMELY WELL FROM- EVERYTHING WE CAN LEARN, AND WE'RE MOVING THAT-TO THE RIGHT FOR- AFFORDABILITY REASONS.---------- AND THEN, WE'RE SPENDING MONEY BUYING F-16S AND F-15S FOR- ATTRITION RESERVES, WHICH ARE-ONLY CREATED BY THE CHANGING THE PROGRAM- LIFE EXPECTANCY OF PLANES.- AND WHERE PLANES COULD BE-UPGRADES QUITE- EASILY, AS A MATTER OF FACT, IF NECESSARY IN ORDER TO EXTEND THAT- PROGRAM LIFE.---------- I MEAN, IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THERE'S A DISCONNECT HERE WHERE WE'VE- GOT A REAL NEED OF A NEW-TECHNOLOGY THAT IS PROVING ITSELF EVERY DAY- IN BOSNIA AND HAS PROVEN ITSELF IN -- OVER MANY, MANY-MONTHS IN THE- PERSIAN GULF, AND THAT WE'RE DELAYING AND USING MONEY TO CREATE A- RESERVE WHICH-REALLY, IT SEEMS TO ME, IS NOT A REALISTIC NEED WHEN YOU- CONSIDER THE FACT THAT WE'VE REDUCED THE-NUMBER QUITE DRAMATICALLY OF- HOW MANY F-16S WE'RE GOING TO NEED BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION IN-FIGHTER- WINGS.---------- SO, TO ME, IT'S A PRIORITY WHICH IS MISPLACED, BUT I'M NOT ASKING- YOU TO AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH-THAT SO MUCH AS I NEED FROM YOU FOR THE- RECORD THE HISTORY OF THE F-16S WHEN WE HAD 26 FIGHTER-WINGS.- NOW- THAT-IT'S DOWN TO 20 WHAT-WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD WE -- THE REQUIREMENT- -- WHAT THE-REQUIREMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD WE GONE UP TO 35?- THE IMPACT ON THE -- ON THAT REQUIREMENT-WHEN WE CHANGED THE- SERVICE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF THE F-16 AND THEN WE CAN PUT ALL THAT- TOGETHER-AND REACH OUR OWN CONCLUSION.- BUT AT LEAST THAT'S CERTAINLY- MY TENTATIVE CONCLUSION.---------- EBERHART:- SIR, WE'LL CERTAINLY PROVIDE THAT AND THE CHIEF SHARES- YOUR CONCERNS THERE.- MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY VERSUS THE F-16 BUT THE- IMPORTANCE-OF THAT JSTARS AND WE ARE RELOOKING-THAT NOW AS WE BUILD- THE-'98 TO '03 PROGRAM. ----------LEVIN:- OK.- THANK YOU.- AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION, GENERAL- MAGNUS, HAS TO DO WITH THE-C130-J AIRCRAFT, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT- YOU'D LIKE TO BEGIN BUYING A TANKER VERSION OF THAT AIRCRAFT.-IS THAT- CORRECT?---------- MAGNUS:- SENATOR, OUR CURRENT ACTIVE FORCE HAS 37 35 YEAR OLD- KC130-FS AND AN ADDITIONAL-14 SLIGHTLY YOUNGER KC130-RS.- BASED UPON- WHAT OUR PROJECTION OF THE SERVICE LIFE OF THOSE-AIRCRAFT ARE-, UNFORTUNATELY THE BULK OF THEM ARE GOING TO COME DUE FOR BLOCK SERVICE- LIFE-RETIREMENT JUST EXACTLY WHEN WE NEED TO INVEST IN AIRCRAFT LIKE- THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER AND V--22AND THE NAVY'S F/A-18EF.- WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCES C130-J- PROGRAM.- WE ARE ENORMOUSLY IMPRESSED WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE- COCKPITS AND THE AVIONICS-IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AIR CRAFT.- WE- BELIEVE IT WOULD BE PRUDENT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO-ESSENTIALLY PIGGY- BACK ON THAT PROGRAM.- FISCAL RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS HAVE NOT ENABLED US- TO DO-THAT AT THIS TIME.---------- LEVIN:- NOW YOU JUST COMPLETED, DID YOU NOT, THE MODERNIZATION OF- YOUR TACTICAL TANKERS A-COUPLE OF YEARS AGO?---------- MAGNUS:- THAT'S CORRECT.- WE STILL HAVE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT- ARE BEING MODERNIZED IN-TERMS OF RADIOS, GLOBAL-POSITION, SATELLITE -COM.- SO, THERE IS A CONTINUING STRAIN, BUT ESSENTIALLY-THAT IS- CORRECT.---------- LEVIN:- AND DESPITE THAT RECENT COMPLETION OF THAT MODERNIZATION- PROGRAM, YOU WANT TO START-BUYING SOME NEW TANKERS FOR REASONS THAT- YOU GAVE?---------- MAGNUS:- WELL, ESSENTIALLY THE MODERNIZATION THAT WE'RE TALKING- ABOUT, THAT THE SENATOR IS-REFERRING TO, IS SUB-SYSTEMS.- OUR CONCERN- IS SERVICE LIFE, FATIGUE LIFE OF THE AIRCRAFT.- THESE-AIRCRAFT ARE- 35 YEARS OLD.- WE WOULD HAVE TO SPEND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT MORE MONEY TO- BASICALLY DO A SERVICE LIFE EXTENSION ON THESE AIRCRAFT WHEN WE HAVE- AIRCRAFT THAT ARE BEING-PRODUCED FOR THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE.- THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE VERY LOW OWNERSHIP COSTS, JUST-AS OURS ARE- SPIKING.---------- SO, WE BELIEVE IT PRUDENT NOT TO INVEST IN SCHLEPPING OLD- AIRCRAFT WHEN IN FACT THEY'RE GOING TO-BE VERY COST EFFECTIVE IN TERMS- OF LIFE CYCLE COSTS AND COMMONALITY.- VERY COST EFFECTIVE- --C130-JS- BEING PRODUCED FOR OUR WING MEN IN THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO-BEING ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT- PROGRAM.----------- LEVIN:- THANK YOU ALL.- APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY.-- WE WILL- STAND ADJOURNED.---------------------------
