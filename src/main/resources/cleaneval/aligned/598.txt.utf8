HOWEVER, THE SOYUZ IS A THREE-STAGE ROCKET---------------, AND THERE'------S A STRONG ACCELERATION WHEN THE STAGES SEPARATE---------------, PARTICULARLY THE LAST ONE.------ "WHEN THAT THING WENT, IF FELT--------------- LIKE WE'------D BEEN KICKED IN THE BUTT BY A GIANT.------" ANOTHER--------------- DIFFERENCE WAS THAT HE AND MALENCHENKO WERE NOT ALLOWED TO CARRY--------------- AS MUCH WITH THEM ON THE SOYUZ FOR THEIR 6-MONTH STAY. LANDING WAS--------------- ALSO VERY DIFFERENT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SOYUZ USES AN ABLATIVE HEAT----------------SHIELD, WHICH MEANS IT BURNS UP AS THE CRAFT RE-ENTERS THE ATMOSPHERE.--------------------- "I REMEMBER LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW WATCHING PIECES OF OUR--------------- SHIP BURN OFF, WHICH IS NORMAL, BUT IT'------S STILL A LITTLE BIT--------------- DISCONCERTING------," HE SAID. THE SOYUZ ALSO USES A PARACHUTE ATTACHED--------------- TO THE SIDE OF THE SPACECRAFT. WHEN IT OPENS, THE CREW IS HANGING--------------- SIDEWISE, SPINNING IN A CIRCLE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ON--------------- THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION---------:------------------------ "THE SPACE STATION IS LIKE A BIG TUBE NOW------," LU SAID.--------------------- "IT'------S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE JETLINER.------" AS--------------- THE SOYUZ APPROACHED THE STATION, HE SAID IT------ "LOOKED LIKE--------------- A SMALL MODEL. IT REALLY FEELS LIKE YOU'------RE IN A SCIENCE FICTION--------------- MOVIE.------" WITH THE SMALLER CREW AND FEWER SUPPLIES COMING UP--------------- FROM EARTH, KEEPING EQUIPMENT OPERATIONAL WAS AN IMPORTANT PART--------------- OF THE CREW'------S DUTIES.------ "WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING--------------- ON EQUIPMENT------," HE SAID.------ "ANOTHER THING WE SPENT A LOT--------------- OF TIME DOING WAS EXERCISE.------" THE EXERCISE PAID OFF-------LU--------------- WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS TO RETURN FROM-A LONG-DURACTION--------------- SPACEFLIGHT WITH ALMOST NO LOSS IN BONE DENSITY AND LITTLE LOSS--------------- IN MUSCLE STRENGTH. THE CREW WAS GIVEN AN------ "EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION---------------------" FOR THE WORK-OUT THEY HAD TO PERFORM.------ "AND, I DID EXTRA ON----------------TOP OF THAT ON MY OWN------," LU SAID.------ "I CAME BACK WITH LESS--------------- BONE LOSS THAN ANYONE.------" HIS EXPERIENCE WILL HELP ASTRONAUTS--------------- HEALTHY WHEN THEY BEGIN MAKING THE LONG TRIPS TO OTHER WORLDS.------ "WHEN--------------- WE DO FLY TO MARS OR ASTEROIDS OR FAR AWAY LOCATIONS, IT WILL TAKE--------------- MONTHS------," HE SAID.------ "IT COULD EVEN TAKE YEARS.---------------------" LU SAID HE ENJOYED HIS STAY ON THE STATION.------ "IT WAS A BLAST--------------- FROM START TO-FINISH. TOWARDS THE ENDING I WAS WISHING IT WOULD--------------- LAST A LITTLE LONGER. I WASN'------T READY TO COME HOME YET.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" ON--------------- EATING ABOARD THE SPACE STATION---------:------------------------ "THE FOOD UP THERE IS PRETTY GOOD, ACTUALLY------," LU SAID.--------------- HOWEVER, WHILE THE FOOD IS TASTY, IT GETS MONOTONOUS AFTER A WHILE---------------, MUCH LIKE EATING AT YOUR FAVORITE RESTAURANT EVERY NIGHT WOULD BE.--------------------- "FOR US, IT'------S 3 MONTHS BEFORE WE GET TO EAT SOMEWHERE--------------- ELSE.------" THAT'------S WHY THE CREW LOOKS FORWARD TO THE ARRIVAL--------------- OF THE PROGRESS CARGO SHIP--CARRYING SUPPLIES FROM EARTH.------ "IT--------------- IS A WELCOME THING, BECAUSE IT BRINGS FRESH FOOD.------" ANOTHER--------------- WELCOME DELIVERY OF THE PROGRESS IS-ODORS.------ "SPACE STATION--------------- HAS NO SMELL WHATSOEVER------," LU SAID, EXPLAINING THAT, BECAUSE--------------- OF THE AIR CIRCULATION-SYSTEM, WHEN YOU OPEN A-CAN OF FOOD, YOU--------------- CAN SMELL IT-ONLY FOR SECONDS BEFORE THE ODOR IS CIRCULATED AWAY.--------------- WHEN THE PROGRESS DOCKED, HOWEVER, THE ASTRONAUTS COULD SMELL FOOD--------------- INSIDE.------ "WHEN YOU OPENED THE VALVE UP, BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY--------------- OPEN THE HATCH, YOU COULD SMELL APPLES IN THE SPACE STATION---------------------," HE SAID.------ "WE WERE LOOKING AT OUR WATCHES (UNTIL IT WAS TIME--------------- TO OPEN THE HATCH). THOSE THINGS TASTED TERRIFIC.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" ON--------------- PLAYING THE PIANO UPSIDE DOWN IN MICROGRAVITY---------:------------------ YOU CAN'------T DO IT. WHEN YOU'------RE UPSIDE DOWN------, "EVERYTHING'------S--------------- REVERSED------," LU EXPLAINED.------ "IF YOU EVER TRY IT, IT'------S--------------- NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" ON--------------- THE VIEW FROM THE SPACE STATION---------:------------------------ "WITH BINOCULARS, YOU CAN SEE AIRPLANES IN FLIGHT---------------------," HE SAID.------ "YOU CAN SEE INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS. I EVEN HAVE A--------------- PICTURE OF MY HOME. YOU CAN ALSO SEE LOTS OF CRATERS ON------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE------ MOON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH.------" LU SHOWED US A PICTURE HE TOOK FROM--------------- THE SPACE STATION WHICH SHOWED THE MOON AND MARS NEXT TO EACH OTHER--------------- IN A SINGLE FRAME.------ "THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PICTURES FROM--------------- THE MISSION, BECAUSE IT SHOWS WHERE WE'------RE GOING.------" MARS---------------, WHICH WAS CLOSER TO EARTH THAN IT HAD BEEN IN 60,000 YEARS WHEN--------------- LU WAS ON THE STATION, PUT ON QUITE A SHOW FOR THE CREW. ORDINARILY---------------, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE CELESTIAL OBJECTS FROM THE STATION WHILE--------------- THE LIGHTS ARE ON, SINCE THE CREW'------S EYES ARE ADJUSTED FOR--------------- THE BRIGHTER CONDITIONS.------ "MARS WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH LAST SUMMER--------------- THAT IT WAS ALWAYS OUT THE WINDOW------," HE SAID, EXPLAINING THAT--------------- IT WAS VISIBLE EVEN WITH THE LIGHTS ON.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ON--------------- BEING ON A TWO-PERSON CREW WITH MALENCHENKO---------:------------------------ "I LEARNED TO LIKE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, RUSSIAN RAP MUSIC---------------------," HE SAID.------ "WE GOT ALONG GREAT. WE NEVER HAD A SINGLE ARGUMENT.--------------- WE THINK A LOT A LIKE.------" HE SAID THAT HE AND MALENCHENKO WERE--------------- FORTUNATE THAT THEY HAD SIMILAR PHILOSOPHIES ABOUT THE MISSION---------------, AND THAT THEY EACH WORKED TO BE A GOOD CREWMATE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BIOGRAPHICAL--------------- DATA----------------------------------- HOMETOWN---------: HONOLULU, HAWAII, AND WEBSTER, NEW YORK-------------------------- BORN---------: JULY 1,-------------------------- 1963 EDUCATION---------: GRADUATED FROM R.L.
