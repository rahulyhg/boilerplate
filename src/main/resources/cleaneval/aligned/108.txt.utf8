----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE REPUBLIC-----------------------------------------------------------  POLICIES FOR POLITICAL-,ELECTORAL---- & CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM--------------------------------------------------------------  ISSUED 5TH APRIL-,2000, ADOPTED-BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL, JANUARY---------------- 2000  [*NOTE: THE FIRST SECTION OF PART B, CLAUSE 2B,C IS-STILL IN OFFICIAL-DRAFT MODE, AND IS SUBJECT TO FURTHER-DISCUSSION AT THE JUNE 2000 CONFERENCE---------------------------------------------------------------]  PREAMBLE:-------------------------------------------------  A-------------THE PLP PROCEEDS FROM THE-PREMISE THAT MAJOR POLITICAL, ELECTORAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL-REFORMS ARE LONG-OVERDUE IN AUSTRALIA-AND THAT THEY ARE NOT AND WILL NOT BE TACKLED BY THE MAJOR-PARTIES. IN DEVELOPING A BLUEPRINT FOR CHANGE WE PRIORITISE AN ORDER IN THE-CHANGE PROCESS ON THE BASIS OF URGENCY AND ACHIEVABILITY. THEREFORE, WHAT-FOLLOWS IS AN AMBIT PACKAGE--EG. PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION FOR ALL PARLIAMENTS-IS HIGH ON THE LIST, FOLLOWED BY THE ABOLITION OF STATE UPPER HOUSES, FOLLOWED-BY-THE CREATION OF A TWO-TIER STRUCTURE OF ELECTED GOVERNMENT. DEPENDING ON THE-CHANGING PREFERENCES OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE SOME STAGES MAY BE SPEEDED UP-,COLLAPSED OR SKIPPED ALTOGETHER. WHAT WE PRESENT HERE IS AN OVERALL CONCEPT FOR-CHANGE.-----------------------------------------  B/ OUR PRINCIPAL POLICIES FOR A NEW-REPUBLIC ARE:--------------------------  PRESIDENT: ELECTED DIRECTLY BY THE PEOPLE, WITH SYMBOLIC POWERS ONLY:------ NOTE: THE IRISH PRESIDENTIAL MODEL PROVIDES A USEFUL GUIDE: STRICTLY---- SYMBOLIC POWERS UNLIKE THE PRESENT POWERS OF EITHER THE MONARCH OR---- AUSTRALIAN GOVERNOR-GENERAL. IN ADDITION, PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF---- ANY PARLIAMENT DURING THE PAST 10 YEARS CANNOT BE CANDIDATES. STEPS WOULD BE---- ENFORCED TO PREVENT EXPENDITURE BY PARTIES OR BUSINESS INTERESTS OF LARGE---- SUMS OF MONEY TO DISTORT THE RESULT OF THE POLL.-----  A PRESIDENT IS NEEDED TO PERFORM A VARIETY OF CEREMONIAL AND LEGISLATIVE---- FUNCTIONS.-----  TWO-TIER SYSTEM OF ELECTED GOVERNMENT:------- NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND A---- MUCH STRENGTHENED LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM, COUPLED WITH ADMINISTRATIVE LOCAL---- GOVERNMENT REGIONS-----  PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION: AIMED TO CREATE GREATER DIVERSITY IN---- PARLIAMENT-----  IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF POLITICAL EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT, WITH---- CONSIDERATION OF A NUMBER OF OPTIONS FOR DEMOCRATISATION AND BROADENING OF---- CABINET GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA.-----  FIXED FOUR-YEAR PARLIAMENTARY TERMS-----  A COMPREHENSIVE BILL OF RIGHTS-----  SAFEGUARDS FOR:----------------------------------- (A)----------- THE---- ENVIRONMENT;----------------------------------------- (B)------------------ INDIGENOUS---- PEOPLES' RIGHTS;----------------------------------- (C)----------- OTHER---- MINORITY GROUPS---------------------------------------------------  C------------------/ PLP POLICY IS-AIMED AT CREATING THE MAXIMALIST REPUBLIC, A-REPUBLIC FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE-PEOPLE AND OF THE PEOPLE - AS IT SHOULD BE! A MERE CHANGE OF CEREMONIAL HEAD OF-STATE WOULD STILL LEAVE AUSTRALIA WITH A RIGID AND ARCHAIC CONSTITUTION,-AN-OUTMODED POLITICAL SYSTEM AND A GROSSLY UNEQUAL SOCIETY. THIS WOULD BE PIECEMEAL-TINKERING OF THE WORST KIND. THE TIME HAS COME TO CONSIDER CLEAR ALTERNATIVES TO-THE FEDERAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT, THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM, THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND-THE SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT. A BILL OF RIGHTS, CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION OF THE-ENVIRONMENT AND A CONCILIATORY SETTLEMENT OF INDIGENOUS RIGHTS NEED TO BE-INCORPORATED IN A REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTION.-------------------------------------  D-----------/ THE PLP HAS ADOPTED THE-POSITION THAT A SOVEREIGN PEOPLE NATURALLY HAVE THE UNFETTERED RIGHT TO REWRITE-AND REPLACE THEIR CONSTITUTION IF THEY BELIEVE THIS TO BE A REQUIREMENT FOR-THEIR SURVIVAL, PROSPERITY AND IMPROVEMENT OF-THEIR DEMOCRACY. THE-PLP HOLDS-THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN AUSTRALIA IN RECENT YEARS IS LIKE PUTTING THE CART-BEFORE THE HORSE.------  NEITHER MAJOR PARTY HAS A PROGRAM FOR SIGNIFICANT CONSTITUTIONAL AND-POLITICAL CHANGE.-----------------------------------------------  E------------------/ THE NOTION THAT-A GOVERNMENT CAN BE ENTERPRISING - AND ENABLING - ITSELF IS THE ANTITHESIS OF-THE VIEW THAT ONLY PRIVATE ENTERPRISE CAN DELIVER ECONOMIC RECOVERY, JOBS AND-FUTURE PROSPERITY FOR AUSTRALIA. MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, EVEN THOSE WITH A-SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE SECTOR, HAVE ENTIRELY GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR JOINTLY-OWNED-PUBLIC CORPORATIONS TO RUN KEY INDUSTRIES, E.G. FRANCE AND NORWAY. AS THE PLP IS-OF THE VIEW THAT AUSTRALIA SHOULD AIM AT GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISE RATHER THAN-PRIVATISATION IT BECOMES IMPERATIVE TO BUILD REAL-QUALITY AND INDEPENDENCE INTO-THE GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENTS AND TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENTS-CEASE TO BE THE SERVANTS OF POWERFUL MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND FINANCIERS-IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.-----------------------------------------  THE REFORMIST STRATEGY IS DEALT WITH IN-THREE SECTIONS:-----------------  SECTION 1: THE INADEQUACIES OF THE EXISTING POLITICAL SYSTEM;------  SECTION 2: A MAXIMALIST MODEL FOR POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN-AUSTRALIA;------  SECTION 3: DRAFTING THE NEW CONSTITUTION, - CONSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY-, -LAUNCHING THE NEW CONSTITUTION BY MEANS OF SECTION----------------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 1 THE-INADEQUACIES OF THE EXISTING POLITICAL SYSTEM-------------------------------------------------  A-----------/ THE KIND OF QUESTION WHICH-AUSTRALIANS ARE NOW INCREASINGLY INCREASINGLY ASKING THEMSELVES IN RELATION TO-THE REPUBLIC IS: WHAT KIND OF A REPUBLIC DO WE REALLY WANT? IF AUSTRALIANS CAN-RECONSTRUCT THEIR POLITICAL SYSTEM TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF A SOCIETY VASTLY-DIFFERENT FROM FEDERATION IN 1900, HAVING GREATLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AT ITS-DISPOSAL AND POSSESSING SUPERIOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AS WELL AS-PHYSICAL RESOURCES, HOW WILL THEY DO IT? WOULD THERE STILL BE ANY NEED FOR A-FEDERAL SYSTEM AT ALL? OR WOULD IT BE A HUGE HINDRANCE TO EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT?-WOULD THERE STILL BE NEED A FOR SOME 830 POLITICIANS? SHOULD THEY INTRODUCE A-TWO-TIERED SYSTEM OF ELECTED GOVERNMENT AND ENABLE THE MAJORITY PARTY OR-COALITION TO SELECT THE MINISTRY FROM OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT RATHER THAN APPOINT-CAREER POLITICIANS? SURELY THE ISSUE IS NO LONGER WHETHER AUSTRALIA SHOULD BE A-REPUBLIC OR CONTINUE TO BE AN OUTPOST OF A RATHER SHAKY CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY-WHICH HAS LITTLE INTEREST IN HER DISTANT DOMINION. IMPROVING THE PROCESSES OF-GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA, STEEPED IN 200 YEARS BRITISH COLONIAL AND WESTMINSTER-TRADITIONS, IS A TASK HABITUALLY AVOIDED BY BOTH MAJOR PARTIES. UNLESS IT'S DONE-AUSTRALIA MAY NO LONGER IN BUSINESS ON ACCOUNT OF ITS ANTIQUATED CONSTITUTION-AND POLITICAL SYSTEM. MORE LIKELY IT WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS-OF FOREIGN MULTI NATIONAL ENTERPRISES THROUGH A COMPRADOR CLASS OF WELL-PAID-COMPLIANT AUSTRALIAN MANAGERS AND POLITICIANS. THAT TREND IS UNMISTAKABLE-ALREADY. THE PLP INTENDS TO CREATE A REAL DEMOCRACY IN AUSTRALIA.-----------------------------------------  B-----------/ THE DOMINATION BY TWO MAJOR-PARTIES HAS LED TO AN EROSION OF DEMOCRACY AND TO A WEAKENING OF GOVERNMENT-,OFTEN DESCRIBED AS----- "THE PASSING OF PARLIAMENT-----". THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM-HAS KEPT THAT NOW STERILE, MALE DOMINATED, TWO-PARTY SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR FAR TOO-LONG. A GREATER VARIETY OF INTERESTS, PERSONS AND CULTURES SHOULD BE REPRESENTED-IN THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT. THE ROLE OF THE CITIZENS IN CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE-HAS BEEN MINIMAL AND TOKENISTIC. THE INITIATIVE AND TIMING OF REFERENDUMS IS THE-PREROGATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY. ALMOST EVERY CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM-TURNS INTO A POLITICAL SLANGING MATCH REGARDLESS OF THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSAL(S).-ONLY EIGHT OF MANY SUCH REFERENDUMS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL OVER THE 100 YEARS OF-FEDERATION. THE REJECTION OF THE FOUR PROPOSALS OF THE 1988 REFERENDUM-DEMONSTRATED THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION'S DANGEROUS INFLEXIBILITY ONCE AGAIN.-UPDATING THE CONSTITUTION HAS PROVEN TO BE FAR TOO DIFFICULT. THE RESULT HAS-BEEN TO DEVISE EXPENSIVE WAYS TO CIRCUMVENT IT, OFTEN UNSUCCESSFULLY, A RECIPE-FOR STAGNATION AND DETERIORATION.-----------------------------------------------  C------------------/ THE PLP'S-ANSWER TO THESE PROBLEMS IS THAT THE PIECEMEAL TINKERING MUST END. AUSTRALIANS-NEED TO REWRITE THE ENTIRE CONSTITUTION. THE IDEA THAT THE CONSTITUTION CANNOT-BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER ONE, SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY BE AMENDED (AND THEN-ONLY IN TERMS OF THE HIGHLY UNSATISFACTORY AMENDING CLAUSE, SECTION 128), IS NO-MORE THAN A LEGAL FICTION. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM ULTIMATELY RULES-AUSTRALIA RATHER THAN THE PEOPLE. THIS LINE OF ARGUMENT, FREQUENTLY VOICED BY-SO-CALLED CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERTS, SUGGESTS THAT TODAY'S AUSTRALIANS ARE SHACKLED-BY PAST AGREEMENTS AMONG SOME OF THE CITIZENS WHO VOTED ON THE 1900 CONSTITUTION-DRAFT IN A VOLUNTARY REFERENDUM 100 YEARS AGO.-----------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 2: A MAXIMALIST-MODEL FOR POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN AUSTRALIA-------------------------------------------------  2A-----------/ THE PHONEY MINIMALIST-REPUBLIC 'DEBATE' RESULTED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF FEBRUARY, 1998.-THE CONVENTION WAS DOMINATED BY CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS, MINIMALIST CANDIDATES-OF THE ARM AND THE PRO-MONARCHIST CANDIDATES. HOWEVER, A VOCAL MINORITY OF-MAXIMALIST CANDIDATES PRESENTED THE KIND OF ARGUMENTS WHICH ARE EMBODIED IN PLP-POLICY AS WELL. IN ADDITION, THE AUSTRALIAN VOTERS FAVOUR A DIRECTLY ELECTED-PRESIDENT A FACT THAT THE CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY AT THE CONVENTION FOUND HARD TO-DEAL WITH. WE HAVE INCORPORATED THAT WISH ALSO IN OUR POLICY.-----------------------------------------------  2B------------------/ THAT POLICY-NOW FOLLOWS:---------------------------------------------------------------  A.--------------------------------------------------------------- HEAD-OF STATE TO BE DIRECTLY ELECTED BY THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE.---------------  HEAD OF STATE TO HAVE ESSENTIALLY SYMBOLIC POWERS, PLUS SOME RESERVE POWERS-AIMED ESSENTIALLY AT BREAKING LEGISLATIVE DEADLOCKS. IN THE EVENT OF LEGISLATIVE-DEADLOCK-THE PRESIDENT CONVENES A JOINT SITTING OF PARLIAMENT WHERE A MAJORITY-CAN RESOLVE THE MATTER, OR OTHERWISE A REFERENDUM IS CALLED.------  THE PLP DOES NOT FAVOUR THE US-STYLE PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM OR A DUAL EXECUTIVE-STRUCTURE (AS FOR INSTANCE IN FRANCE).-----------------------------------------------------------  B. THE PRIME MINISTER-WILL REMAIN THE EFFECTIVE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT.--------------  THIS OFFICIAL IS THE LEADER OF THE PARTY OR COALITION OF PARTIES WHICH-COMMAND MAJORITY SUPPORT ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES-----------------------------------------------------------  C.-- THE PLP IS MOST-CONCERNED WITH THE LACK OF QUALITY IN POLITICAL EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT.-----------------  WE PROPOSE A DEMOCRATISATION AND BROADENING OF CABINET GOVERNMENT IN-AUSTRALIA, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF---- :--------------------------  INCLUSION OF MINISTERS WITH APPROPRIATE EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE FROM---- OUTSIDE OF PARLIAMENT (AS IS THE PRACTICE IN MOST OVERSEAS COUNTRIES);-----  NOMINATION OF MINISTERS NOT ONLY BY THE PRIME MINISTER BUT ALSO BY UNIONS---- AND COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS IN THEIR SPHERE-OF RESPONSIBILITY;-----  ELECTION OF CABINET BY THE WHOLE OF PARLIAMENT, INSTEAD OF APPOINTMENT BY---- PRIME MINISTER OR FACTIONAL LEADERS;-----  DIRECT ELECTION BY VOTERS OF ALL EXECUTIVE/CABINET POSITIONS;-----  ALL MINISTERS TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO PARLIAMENT, AND SUBJECT TO RECALL AT---- ANY TIME.---------------------------------------------  MINISTERIAL CODES OF CONDUCT-------------  WE ENDORSE THE CREATION OF CODES OF CONDUCT FOR EACH MINISTERIAL DEPARTMENT-IN ORDER TO ENSHRINE A CHARACTER OF ETHICS AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES AND TO ENSURE THAT THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE UN CHARTER-AND A CONCERN FOR THE WELFARE OF ALL PEOPLE BECOMES THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS FOR-ALL POLICY MAKING.-----------------------------------------------------------  D. MEASURES TO END TO-THE DOMINATION OF THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT BY TWO PARTIES.--------------  THE PLP CALLS--- FOR A REFERENDUM TO INTRODUCE PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION-----BY MEANS OF THE HARE-CLARK SYSTEM BASED ON MULTI-MEMBER ELECTORAL DISTRICTS-(THESE DISTRICTS COULD BE SAME AS THE ADMINISTRATIVE REGIONS FOR LOCAL-GOVERNMENTS.)------  THIS WOULD PROVIDE SCOPE FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF MORE PARTIES AND-INDEPENDENTS - PROVIDED THEY WOULD HAVE MINUM SUPPORT OF, SAY, 4% OR 5% IN A-NINE-MEMBER DISTRICT. THIS WOULD ALSO END THE SINGLE-MEMBER (DISTRICT) SYSTEM-,PORK BARRELLING, BY-ELECTIONS, NEGLECTED SEATS (SAFE SEATS), ELECTORAL BOUNDARY-CHANGES AND THE ADVERSARIAL MODE OF DEBATE.------  THE PROPORTION OF VOTES REQUIRED FOR REPRESENTATION IN A DISTRICT WOULD NOT-BE ABLE TO BE RAISED WITHOUT A REFERENDUM OR SOME OTHER MEANS OF DEMOCRATIC-CONSULTATION. THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT MAJOR PARTIES IN A DISTRICT CANNOT SIMPLY-VOTE TOGETHER AND RAISE THE PERCENTAGE WITHOUT COMMUNITY CONSULTATION, IN ORDER-TO REDUCE THE REPRESENTATION OF SMALLER RIVAL PARTIES AND INDEPENDENTS.------  A SYSTEM OF 30 ELECTORAL DISTRICTS, EACH RETURNING NINE MEMBERS, WOULD YIELD-A 270 MEMBER LEGISLATURE (HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES). ADD TO THIS THREE SENATORS-PER DISTRICT (POSSIBLY NOT BELONGING TO ANY PARTY) AND A TOTAL OF 360 MPS WOULD-REPRESENT THE NATION IN CANBERRA. THAT WOULD BE LESS THAN HALF THE PRESENT TOTAL-NUMBER IF THE STATES ARE ABOLISHED. THE HARE CLARK SYSTEM IS WELL KNOWN IN-AUSTRALIA AS IT IS USED IN TASMANIA, THE ACT, AND FOR THE PRESENT SENATE-ELECTIONS. IT IS PREFERRED OVER OTHER PR SYSTEMS, SUCH AS LIST PR SYSTEMS AND-THE NZ MMD SYSTEM OF PR (BASED ON THE GERMAN SYSTEM).-----------------------------------------  THE SENATE WOULD RETAIN ITS PRESENT POWERS-AND FUNCTIONS.-----------------  THE SENATE , ALREADY ELECTED BY PR - HARE CLARKE NOW (ALTHOUGH DISTORTED-BY----- "MALAPPORTIONMENT-----" ON ACCOUNT OF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM AND STATE-REPRESENTATION) WOULD RETAIN ITS PRESENT POWERS AND FUNCTIONS. HOWEVER, IN THE-PLP PROPOSAL SENATORS WOULD NOT REPRESENT THE ABOLISHED STATES. THE PRINCIPAL-FUNCTIONS OF THE SENATE WOULD BE LEGISLATIVE REVIEW AND HOLDING PARLIAMENTARY-INQUIRIES AS AT PRESENT. THE PLP WOULD REMOVE THE POWER OF BLOCKING SUPPLY .------  THE PLP FAVOURS THE ROBSON ROTATION SYSTEM FOR PR (USED IN THE ACT, AND-TASMANIA) WITH THE RIGHT TO DISCONTINUE THE ALLOCATION OF PREFERENCES BEYOND THE-NUMBER OF VACANT POSITIONS. THE PLP SUPPORTS VOTER-DETERMINED ABOVE-THE-LINE OR-UNDER-THE-LINE OPTIONAL PREFERENCE VOTING. COMPULSORY VOTING WILL BE RETAINED.-----------------------------------------------------------  E. THE INTRODUCTION OF A-FIXED FOUR-YEAR TERMS FOR THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT AND GOVERNMENT-------------- -  WITH PROVISION FOR OPTIONAL EARLY ELECTIONS ONLY IF A GOVERNMENT HAS LOST-MAJORITY SUPPORT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND AFTER EXHAUSTING ALL-OPTIONS OF FORMING A NEW GOVERNMENT UNDER THE EXISTING PARLIAMENT.------  FIXED-TERM PARLIAMENTS ARE SUPPORTED BY MANY PEOPLE BUT THE MAJOR PARTIES-WON'T TAKE STEPS TO INTRODUCE THIS REFORM ONCE IN POWER. THE ADVANTAGES ARE-WIDELY ACCEPTED THOUGH. IT PROVIDES TIME TO IMPLEMENT POLICY AND PREDICTABILITY.-IT REDUCES UNCERTAINTY AND THE FREQUENCY OF ELECTIONS.-------------------------------------------CHANGE THE ELECTORAL-LAW OR WRITE IT INTO-THE NEW CONSTITUTION.----------------------------------------------------------------------  F. THE CREATION OF A-TWO-TIER------- SYSTEM OF ELECTED GOVERNMENT WITH STRONG LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS.--------------  THE PRESENT STATES COULD BE REPLACED BY SMALLER, ADMINISTRATIVE REGIONS-INDIRECTLY ELECTED BY GROUPS OF LOCAL COUNCILS AND/OR ON SOME BIOREGIONAL-PRINCIPLE. SPECIAL SEPARATE CITY ADMINISTRATIONS COULD BE ESTABLISHED MODELLED-PERHAPS ON THE GREATER BRISBANE COUNCIL---.---------------------------------------------- THIS WOULD REDUCE DIRECT POPULAR-ELECTIONS TO TWO LEVELS: THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS.-----------------  THE REGIONS COULD BE GRAFTED ONTO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TIER. ALREADY AN-EXTENSIVE SYSTEM OF VOLUNTARY REGIONAL COUNCILS EXISTS WHICH COULD BE A BASE TO-START FROM. THE SAVINGS OF SUCH MEASURES HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE IN THE ORDER-OF MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS (POSSIBLY $30 BILLION P.A., DRUMMOND IN HALL-, 1998)DEPENDING ON WHAT MODEL OF REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION IS ADOPTED. E.G. DRUMMOND HAS-DEVELOPED DETAILED SCENARIOS OF SUCH OPTIONS BY MEANS OF COST/BENEFIT ANALYSES-BASED ON APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR REGRESSION TECHNIQUES TO STATE, TERRITORY AND-LOCAL GOVERNMENT OUTLAY AS WELL AS POPULATION DATA.------  THE NEED FOR SPECIAL REGIONS TO ENSURE REPRESENTATION FOR SPARSELY POPULATED-OUTLYING AREAS IS ACKNOWLEDGED AND WILL BE ACCOMMODATED.-----------------------------------------  EXISTING POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF-THE STATES WOULD BE REDISTRIBUTED BETWEEN NATIONAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNING-BODIES.-----------------  THE PLP GREATLY FAVOURS THE STRENGTHENING OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, BOTH IN-TERMS OF FUNDING AND FUNCTIONS. IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY EXTEND FUNCTIONS-CRITICAL MASS NEEDS TO BE ACHIEVED AND SOME SMALLER LOCAL-GOVERNMENT UNITS WOULD-NEED TO BE AMALGAMATED. CERTAIN FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE NOW THE DOMAIN OF STATE-GOVERNMENTS WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF SUFFICIENT SIZE AND-CAPACITY TO HANDLE THEM. IN ADDITION, THE PLP WILL INTRODUCE THE PRECINCT (OR-WARD) SYSTEM TO ENSURE MAXIMUM COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT - AND-GENERALLY PROMOTE GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE.------  IN 1900 AN EXCELLENT CASE COULD BE MADE FOR A FEDERAL STRUCTURE. A LOT HAS-CHANGED SINCE THEN.-COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT SYSTEMS HAVE IMPROVED-DRAMATICALLY. IN 2000 A COUNTRY OF ONLY 19 MILLION PEOPLE DOES NOT NEED A-FEDERAL STRUCTURE, SEVEN DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS PLUS THAT OF THE NORTHERN-TERRITORY AND ACT. ALL THE REASONS FOR FEDERATION HAVE-LONG DISAPPEARED---------AS A FIRST STEP THE PLP ADVOCATES THE ABOLITION OF THE STATE UPPER HOUSES BY-MEANS OF STATE REFERENDUMS - ASSUMING THAT OUR PRIORITY NO. 1,-THE INTRODUCTION-OF PR FOR STATE LOWER HOUSES, HAS FIRST BEEN ACHIEVED. THIS WOULD THEN BE-FOLLOWED BY A CAMPAIGN TO ABOLISH THE STATES ALTOGETHER.-----------------------------------------------------------  G. THE INTRODUCTION OF A-BILL OF RIGHTS, INCLUDING A PREAMBLE CONCERNING THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE-AND PROVIDING A CONCILIATORY SETTLEMENT WITH SIMILAR STATUS AND PROTECTION AS A-BILL OF RIGHTS.--------------  THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND SPECIAL MINORITIES WILL ALSO BE INCLUDED-IN A BILL OF RIGHTS.-----------------------------------------------------------  H. THE INTRODUCTION OF-NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AIMS AND SAFEGUARDS--------------  TOGETHER WITH WAYS OF REDRESS AND COMPENSATION WHERE A COMMUNITY S OR-INDUSTRY'S LIVELIHOOD IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED.-----------------------------------------------------------  I. THE AMENDMENT-PROCEDURE FOR THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL BE SIMPLE.--------------  THE NEW CONSTITUTION-CAN BE AMENDED IN TWO WAYS:------  ONE: BY A 3/4 MAJORITY OF ALL NATIONAL PARLIAMENTARIANS OF BOTH HOUSES OF-PARLIAMENT VOTING JOINTLY------  OR BY A BINDING, MANDATORY NATIONAL REFERENDUM WHICH CAN BE INTRODUCED IN TWO-WAYS:--------------  INITIATED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY-----  INITIATED BY THE PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF A PETITION SIGNED BY 1% OF THE---- ELECTORS ON THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL ROLL--------------------------------------------------------------------J.-REVIEW OF CONSTITUTION PROCEDURE---------  THE NEW CONSTITUTION NEEDS TO BE EXTENSIVELY-REVIEWED AFTER EVERY-FIVE YEARS.-THE REVIEW NEED TO BE-GIVEN WIDE PUBLICITY AND ADJUSTMENT FACILITATED.-----------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 3: DRAFTING THE-NEW CONSTITUTION, - CONSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY, - LAUNCHING THE NEW CONSTITUTION-BY MEANS OF SECTION------------------------------------------------------------------- 128  K. WHO WOULD DRAFT THE-NEW CONSTITUTION?--------------  THE PLP-RECOMMENDS A PANEL OF 50 PERSONS REPRESENTING VARIOUS KEY-CONSTITUENCIES OF ALL AGE GROUPS AND ALL CLASSES IN SOCIETY. THESE SHOULD BE IN-A POSITION TO CONSULT EXTENSIVELY WITH THEIR CONSTITUENCIES . POLITICIANS SHOULD-NUMBER NO MORE THAN FIVE AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERTS WOULD BE EQUALLY LIMITED TO-FIVE. THERE COULD BE FIVE FOREIGN CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERTS TO PROVIDE INPUT.-----------------------------------------------------------  L. CONTINUITY--------------  IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE CONSTITUTION HAS A LINK WITH THE OLD ONE AND-PROVIDES CONTINUITY IN SPITE OF INTRODUCING RADICAL CHANGES.-MANY NEW-CONSTITUTIONS OF NATIONAL STATES HAVE BEEN-THE OUTCOME OF GREAT-POLITICAL AND/OR-SOCIAL UPHEAVALS, MAJOR CRISES SUCH AS WARS, A STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE, CIVIL-UNREST AND SECESSION. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT STATES WHICH ARE NOT-SUBJECT TO SUCH MAJOR CRISES (A) THEREFORE HAVE NO NEED FOR MAJOR-CHANGES TO THE-GROUND-RULES OF THEIR GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM;-(B) THAT SUCH CHANGES AS ARE NEEDED-CANNOT BE ACHIEVED IN A CIVIL, DEMOCRATIC AND PEACEFUL MANNER. AFTER ALL MAJOR-CRISES ARE ALMOST-ALWAYS THE RESULT OF-INADEQUATE, EVOLUTIONARY ADJUSTMENT.------  MOREOVER, THE NOTION THAT AUSTRALIA IS FREE FROM CRISIS AT PRESENT WOULD BE-CHALLENGED BY MANY AND DENIED ONLY BY THE ULTRA CONSERVATIVE AND FOOLHARDY. IT-HAS BECOME A VERY UNEQUAL COUNTRY IN RECENT DECADES WITH MANY PRESSING SOCIAL-ISSUES. IN ECONOMIC TERMS AUSTRALIA IS STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE-AND ACHIEVE GREATER COMPETITIVENESS. INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL IS INCREASINGLY-DICTATING HER DESTINY. AUSTRALIA'S PRESENT CONSTITUTION AND POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS-SEVERE CONSTRAINTS WHICH, THE PLP MAINTAINS, CANNOT BE REMEDIED BY INEFFECTUAL-PIECEMEAL TINKERING AT THE MARGINS.-----------------------------------------------------------  M. LAUNCHING THE NEW-CONSTITUTION THROUGH SECTION 128 - AN EVOLUTIONARY METHOD--------------  THE PRINCIPAL PROBLEM IN HAVING A CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM ACCEPTED HAS BEEN-THE REQUIREMENT LAID DOWN IN SECTION 128 THAT , APART FROM A NATIONAL MAJORITY-,THERE HAS TO BE----- "MAJORITY IN A MAJORITY OF STATES-----". CLEARLY THIS-REPRESENTS A BIAS IN FAVOUR OF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM ITSELF. IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE-THIS PROBLEM, AN UNDEMOCRATIC FEATURE OF THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION THE CAUSE OF-MUCH RIGIDITY AND EXPENSE, THE FOLLOWING STRATEGY IS RECOMMENDED:------  IN A----- "NEW CONSTITUTION REFERENDUM-----" THERE COULD BE TWO QUESTIONS IN-ORDER TO OVERCOME THE----- "MAJORITY OF STATES-----" PROBLEM, AS FOLLOWS:--------------  FOR THE PURPOSE OF VOTING ON THIS NEW CONSTITUTION PACKAGE ARE YOU IN---- FAVOUR OF DISREGARDING A REQUIREMENT OF SECTION 128 THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL---- REFERENDUM NEEDS TO BE CARRIED BY A MAJORITY OF STATES? YES/NO-----  DO YOU SUPPORT THE PROPOSITION THAT THE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL PACKAGE SHOULD---- REPLACE THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION IN ITS ENTIRETY? YES/NO--------------------------------------
