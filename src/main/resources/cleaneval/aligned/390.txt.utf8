HIS BRAIN DAMAGE WAS THE CAUSE OF A------BULLET FRAGMENT SHOT-INTO HIS BRAIN DURING WAR. FROM THEN ON Z----- SUFFERED IMPAIRMENT OF-VISION, LOSS OF MEMORY AND ABILITY TO SPEAK,----- READ AND WRITE. THE BOOK `THE MAN WITH THE SHATTERED WORLD' DESCRIBES----- HOW THIS COURAGEOUS MAN RELEARNS TO IDENTIFY, RECALL AND UNDERSTAND THE------WAY TO SPEAK, READ AND WRITE.-------- FIRSTLY- Z'S ABILITY TO SEE WAS ALMOST-COMPLETELY RUINED. HIS VISION----- WORKED IN VERY MYSTERIOUS WAYS. HE COULD NO LONGER SEE A WHOLE SINGLE----- OBJECT. INSTEAD, HIS EYES SAW THE LEFT SIDE OF OBJECTS; THE RIGHT SIDE----- OF THINGS DIDN'T SEEM-TO EXIST. FOR INSTANCE WHEN HE PICKED UP A SPOON----- HE COULD ONLY SEE PART OF-IT. HIS VISION WAS NOT THE SAME AS YOURS OR----- MINE; IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. TO HIM THE THINGS-OTHERS WOULD SEE----- WOULD JUST BE A SWARM OF FUZZINESS. A PICTURE APPEARED TO BE UPSIDE----- DOWN, INSIDE OUT, LOP SIDED-AND ANY OTHER WAY IT-COULD BE DISTORTED.----- IF THINGS DID SEEM TO BE FUZZY, WHAT HE DID SEE WAS ONLY HALF AS MUCH----- AS SOMEONE ELSE WOULD SEE; HE HAD A SMALL SPAN OF VISION.-------- NOT ONLY WERE REAL SITUATIONS MUFFLED BY HIS VISION BUT SO WERE------IMAGINARY SITUATIONS. Z SUFFERED HALLUCINATIONS BECAUSE THE DAMAGED----- AREA OF THE BRAIN STIMULATED THE NERVE CELLS THAT RETAIN VISUAL----- MEMORIES. IT WAS AS THOUGH THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS BODY DIDN'T EXIST.----------- HE COULDN'T SEE IT SO EVERY TIME HE WALKED ALONG HE BUMPED INTO WALLS----- AS A RESULT. VISION WAS JUST ONE OF THE MANY-DIFFICULTIES Z SUFFERED.-------- DUE TO THE BRAIN DAMAGE HIS `SENSE OF BODY' CHANGED AS WELL AS HIS----- REACTIONS. IN FACT, HE HAD-NO SENSE OF HIS BODY-INCLUDING OTHER OBJECTS----- AROUND HIM. HE LOSES THE SIGHT OF HIS RIGHT SIDE BECAUSE HE FORGETS HE----- CAN'T SEE THAT SIDE; THIS IS BECAUSE OF T AT OTHER TIMES Z WAS UNAWARE----- OF THE POSITIONING OF HIS BODY'S PARTS.----------- IF HE CLOSED HIS EYES HE WASN'T QUITE SURE WHERE HIS RIGHT LEG WAS.----------- HE HAD TO SEARCH FOR PARTS OF HIS BODY LIKE SEPARATE PIECES.----- SURPRISINGLY IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO SHOW HIS DOCTOR WHERE HIS BACK----- WAS. IN ADDITION HE'D FORGOTTEN A LOT OF THE NAMES FOR PARTS OF HIS----- BODY; IT WOULD TAKE HIM LITERALLY HOURS TO REMEMBER. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE----- FOR Z TO POINT OUT SOMETHING QUICKLY BECAUSE HE GOT ALL CONFUSED. FOR----- EXAMPLE IF THE DOCTOR SAID `HANDS ON YOUR HIPS', HE WOULD BE LEFT ALL----- BEWILDERED.-------- ANOTHER MISFORTUNE WAS FORGETTING HOW HIS BODY FUNCTIONED LIKE GOING TO----- THE TOILET AND FORGETTING HOW TO GET SOMEONE'S ATTENTION. THE TIME----- WHEN HE NEEDED THE TOILET IN HOSPITAL WAS FRUSTRATING FOR Z BECAUSE----- HE'D FORGOTTEN HOW TO GET THE NURSE'S ATTENTION. THE PHYSICAL STRAINS----- WERE JUST TOO MUCH FOR HIM AS HE GOT TIRED VERY EASILY AND QUICKLY.-------- SENSE OF SPACE WAS ANOTHER DIFFICULTY Z FACED. GENERALLY, HE HAD NO----- SENSE OF IT AND COULDN'T JUDGE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THINGS. HE----- PERCEIVED THE WORLD AS BROKEN INTO THOUSANDS OF SEPARATE PARTS.----- MISJUDGING THE POSITION OF OBJECTS WAS ONE OF HIS FAULTS. FOR EXAMPLE----- IF HE WANTED TO SIT DOWN HE WOULD MISJUDGE WHEREABOUTS THE CHAIR WAS----- AND WHERE HE WAS. THE SAME DIFFICULTY OCCURRED-WITH CLASPING HANDS;----- HE COULDN'T USE HIS RIGHT HAND BECAUSE-HE COULDN'T SEE IT. THIS SEEMED----- TO-BE A SITUATION OF `OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND'.-------- DIFFICULTIES SUCH AS THESE RAN INTO THOSE USING OBJECTS. Z FORGOT HOW----- TO USE SIMPLE THINGS. IF HE WAS GIVEN A NEEDLE AND THREAD IN HOSPITAL----- WORKSHOPS HE WOULD JUST SIT THERE FOR AGES TO WORKOUT HOW TO USE THEM.----- THEY LOOKED FAMILIAR BUT HE JUST FORGOT HOW TO USE THEM. MORE----- MISJUDGMENTS OF THE POSITION OF OBJECTS LEAD TO PROBLEMS. FOR EXAMPLE----- WHEN HE WENT TO AXE A STUMP OF-WOOD HE WOULD JUST HIT THE FLOOR OR HIS----- FOOT INSTEAD. THINGS SEEMED SO PECULIAR TO HIM THAT HE WAS AFRAID TO----- REACH-OUT AND TOUCH THINGS-IN HIS ROOM.----------- HE LIVED IN A-WORLD THAT SEEMED TO-HAVE DISINTEGRATED; THE SIMPLEST----- THINGS BECAME SO COMPLEX. Z HAD TO SEARCH FOR EVERYTHING AS LURIA----- DESCRIBES,'HE MENTALLY PROBED EACH OBJECT AS THOUGH HE WERE A BLINDFOLDED----- MAN GROPING HIS WAY THROUGH SPACE'. IT WAS JUST ONE BIG MAZE FOR HIM----- BECAUSE BECAUSE HE COULDN'T ORIENT HIMSELF IN SPACE, TELL FROM LEFT OR----- RIGHT OR GAUGE DISTANCE AND RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 2 OBJECTS. Z COULDN'T----- EVEN WORKOUT WHERE A SOUND WAS COMING FROM BECAUSE HE'D LOST SPATIAL----- ORIENTATION.-------- HIS ABILITY TO READ-ALSO SUFFERED GREAT PROBLEMS. IT WOULD TAKE HIM----- HOURS TO READ SOMETHING LET ALONE UNDERSTAND IT. ONCE, HIS FAMILY----- BOUGHT A NEW STOVE; HE SPENT WEEKS TRYING TO READ AND UNDERSTAND THE----- INSTRUCTION BOOKLET THAT EVENTUALLY HE WAS CONVINCED THE STOVE WAS----- FAULTY. HIS CONCENTRATION TO READ WAS TOO-HARD SO HE AVOIDED IT WHEN----- HE COULD. GENERALLY, HE COULDN'T-READ; HE WAS ILLITERATE AND COULDN'T----- REMEMBER THE ALPHABET. HOWEVER, HE ATTEMPTED TO RELEARN THIS SKILL.----- BY THE THIRD LESSON HE COULD REMEMBER THE LETTERS M AND A BUT NOT----- IMMEDIATELY; HE PROGRESSED VERY SLOWLY. HE ESPECIALLY FOUND IT VERY----- DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER THE LETTERS S- K AND M. SO, HE TRIED TO----- ASSOCIATE WORDS WITH THEM-BUT HE COULD ONLY REMEMBER THESE FOR A COUPLE----- OF MINUTES. FOR HIM TO REMEMBER WORDS, HE FOUND IT GOOD TO RECITE THE----- OUT LOUD. B READING WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR Z. IT WASN'T UNTIL A FEW----- MONTHS THAT HE KNEW THE WHOLE ALPHABET; EVEN STILL HE COULDN'T RECALL----- IT IMMEDIATELY. HIS VISUAL SPAN WAS LIMITED SO HIS READING SUFFERED----- SUBSEQUENTLY. Z COULDN'T SEE AN ENTIRE WORD, HE HAD TO READ EACH----- LETTER. IN ORDER TO READ HE WOULD HAVE TO FOCUS A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT----- AND ABOVE A LETTER TO SEE IT. HE COULD ONLY READ THREE LETTERS AT----- A TIME. READING WAS SO SLOW FOR HIM ; WHEN HE GOT TO THE THIRD WORD OF----- A SENTENCE HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE WORDS BEFORE SO HE'D START AGAIN. AS A----- RESULT- HE READ REALLY SLOWLY AND BECAME VERY IRRITATED PLUS THE FACT----- THAT HE COULDN'T READ OUT OF HIS RIGHT EYE.-------- READING WAS JUST PART OF Z'S PROBLEM WITH LETTERS AND WORDS. TO FIND----- OUT HE COULD NO LONGER WRITE WAS ALSO DEVASTATING SEEING-AS HE USED----- THIS ALL THE TIME IN HIS STUDIES. FOR ONE THE SIMPLE TASK OF ACTUALLY----- HOLDING A PENCIL WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. HE-LITERALLY FORGOTTEN HOW TO------DO THIS AND WRITE LETTERS. EVEN-IF HE DID MANAGE TO WRITE SOMETHING HE----- WASN'T IN ANY FIT STATE TO READ WHAT HE'D WRITTEN.----------- THE PROGRESS OF HIS WRITING-WAS THE SAME AS HIS PROGRESS TO READ, THAT----- BEING SLOW. IT TOOK HIM SIX MONTHS TO READ AND WRITE WITH INTENSIVE----- PRACTICE. Z MISSED OUT A LOT OF THE IMPORTANT DETAILS OUT WHEN HE----- WROTE. PUNCTUATION WASN'T-PRESENT IN HIS WRITING AS HE'D FORGOTTEN ANY----- KIN OF RULE. GRAMMAR WAS-ANOTHER IMPOSSIBLE OBSTACLE TO GET OVER. THE----- INJURY HIS BRAIN WAS LEFT-WITH WAS COULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO-OPERATE WITH----- LANGUAGE. TOO COMPLEX SYNTACTICAL PATTERNS ARE FAR TOO DIFFICULT FOR A----- PATIENT TO GRASP-WHO CAN'T EVEN GRASP-THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF WORDS----- AND WORKOUT WHAT THEY IMPLY. FOR INSTANCE, Z MAY UNDERSTAND WHAT----- `BROTHER' AND `FATHER' MEAN BUT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT----- `BROTHER'S FATHER' MEANT. HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO UNDERSTAND VERY SHORT----- SENTENCES.-------- WRITING WAS SUCH A LONG PAINFUL PROCESS. HE SPENT TWENTY FIVE YEARS----- WRITING HIS JOURNAL. IT WOULD LITERALLY TAKE ONE DAY TO WRITE HALF OR----- ONE FULL PAGE. THIS WAS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE.-HE----- DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO LINK ONE SENTENCE WITH ANOTHER AND SO CONSEQUENTLY----- WROTE DISJOINTED PHRASES AND CLAUSES. HIS LACK OF MEMORY AFFECTED HIS----- ABILITY TO WRITE. IT WOULD TAKE HIM AGES TO TO REMEMBER WORDS; EVERY----- WORD WAS ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE. THE SUBJECT HE WAS ACTUALLY WRITING----- ABOUT ALSO SLIPPED FROM HIS MEMORY. AS A RESULT HE OFTEN REPEATED WHAT----- HE'D WRITTEN BECAUSE HE'D FORGOTTEN HE'D ALREADY WRITTEN IT. SOON, HE----- NO LONGER HAD THE STRENGTH, MEMORY, THOUGHTS OR IDEAS TO CARRY ON----- WRITING HIS LIFE STORY. IN FACT, WRITING TOOK LONGER AND LONGER TOWARDS----- THE END OF HIS JOURNAL.-------- ALL OF THESE DIFFICULTIES Z SUFFERED FROM WERE DUE TO MAJOR LOSS OF----- MEMORY. IN THE BEGINNING, JUST AFTER BEING WOUNDED, HE COULDN'T EVEN----- REMEMBER HIS OWN NAME AND THE VILLAGE THAT HE LIVED IN.-NAMES WOULD BE----- LINGERING IN HIS MIND READY TO BE SPOKEN, ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE.----- IF HE ACTUALLY TRIED TO TO REMEMBER-THINGS HE WOULD FIND-IT EXTREMELY----- DIFFICULT TO FIND THE RIGHT WORDS. BUT WHEN HE DIDN'T HAPPEN TO BE----- THINKING OF IT HE SUDDENLY FOUND WORDS COMING TO HIM. FOR EXAMPLE,----- FAMILIAR TUNES WOULD SUDDENLY APPEAR IN HIS HEAD. EVEN SO, HIS MEMORY----- WAS STILL VERY BAD. IT WAS ALSO SHATTERED INTO SMALL PIECES LIKE THE----- REST OF HIS WORLD.-------- AS Z'S MEMORY WAS SO BAD, THIS PREVENTED HIM FROM EVER STUDYING----- ANYTHING HE'D ONCE LEARNT AS A STUDENT. HIS MEMORY EVEN AFFECTED HIM----- IN EVERY DAY SITUATIONS. IT WAS A CONSTANT STRAIN FOR HIM TO THINK AND----- REMEMBER THE WORDS PEOPLE SPOKE AND ANSWER BACK AT THE SAME TIME. HE----- WAS CONSTANTLY FORGETTING. EVERY DAY SIMPLE CHORES WOULD BE DELAYED AS----- A RESULT OF HIS MEMORY. FOR INSTANCE, HE WOULD GO TO THE BARN FOR SOME----- COAL AND FORGET THE KEY; BUT AS SOON AS HE WENT BACK FOR IT HE'D FORGET----- WHY HE WAS THERE. HIS MAIN TROUBLE WAS AMNESIA AND FORGETFULNESS.-------- EVEN THOUGH HIS MEMORY WAS SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED THERE WERE SOME THINGS HE----- COULD REMEMBER MORE THAN OTHERS.-HE FOUND IT FAR EASIER TO REMEMBER----- THINGS FROM FAR BACK IN THE PAST LIKE HIS KINDERGARTEN BUILDING. THE----- FUNNY THING WAS HE HAD TROUBLE REMEMBERING THE RECENT PAST. AS HE----- STATED ,'MY MEMORIES CAME BACK FROM THE WRONG END'. INSTEAD OF RECENT----- SITUATIONS BEING EASILY REMEMBER Z COULD RECOLLECT CHILDHOOD MEMORIES----- WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION. WHEREAS SIMPLE COMMON MEMORIES SUCH AS----- REMEMBERING WHAT A CAT OR DOG LOOKED LIKE WAS VERY HARD FOR Z. HE----- COULDN'T EVEN VISUALISE FACES FROM HIS OWN FAMILY BUT HE IMMEDIATELY----- RECOGNISED THEM.-------- GENERALLY, Z'S PREVIOUS EFFORT TO ACQUIRE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE HAD BEEN----- POINTLESS. EVERYTHING HE'D LEARNT AT SCHOOL HAD GONE. LANGUAGES HE'D----- LEARNT AT SCHOOL LIKE GERMAN-AND ENGLISH HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN. AS WELL----- AS USING FOREIGN LANGUAGES HIS USE OF ARITHMETIC HAD ALSO GONE.----- UNFORTUNATELY, Z HAD FORGOTTEN HOW TO COUNT. HE WAS UNABLE TO COUNT----- BACK CHANGE GIVEN TO HIM IN A SHOP. ALL THOSE EVERYDAY THINGS THAT YOU----- OR I FIND SIMPLE, HE FINDS COMPLEX. HE HAS TO LOOK LIFE VERY SIMPLY IN----- A WAY THAT A YOUNG CHILD WOULD.-------- EVEN THOUGH Z HAS TRIED FOR YEARS TO IMPROVE HIMSELF, IN REALITY HIS----- WOUND HAS CAUSED MAJOR BRAIN DAMAGE. DAMAGED AREAS OF THE CEREBRAL----- CORTEX COULD NOT BE RESTORED. IMPROVEMENTS HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN MADE----- ALTHOUGH HE HAS ADJUSTED TO HIS BODY PECULIARITIES BUT THEY STILL ANNOY----- HIM IF HE'S SUFFERING AN ATTACK. HOWEVER, PROBLEMS WITH `SPACE'----- CONTINUED-FOR YEARS. HE WAS UNABLE TO ORIENT HIMSELF IN HIS OWN HOME------SETTLEMENT.-------- WHEN IT CAME TO READING AND WRITING, HE DID ACTUALLY TEACH HIMSELF HOW -----TO DO THESE SKILLS AGAIN. HOWEVER, IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME. AS YOU----- KNOW IT TOOK HIM 25-YEARS TO WRITE HIS JOURNAL AT ONE PAGE A DAY AT THE----- MOST. THE CONTENT OF HIS WRITING DIDN'T REALLY IMPROVE AS HIS EFFORT -----TO EXPRESS HIMSELF BECAME NO SIMPLER. ALTHOUGH, HIS SPEAKING IMPROVED.----- BUT HIS WORLD CONTINUED TO BE ALIEN AND FRAGMENTED. NOTHING ALTERED----- HIS TRAGIC STATE OF MEMORY. SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT Z NEVER REALLY----- OVERCAME HIS TROUBLE OF MEMORY. INSTEAD HE JUST CONSTANTLY TRIED TO----- IMPROVE THINGS. IN REALITY HE WAS FACED WITH-A VICIOUS CIRCLE OF LIFE----- WHICH HAD NO REAL END.-------- BIBLIOGRAPHY `THE MAN WITH A SHATTERED WORLD' BY A.R LURIA-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
