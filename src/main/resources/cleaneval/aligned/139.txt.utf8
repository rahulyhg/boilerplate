WE-HAVE ALWAYS USED DETERGENT WITH NO PERFUMES-OR DYES, SO THAT WAS NEVER AN-ISSUE. I-UNDERSTAND THAT USING FABRIC SOFTENER ON CLOTH DIAPERS AND DIAPER-WRAPS MAKES THEM LESS ABSORBENT.-LAUREL-----  WHAT WORKED WELL FOR US WAS WASHING ONCE WITH A DYE-FREE-,PERFUME-FREE DETERGENT, THEN RUNNING THE CLOTHES THROUGH-THE FULL WASH CYCLE AGAIN WITH NO DETERGENT.---- WE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH BABY'S SKIN.- I THINK THE EXTRA-RINSE IS IMPORTANT, AS-I'VE OFTEN NOTICED SUDS ON THE-CLOTHES IF I OPEN THE WASHER RIGHT AFTER THE REGULAR-CYCLE IS DONE.- THE SOAP ISN'T THOROUGHLY RINSED OUT OF-THE CLOTHES IN THE REGULAR CYCLE (AT LEAST WITH MY-WASHER).-CECILIA-----  I DID WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY SUGGESTED - DYE-FREE, PERFUME-FREE DETERGENT- WITH AN EXTRA RINSE - WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS A BABY AND IT SEEMED TO WORK- FINE.- ALTHOUGH I HAD PURCHASED IVORY, I-FOUND OUT LATER THAT YOU CAN'T- USE IT ON SLEEPWEAR FOR BABY/CHILDREN SINCE IT IS A SOAP AND WILL REMOVE- THE FLAME RETARDANTS.-----AS FOR SOFTENERS/DRYER SHEETS---I NEVER USED THEM BECAUSE THE FRAGRANCE- JUST SEEMED TO CHEMICALLY TO ME.- I DIDN'T WANT THAT NEXT TO THE BABY.-CATHY------  WE DON'T USE FABRIC SOFTENERS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. BUT WE FOUND THAT-OUR DAUGHTER'S SKIN RESPONDED BEST TO THE DYE- AND PERFUME-FREE MAINSTREAM-DETERGENT (ALL OR ARM & HAMMER, ETC.). EVERYTHING ELSE, INCLUDING ALL THE-EXPENSIVE GUILT-MARKETED BABY STUFF, GAVE HER A RASH.- LAURA-----  LAUNDRY SOAP FOR BABIES: FOR MY OWN AND MY DAUGHTER'S CLOTHES, I USE PLAIN-OLD UNSCENTED TRADER JOE'S LAUNDRY DETERGENT. IT'S CHEAP AND CONCENTRATED-SO A BOX OR BOTTLE (COMES IN POWDER OR LIQUID) LASTS A LONG TIME. I'M-ALLERGIC TO ALMOST ALL SCENTS IN BRAND-NAME-PRODUCTS, AND THE SMELL OF-TALCUM POWDER LITERALLY-MAKES ME GAG AND GIVES ME A HEADACHE, SO I AVOID-MOST "BABY" PRODUCTS. THE CLOTHES COME OUT SMELLING AND LOOKING FINE TO ME,-AND WHEN TIME AND WEATHER PERMIT, I DRY THEM ON THE LINE OUTSIDE RATHER-THAN IN THE DRYER, AND THEN THEY SMELL SUPER, THOUGH THEY MIGHT NOT BE AS SOFT.-NICOLE-----  I NEVER DID MY BABY'S LAUNDRY SEPARATELY, BUT I'VE ALWAYS USED DYE-FREE-,PERFUME-FREE DETERGENT FOR MY OWN SENSITIVE SKIN.- IT SEEMS TO WORK JUST-FINE, AND I HAVEN'T EVER DONE A SECOND RINSE.-DAWN--------WE HAVE USED TIDE FREE WITH FOR OUR CHILD'S CLOTHES-SINCE SHE WAS BORN.-(SHE IS NOW ALMOST 20 MONTHS OLD). WE WASH ALL OF THE FAMILY'S CLOTHES-TOGETHER, AND HAVE NOT HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS METHOD. GOOD LUCK, GAIL-GAIL-----  I DO A SEPARATE LOAD OF-BABY CLOTHES, SHEETS--TOWELS, ETC. EVERY WEEK-,ALL-COLORS AND FABRICS TOGETHER, WITH DREFT AND WARM WATER, AND IT HAS-WORKED OUT FINE.- MY SON DOES NOT HAVE PROBLEMS WITH HIS SKIN, SO I-PROBABLY COULD USE SCENT- AND DYE-FREE TIDE OR THE LIKE, BUT HAVE NOT AS-YET.- SUCH PRODUCTS ARE VERY HARSH, HOWEVER, SO I WOULD WANT TO DO AT-LEAST ONE *WARM--RINSE.- THE OTHER DETERGENT WE HAVE USED, BOTH FOR-OURSELVES AND THE KID, IS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY LIQUID LAUNDRY-PRODUCT, ECOVER, THAT WE GET AT WHOLE FOODS OR THE BERKELEY BOWL.- IT-COMES IN SEVERAL SIZES, INCLUDING A BIGGISH PLASTIC BOTTLE, AND IS FINE-FOR BABY CLOTHES.- IT IS NOT A PARTICULARLY "BUDGET" PRODUCT, HOWEVER.-I PREFER TO DO THE KID'S WASH SEPARATELY, SO THAT I CAN BETTER CONTROL-WHAT HE'S EXPOSED TO, AND IT'S NOT A PROBLEM TO COLLECT ONE LOAD OVER-THE COURSE OF 4-7 DAYS.- AS TO DRYER SHEETS AND FABRIC SOFTENERS - I-THINK THOSE ARE A BIG-WASTE OF MONEY AND THAT YOU'D BE BETTER SERVED-BUYING THE MILDER SOAP OR DETERGENT.- HAVE FUN.- WENDY-----  MANY BABIES ARE SENSETIVE TO THE PERFUME AND DYES IN DETERGENTS.-BELIEVE IT OR NOT, DREFT HAS FRAGRANCE AND EVEN THOUGH SOME BABIES ARE-OK WITH THAT, OUR PEDIATRIC DERMETOLOGIST RECOMMENDED ALL FREE AND-CLEAR AS A BETTER OPTION.- ABSOUTELY NO FABRIC SOFTNER OR DRYER SHEET.-EVEN ADULTS SHOULD REALLY NOT USE THEM IF THEY HAVE ANY SENSETIVITIES.-I WAS-ALLERGIC TO THEM THOUGH I DID NOT FIND THAT OUT-TILL THIS YEAR.-SUDDENLY ALL MY ALLERGIES DISAPPERED WHEN I STOPPED USING THEM.-DOWNEY MAKES A "DOWNEY FREE" BUT WHY BOTHER??- IF YOU WANT TO TALK-SOME MORE, EMAIL ME.-GLOSSON-----  ABOUT WASHING BABY CLOTHES:- I'VE BEEN WASHING ALL OF MY DAUGHTER'S- (9 1/2MOS) CLOTHES WITH REGULAR DETERGENT (TIDE, USUALLY) SINCE SHE WAS BORN.- I-DID ONE LOAD AFTER SHE-GOT HOME WITH TIDE AND TRIED THE CLOTHES ON HER-,KEEPING-AN EYE OUT FOR REACTIONS, AND HAD NO PROBLEM.- THIS HAS WORKED FOR-PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE OTHER MOMS THAT I KNOW.- I'D SAY GIVE IT A SHOT-BEFORE GOING OUT AND INVESTING IN ALL THE SPECIAL DETERGENTS.- AT LEAST-THAT WAY, IF YOU DO HAVE TO USE THEM, YOU'LL KNOW IT'S BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT-YOUR BABY NEEDS.- GOOD LUCK-!JOCELYN-----  REGARDING DETERGENT AND BABY CLOTHES.-NOT ALL BABIES HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.- I HAVE ALWAYS WASHED BOTH MY KIDS-CLOTHES WITH OUR CLOTHES AND WITH OUR REGULAR DETERGENT, ARM AND HAMMER-SCENT FREE, AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM.- WE DON'T USE ANY FABRIC-SOFTENERS THOUGH.- BUT SOME OF MY FRIENDS BABIES SKIN ARE MORE SENSITIVE-,AND THEY USE SPECIAL DETERGENT.- HOPEFULLY YOU WON'T HAVE TO.-LIZ-------  I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WASHING MY BABY'S CLOTHES WITH PERFUME-FREE, DYE-FREE-DETERGENTS; ALL, TIDE, AND ARM AND HAMMER ALL WORK, WITHOUT EVEN AN EXTRA-RINSE CYCLE. (I DON'T USE MUCH SOAP, SINCE IT'S NOT AS TOUGH THE CLOTHES-HAVE GROUND-IN DIRT OR ANYTHING.) SHE'S FIVE MONTHS OLD NOW, AND WE'VE BEEN-DOING THIS SINCE SHE WAS BORNWITH NO SIGN OF ANY ALLERGIC REACTION. YOUR-BABY'S SKIN MAY BE MORE PRONE TO IRRITATION, BUT OTHERWISE I SEE NO REASON-TO SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY-ON DREFT ETC.-COULDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT FABRIC SOFTENERS AND DRYER SHEETS, THOUGH, 'CAUSE I-DON'T USE EITHER.-JENNIFER-----  ONE MORE POINT ABOUT FABRIC SOFTENERS THAT WASN'T MADE BY RESPONDERS SO-FAR--THE ALLERGY DOCTOR AT KAISER WHO TREATS MY TODDLER FOR EXCEMA POINTED-THAT IF I CHOOSE TO USE A FABRIC SOFTENER, IT SHOULD BE THE KIND I PUT IN-THE WASHING MACHINE, NOT THE SHEETS ONE ADDS TO THE CLOTHES IN THE DRYER-,WHICH WORK BY COATING THE CLOTHES (WITH A WAX, I THINK) AND IS DEFINITELY-GOING TO CONTACT THE SKIN, EVEN IF IT IS SCENT-FREE.- THE FABRIC SOFTENER IN-THE WASHER IS LESS LIKELY TO BE RIGHT ON THE SURFACE OF THE CLOTH IN CONTACT-WITH SKIN--IT EITHER PENETRATES INTO THE FIBERS OR IS RINSED OUT OR-BOTH--CAN'T REMEMBER THAT PART OF THE EXPLANATION.-SALLY------  WE WERE BOTH GRAD STUDENTS WHEN OUR SON (ALMOST 3) WAS BORN, AND WE-DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO SEPARATE LAUNDRY, SO I DECIDED TO USE THE-ALL FREE (PERFUME-FREE, DYE-FREE (UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALSO EXPENSE-FREE!)) SOAP AND IT WORKED GREAT.---- BE SURE TO WASH ALL NEW CLOTHES BEFORE THE BABY WEARS THEM TOO.-I WAS HAPPY THAT THIS WORKED SINCE SEVERAL PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY-HAVE SEVERE SKIN ALLERGIES, SO I WAS ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR ANY-ADVERSE REACTION.-HEATHER-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
