ONE AREA THAT IS OF PERENNIAL INTEREST IS HOW TO BEST CONFIGURE THE GRADES IN LOCAL SCHOOLS. PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES PROVIDES FOR KINDERGARTEN THROUGH GRADE 12 IN A VARIETY OF GRADE ARRANGEMENTS, FROM THE K-12 SCHOOL TO SEPARATE SCHOOLS FOR SINGLE GRADES. UNFORTUNATELY, AS PAGLIN AND FAGER (1997) POINT OUT:----- "RESEARCH HAS NOT PROVIDED DEFINITIVE ANSWERS TO THE MYRIAD POSSIBLE QUESTIONS ABOUT GRADE SPAN, BUT THE QUESTIONS HAVE NEVER GONE AWAY. THEY ARE QUESTIONS WHICH ARISE WHENEVER SCHOOL REFORM, INCREASING OR DECLINING ENROLLMENT, OR FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS BRING ABOUT A REORGANIZATION OF EXISTING SCHOOLS, THE BUILDING OF NEW SCHOOLS, OR CONSOLIDATION OF DISTRICTS-----" (P. 2). MUCH OF THE RESEARCH AVAILABLE HAS BEEN DONE ON RURAL OR MIDDLE SCHOOLS. THE RESEARCH ON THE----- "BEST-----" GRADE CONFIGURATION IS INCONCLUSIVE. AT BEST, IT INDICATES FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DECIDING ON A SCHOOL'S GRADE SPAN OR A COMMUNITY'S CONFIGURATION OF GRADES WITHIN ITS ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL SYSTEM.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONTENTS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW DO SCHOOLS DIFFER IN GRADE CONFIGURATION?------------------------------------------------------- SINGLE-GRADE-LEVEL CONFIGURATIONS-------------------------------------------- OTHER GRADE-LEVEL CONFIGURATIONS: MIDDLE SCHOOLS, K---------------------------------------------12 HOW DO GRADE CONFIGURATIONS AFFECT TRANSITIONS?-------------------------------------------- WHAT FACTORS DO SCHOOL DISTRICTS CONSIDER WHEN DECIDING ON GRADE CONFIGURATION?------------------------------------------- REFERENCES--------------------------------------------- WEB RESOURCES---------------------------------------------- ERIC RESOURCES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW--------------- DO SCHOOLS DIFFER IN GRADE CONFIGURATION?-------------------- SCHOOLS IN--------------- THE UNITED STATES ARE ORGANIZED IN DIFFERENT WAYS: SOME SCHOOLS--------------- INCLUDE K-3, K-4, K-5, K-6, K-8, K-9, OR K-12; OTHERS ARE ORGANIZED--------------- AS MIDDLE SCHOOLS, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS, AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS;--------------- AND STILL OTHERS CONSIST OF STUDENTS IN JUST ONE GRADE, SUCH AS--------------- A KINDERGARTEN CENTER OR A NINTH-GRADE CENTER. SOME SCHOOLS INCLUDE--------------- PRE-KINDERGARTEN. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S NATIONAL CENTER--------------- FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS (2002) PROVIDES DATA ON THE NUMBER OF REGULAR--------------- PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROVIDING INSTRUCTION AND THE PERCENTAGE--------------- OF STUDENTS IN MEMBERSHIP, BY GRADE SPAN AND BY STATE, FOR THE SCHOOL--------------- YEAR------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2000-SINGLE-GRADE-LEVEL--------------- CONFIGURATIONS------------------------ THE LITERATURE--------------- SUGGESTS THAT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE FOUND ADVANTAGES TO SCHOOLS--------------- THAT CONTAIN STUDENTS AT ONE GRADE LEVEL, ALTHOUGH THESE ADVANTAGES--------------- ARE NOT NECESSARILY SUPPORTED BY-RESEARCH (REENTS, 2002):--------------------------------------- A SINGLE-GRADE----------------- CENTER, SUCH AS A SCHOOL ONLY FOR NINTH-GRADERS, CAN DEVELOP PROGRAMS----------------- SPECIFIC TO THE NEEDS OF THAT AGE GROUP.----------------------- SIPHONING----------------- OFF STUDENTS FROM SEVERAL SCHOOLS CAN RELIEVE OVERCROWDING AT----------------- THOSE SCHOOLS.------------------------ STUDENTS----------------- MAY BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE ON AN EQUAL LEVEL IN MORE ACTIVITIES----------------- AND BE LESS INFLUENCED BY OLDER STUDENTS.----------------------- THE GREATER----------------- NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN SINGLE-GRADE CENTERS MAY ENABLE THE SCHOOL----------------- TO INCREASE COURSE OFFERINGS.-------------------------------------- THE LITERATURE--------------- ALSO SUGGESTS SOME POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES TO SEPARATE-SINGLE-GRADE--------------- CONFIGURATIONS (HOPKINS, 1997):--------------------------------------- THE COST----------------- AND LENGTH OF STUDENT TRAVEL INCREASES, PARTICULARLY IN A SCHOOL----------------- DISTRICT THAT COVERS A LARGE AREA.------------------------ PARENT INVOLVEMENT----------------- MAY DECREASE, POSSIBLY AFFECTED BY THE DISTANCE TO THE SCHOOL----------------- AND THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS A FAMILY'S CHILDREN ATTEND.----------------------- STUDENTS----------------- ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN INCREASED NUMBER OF SCHOOL TRANSITIONS.----------------------- FEWER OPPORTUNITIES----------------- ARE PROVIDED FOR INTERACTION BETWEEN AGE GROUPS.-------------------------------------- HOPKINS--------------- (1997) ALSO SUGGESTS SOME ADDITIONAL FACTORS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CONSIDER:--------------------------------------- COMBINING----------------- SCHOOLS INTO SEPARATE GRADE CENTERS MAY AFFECT WHETHER NEIGHBORHOOD----------------- SCHOOLS CLOSE OR REMAIN OPEN.----------------------- CURRENT----------------- BUILDINGS MAY HAVE A DESIGN MORE SUITABLE FOR SEVERAL GRADE LEVELS.----------------------- SCHOOL POPULATION----------------- MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE SUBSTANTIALLY AS CONFIGURATIONS CHANGE.-------------------------------------------------------------- OTHER--------------- GRADE-LEVEL CONFIGURATIONS: MIDDLE SCHOOLS, K------------------------------12 "MUCH--------------- OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH REGARDS TO SCHOOL GRADE STRUCTURE CAN--------------- BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MIDDLE SCHOOL-----" (FRANKLIN------------------- & GLASCOCK, 1996, P. 4). THE SEPARATION OF STUDENTS IN GRADES--------------- 5 OR 6 TO 7 OR 8 IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS IS JUSTIFIED BY SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS--------------- BECAUSE DISTRICTS BELIEVE THAT MIDDLE SCHOOLS BETTER MEET THE DEVELOPMENTAL--------------- NEEDS OF PREADOLESCENTS. AS HOWLEY (2002) POINTS OUT, THE DEVELOPMENTAL--------------- NEEDS OF YOUNG ADOLESCENTS DIFFER FROM THOSE OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL--------------- CHILDREN AND OLDER TEENAGERS.----- "DEVELOPMENTALLY RESPONSIVE MIDDLE--------------- SCHOOLS MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THAT IS KNOWN ABOUT YOUNG ADOLESCENTS--------------- AND THE CULTURAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY LIVE-----" (LOUNSBURY, 1996).--------------- THE NUMBER OF MIDDLE SCHOOLS INCREASED BY 35% FROM 1967 TO---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN THE PAST--------------- DECADE, RESEARCHERS ALSO HAVE DEMONSTRATED RENEWED INTEREST IN SCHOOLS--------------- THAT INCLUDE GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH---- A STUDY OF RURAL SCHOOLS--------------- THAT EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GRADE CONFIGURATION AND STUDENT--------------- ACHIEVEMENT IN LOUISIANA FOUND THAT STUDENTS IN K-12 RURAL SCHOOLS--------------- DID AS WELL OR BETTER ON ACHIEVEMENT TESTS AS STUDENTS IN SEPARATE--------------- ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, OR HIGH SCHOOLS. STUDENTS IN HIGH POVERTY AREAS--------------- ALSO DID BETTER IN THE K-12 SCHOOLS (FRANKLIN---- & GLASCOCK, 1996).--------------- A SIMILAR STUDY IN TEXAS ANALYZED DATA FROM A STUDY OF 1001 TEXAS--------------- HIGH SCHOOLS, INCLUDING 116 K-12 SCHOOLS. THIS STUDY PRODUCED SIMILAR--------------- RESULTS (BICKEL, HOWLEY, WILLIAMS,---- & GLASCOCK, 2000).------------------------------------------- HOW--------------- DO GRADE CONFIGURATIONS AFFECT TRANSITIONS?------------------------ THE DIVISION--------------- OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS INTO CONFIGURATIONS THAT INCLUDE FEWER GRADES--------------- REQUIRES THAT STUDENTS MAKE SEVERAL TRANSITIONS FROM ONE SCHOOL--------------- TO ANOTHER. RESEARCHERS NOTE THAT TRANSITIONS CAN BE STRESSFUL FOR--------------- STUDENTS:--------------------------------------- ALSPAUGH----------------- (1999) FOUND A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT LOSS DURING EACH TRANSITION----------------- YEAR. HE ALSO FOUND THAT SOME STUDENTS REGAIN WHAT IS LOST IN----------------- THE FOLLOWING YEAR, BUT IT WOULD SEEM THAT STUDENTS WHO MAKE FEWER----------------- TRANSITIONS NEED FEWER YEARS TO MAKE UP FOR ACHIEVEMENT LOSSES----------------- CAUSED BY TRANSITIONS.------------------------ ANOTHER----------------- STUDY FOUND THAT EACH TIME STUDENTS SWITCHED SCHOOLS, THEIR FEELINGS----------------- OF ANONYMITY INCREASED. RESEARCHERS WHO FOUND THAT SIXTH-GRADE----------------- STUDENTS IN BOTH ELEMENTARY AND COMBINATION K-12 SCHOOLS OUTPERFORMED----------------- STUDENTS IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS OR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS CONSIDERED THE----------------- NUMBER OF TRANSITIONS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR. THIS STUDY CONSIDERED----------------- 8 SCHOOLS WITH 7 DIFFERENT GRADE SPANS WITH STUDENT POPULATIONS----------------- OF 82 TO----- 1,THE SCHOOLS WERE LOCATED IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL----------------- SETTINGS IN 5 NORTHWEST STATES. THE NUMBER OF GRADES IN THE SCHOOLS----------------- RANGED FROM 1 TO 11 (PAGLIN---- & FAGER, 1997).------------------------ ANOTHER----------------- RESEARCH STUDY FOUND THAT GIRLS IN EARLY ADOLESCENCE SUFFERED----------------- FROM A DROP IN SELF-ESTEEM, EXTRACURRICULAR PARTICIPATION, AND----------------- LEADERSHIP BEHAVIORS WHEN THEY MADE THE TRANSITION INTO MIDDLE----------------- SCHOOL OR JUNIOR HIGH, BUT NOT IF THEY REMAINED IN AN ELEMENTARY----------------- SCHOOL SETTING. THIS STUDY FOUND THAT THE EFFECTS OF THIS TRANSITION----------------- LINGERED THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEARS. FOR BOYS, THE STUDY FOUND----------------- SIMILAR NEGATIVE EFFECTS IN EXTRACURRICULAR PARTICIPATION AND----------------- GRADES, BUT NOT IN SELF-ESTEEM, WHEN THEY MADE THE TRANSITION----------------- INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL OR JUNIOR HIGH. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDED THAT----------------- THE RELATIVELY PROTECTED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SETTING MADE THE ENTRY----------------- INTO ADOLESCENCE LESS STRESSFUL FOR BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS. THE STUDENTS----------------- WHO HAD NOT HAD THE STRESS OF THE EARLIER TRANSITION SEEMED TO----------------- COPE BETTER WITH THE TRANSITION INTO HIGH SCHOOL THAN DID OTHER----------------- STUDENTS (SIMMONS---- & BLYTH, 1987).------------------------ FRANKLIN----------------- AND GLASCOCK (1996) FOUND THAT SIXTH-GRADE BOYS EXPERIENCED MORE----------------- SUSPENSIONS IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS OR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS THAN IN ELEMENTARY----------------- SCHOOLS, POSSIBLY RELATED-TO THE EFFECTS OF THE TRANSITION, THE----------------- SCHOOL ORGANIZATION--OR SCHOOL SIZE.

A REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON MIDDLE-LEVEL EDUCATION INDICATES--------------- THAT: (1) ALTHOUGH PRIMARILY AN ADMINISTRATIVE CONCERN DRIVEN BY--------------- ATTENDANCE BOUNDARIES, GRADE LEVEL ORGANIZATION HAD LITTLE IMPACT--------------- ON MIDDLE-LEVEL STUDENTS' ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT; AND (2) THE TERMS-------------------- "JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL-----" AND----- "MIDDLE SCHOOL-----" DO--------------- NOT DEFINE A SCHOOL'S PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, THE EFFECTIVE SCHOOLS--------------- RESEARCH HAS GIVEN RISE TO DISCRIMINANT ANALYSES OF EFFECTIVE MIDDLE--------------- SCHOOL VARIABLES AND ALLOWED RESEARCHERS TO IDENTIFY THOSE CHARACTERISTICS--------------- MOST COMMONLY FOUND WITHIN----- "EXEMPLARY-----" MIDDLE SCHOOLS.--------------- (159 REFERENCES) (KM)-------------------- DESCRIPTORS:--------------- AGE GRADE PLACEMENT; CLASSES (GROUPS OF STUDENTS); CURRICULUM ENRICHMENT;--------------- EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT; EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT; GRADE 6; GRADE--------------- 7; GRADE 8; GROUPING (INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES); INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM--------------- DIVISIONS; JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS; *MIDDLE SCHOOLS; *PREADOLESCENTS;--------------- *SCHOOL ORGANIZATION; *TRANSITIONAL PROGRAMS--------------------------------------------------------  EJ466872 EA------------------528302 TITLE: WHEN YOUR K-5 SCHOOL CHANGES TO--------------------- 3-AUTHOR(S): VANN, ALLAN S.------------------ SOURCE: PRINCIPAL, V73 N1 P20-22 SEP------------------ 1993 PUBLICATION DATE:------------------ 1993 ISSN:------------------ 0271-6062 DOCUMENT TYPE: JOURNAL ARTICLES (080); REPORTS--DESCRIPTIVE (141)------------------- DESCRIBES A--------------- DISTRICT'S REORGANIZATION OF 2 K-5 SCHOOLS INTO 1 FOR ALL K-2 GRADES--------------- AND 1 FOR ALL 3-5 GRADES FOR ECONOMIC REASONS.

BECAUSE OF THE--------------- PAUCITY OF LITERATURE ON THIS CONCEPT, THE MAJOR PART OF THE REPORT--------------- FOCUSES ON THE REORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF THE SOUTH--------------- ALLEGHENY (PENNSYLVANIA) SCHOOL DISTRICT. ALTHOUGH THE K----------------2, 3-5 STRUCTURE IS OFTEN IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT---------------, OTHER EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS CITED MAY INCLUDE BETTER CONCENTRATION--------------- ON THE EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN THE TWO--------------- AGE GROUPS, THOUGH ONE RESEARCH STUDY SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES--------------- IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT, ATTITUDE TOWARD SCHOOL, EXTRACURRICULAR--------------- PARTICIPATION, OR CAREER ASPIRATION. THE GOALS OF THE SOUTH ALLEGHENY--------------- REORGANIZATION (IN RESPONSE TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT) WERE TO EQUALIZE--------------- CLASS SIZES TO FACILITATE MULTILEVEL INSTRUCTION IN READING AND--------------- MATH, AND TO MAKE BETTER USE OF STAFF, SCHOOL BUILDINGS, AND INSTRUCTIONAL--------------- RESOURCES. EACH OF THESE OBJECTIVES IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL, ALONG--------------- WITH PERCEIVED DISADVANTAGES. AN EVALUATIVE REPORT REVEALED THAT--------------- THE NEW GRADE STRUCTURE SAVED MONEY AND RESULTED IN IMPROVED DISCIPLINE---------------, STUDENT ATTITUDES, AND STUDENT INTERACTION. FINALLY, LITERATURE--------------- ON THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS IS BRIEFLY REVIEWED, EMPHASIZING THE--------------- NEED FOR CLEAR ARTICULATION BETWEEN GRADE LEVELS.
