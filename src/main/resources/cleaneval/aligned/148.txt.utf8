CLINTON'S STAY-THE-COURSE MESSAGE HAS ERODED HER SUPPORT AMONG THE PARTY'------S PROGRESSIVES.

"BUT YOU CAN'T WIN NEW YORK STATE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE'S PRO-ISRAEL JEWISH COMMUNITY." WHILE PUNDITS CLAIM THAT DEMOCRAT CONTENDORS HISTORICALLY NEED TWO THIRDS OF THE JEWISH VOTE IN NEW YORK TO WIN A SENATE CAMPAIGN, CLINTON RECEIVED A MERE 53 PERCENT IN HER 2000 RUN AGAINST--- RICK
