OFFSPRING WAS FUN TO LISTEN WITH, HONESTLY------------, SAFE PUNK FOR EVERYBODY, BUT THEY MADE NSYNC JOKES SO THEY WERE GO ENOUGH------------ FOR ME, KORN WERE KINDA KORNY TO ME, I-M STILL WITH THE OPINION BLOODY------------ BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD HAD WITH THEM BEING KINDA UNORIGINAL AND LOST IN------------ A SOUP OF MIRRORING BANDS, BUT THE LEAD SINGER GUY WAS WEARING A KILT------------, SO BIG UPS TO THAT. KELLY WAS TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH BUSH SO WE HAD TO------------ WEASEL OURSELVES TO THE TIPPIDY FRONT OF THE STAGE, I-LL HAVE TO ADMIT------------ THAT I THOUGHT GAVIN, THE LEAD SINGER GUY, WAS CUTE IN A TOTALLY NON------------ HOMOSEXUAL WAY, AND-SO 4 PEOPLE TO THE FRONT UP WENT KELLY TO CROWD------------ SURF TO THE FRONT TO LEAVE ME ALONE WITH HER $300 ELPH CAMERA SINGIN------------ TO BUSHE-S COVER OF----- "THIS ONE GOES OUT TO THE ONE I LOVE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"  FOUND------------ MOBY WAS PLAYING AT THE AIRCRAFT HANGER RAVE AFTERWARDS, SO AFTER THE------------ SHOW, I FOUND THE VEGGIE BURGER STAND, GOT ONE WITH EVERYTHING, A BIG------------ COOKIE, A FROZEN NONFAT YOGURT AND ICKY FOOD BAR, THEN REALIZING I HAD------------ 3 MORE DAYS TO SURVIVE THE RETARDEDLY HIGH PRICES AND ONLY SEEING------------ $20 OF THE $300 I TOOK OUT IN MY WALLET, OH WELL, GUESS I-LL JUST MAKE ALOT------------ MORE PB AND J SANDWICHES....-------------  BUT MADE IT TO MOBY AND MOBY WAS AWESOME. FOR A TECHNO----- "ARTIST---------------" HE CAME OUT WITH DRUMMER, BASS PLAYER AND GUITAR AND AN ODD ASSORTMENT---------- FOR HIMSELF, ALONG WIT HTHE USUAL ELECTRONIC KEYBOARD THINGY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  MOBY---------------- WAS BLAZIN ON THE GUITAR, BANGIN ON THE DRUMS, MAKIN GOOD NOISE THAT------------ MADE ME HAPPY HAPPY. GO SEE MOBY IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE, THAT LITTLE VEGAN------------ CAN MAKE SOME GOOD TUNES. HIS LAST SONG(?) WAS JUST HIM AND THE COMPUTER------------, MAKING A LOW, HOLLOW BEAT THE PROGRESSIVELY GOT FAST AND FASTER WHILE------------ HE STOOD UP ON THE TABLE AND LOOKED ALL KROVY KROVY SCARY WITH WHITE------------ LIGHTS MIMICKING CAMPFIRE GHOST STORY SESSIONS.----------------  AFTER MOBY, MOBY FAN NEEDED TO GET HOME, BUT HOME WAS HARD TO FIND------------ AFTER ALL THAT MUSIC AND MILES TO WALK WITH LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE------------ MI WAS SUPPOSED TO GO. I LITERALLY WAS WALKING FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF------------ THROUGH THE MAZE OF TENTS, PEOPLE AND PORT O POTTIES TRYIN TO FIND THAT------------ DAMN TENT, I GAVE UP AND DECIDED TO SLEEP IN A CORNER UNDER A HUGE AMERICAN------------ FLAG A TENT CIRCLE BROUGHT, ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS THAT YOU HAVE TO STEAL------------ FROM A GOVERNMENT BUILDING, AND WAIT TILL THE MOURN. PASSING THE SAME------------ GUY IN THE CHAIR WITH THE UNSIGHTLY LOOK ON EM, THE SAME PEOPLE PLAYING------------ THE DRUMS, THE SAME 40 YEAR OLD BASTARDS TRYIN TO GET ALL THE GIRLS------------ TO SHOW EM THEIR TITTIES WAS TOO MUCH. I TURNED AROUND AND SAW IN THE------------ TREES THE CAUTION SIGNS, TURNED SLIGHTLY LEFT, SAW THE CRAPPY ORANGE------------ ADOBE, LOOKED BEYOND, AND THEIR WAS MY HOKEY TENT, I CLIMBED IN AT 4:------------00 AM AND WOODSTOCK DAY ONE ENDED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I-M------------ NOT SURE WHEN-I GOT UP, BUT IT WAS-WAY TOO EARLY. AT WHAT WAS NOW THE------------ USUAL PB AND J SANDWHICHES, THE BANANAS WERE GETTING A LITTLE TOO RIPE------------ THERE, ESPECIALLY AFTER I STEPPED ON THEM FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE. BUT ------------SUCH IS LIFE. SAW THIS MASSACHUSETTES BAND NAMED GUSTER, WHICH WAS COO------------, GOT PASSED OUT FREE CONDOMS WHICH WAS EXCELLENT AND CHECKED OUT ALL------------ THE GRASSROOTS INDEPENDENT TENTS TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SIGNED------------ A MILLION PETITIONS ON GUN VIOLENCE, ABORTION, KELLY BOUGHT THIS WEIRD------------ THING YOU FILL WITH WATER AND IT KEEPS YOU WARM FOR TEN DOLLARS, WE------------ THEN FOUND THE SAME THING FOR 3 FOR TEN DOLLARS, HEH HEH. GOT MISELF------------ TO THE ANTI RACIST ACTION TENT AND SAW ALL THE CD-S THAT THEY WERE GIVIN------------ FOR DONATIONS AND REALIZED I HAD ALL OF THEM CEPT 1, I MADE A NOTE TO------------ BUY IT AND THIS BOOK ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF PUNK, GOOD READING.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  COUNTING------------ CROWS WAS AHH... BORING (-----"THIS IS A SONG ABOUT WHEN I WAS IN MY------------ TWENTIES AND I WASN-T DOING ANYTHING-----") , LIMP BISCUIT WAS UNAPOLOGENICALLY------------ DUMB, RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE ROCKED (OF COURSE) AND-METALLICA GOT------------ SILLY AFTER THE---------- 4^ T H ENCORE. AFTER-METALLICA, I ONCE AGAIN------------ WENT BACK TO THE RAVE THIS TIME TO SEE------------------------------------------------------- NORMAN------------ COOK----, WHO I DEEMED THE DORK OF WOODSTOCK. I GOT REAL CLOSE AND SAW-------------HOW HE MIXED HIS RHYMES, CIGGARETTE IN ONE HAND, BEER IN THE OTHER--------------DOPEY BUCK TOOTHED SMILE AND HORRIBLE HAIRCUT, MAKIN THE JOCKS AND HIPPIES------------ DANCE DANCE DANCE. I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW HOW HE DOES WHAT HE DOES, IT------------ LOOKED LIKE HE HAD LIKE TWO TURN TABLES, HE'D TAKE A LIVE SAMPLE, SCREW------------ AROUND WITH IT, MAKE A TRANSITION FROM THE LAST BEAT WHILE LOOKING-AT------------ THE CROWD AND FLAILING HIS ARMS, AND UNLESH HIS NEW TUNE, IT WAS INTERESTING------------, BUT GOT KINDA BORING WHEN YOU HAVE NO ROOM TO DANCE AND PEOPLE WANTED------------ TO CROWD SURF (?).---------------  I--------------- GOT OUTTA THERE IN TIME TO SEE THE SMOKE FROM A FIRE-NEAR THE MOUNTAIN---------- BIKE COURSE LURKING TOWARDS THE AIRCRAFT HANGER RAVE SPOT AND FOUND MY---------- WAY HOME FIRST SHOT.----------------  THIRD DAY LAST DAY, TOTALLY TIRED OF MY WET SHOES, THE BATHROOMS OR------------ LACK OF THEM, THE COST OF FOOD, THE SMELL OF OTHER PEOPLES SWEAT ON------------ ME, THE AMOUNT OF CHANGE I DIDN-T HAVE, THE FACT THAT I HAD TO GO HOME------------, THE FACT THAT I DIDN-T KNOW WAT WAS UP WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  DID------------ THE LAST OF THE WANDERING OF THE STORES, KELLY FINALLY GOT A GREEN SHIRT------------ SHE DUG, I COULDN-T FIND ANYTHING FOR MY GIRL JESS, FOR THE QUARTERS------------ I FOUND IN MY WALLET, BUT I KEPT SEARCHING.--------------  SAW ELVIS.....----------------- COSTELLO, SAT DOWN TWENTY PEOPLE AWAY TO LISTEN TO JEWEL YODEL, KELLY------------ ONCE AGAIN FELL IN LOVE AT THE LEAD SINGER, THIS TIME OF CREED, AND------------ I GOT MYSELF PHYSCHED TO SEE MY FAVORITE-BAND OF THE SHOW, THE RED HOT------------ CHILI PEPPERS,---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I------------ REALLY WANTED TO BE CLOSE FOR THE PEPPERS, GOT ABOUT 9 PEOPLE AWAY FROM------------ THE FRONT, THE FEELING THAT THERE IS 250,000 PEOPLE TRYING TO GET TO------------ WHERE YOU ARE IS PRETTY CORE. I LOOKED AROUND MY-BACKSIDE TO SEE WHAT------------ THE HELL WAS STICKING OUT AND SAW A MOTHER AND HER TWO LITTLE CHILDREN------------ RIGHT-IN FRONT OF THE STAGE. THE MOTHER WAS OBVIOUSLY IN TOTAL DELUSION------------, THINKING SHE WOULD SOMEHOW MAKE IT THROUGH THE SET, SHE WAS TRYING TO------------ GET ALL THESE TALL STRONG GUYS NEAR HER FOR ADDED PROTECTION. KELLY------------ AND I NOTICED THAT WE WERE SURROUNDED BY LOTS OF TEENAGE GIRLS, WHICH------------ USUALLY MEANS THAT WE-RE IN NO FLY ZONE FOR CROWD SURFERS-AND MOSH MEN.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THIS------------ BEING NOT THE CASE AS FLEA COMES OUT STARK NAKED AND STARTS THE CHILLI-S------------ SET. WHICH ROCKED UNEQUIVETLY, I SANG WITH THEM IN ALL THERE SONGS------------, AS THE CROWD IN BACK OF ME PUSHED WITH THE FORCE OF THE TROJAN ARMY-S------------ OPPONENTS. I HAD TO HOLD ON TO KELLY, WHO HELD ON TO ANYTHING SHE COULD------------ TO SURVIVE THIS TOTAL CRUSHING FORCE OF THE FANS PERSECUTED WITH THE-------------SAME CONDITIONS AS I, BUT I DIDN-T CARE, THE SONGS WERE GOOD, THE PEPPERS------------ WERE INSIDE, ANTHONY-S HAIR WAS BLEACH AND SHORT, THE SONGS MELANCHOLY------------, FUNKY AND HONEST, THE CROWD FUCKIN CRAZY, THE SET SEEMED TO SHORT, THE------------ FIRES----------------  THE FIRES!?---------------- BEFORE THE PLANNED ENCORE BY THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, IT WAS ANNOUNCED------------ THAT THERE WAS A SMALL FIRE NEAR ONE OF THE TOWERS AND IF WE ALL COOPERATED------------ THE FIRETRUCK COULD GO IN AND TAKE IT OUT, I LOOKED-AROUND MY SHOULDER------------ AND SAW THREE NICE BLAZING DEMONS ALL SCATTER BRICK A BRACK AROUND THE------------ WHOLE PLACE. EARLIER THAT DAY THE PAX TENT, WHICH WORKED FOR LESS GUN------------ VIOLENCE IN THE USA, WAS GIVING AWAY FREE CANDLES FOR A VIGIL, I DIDN-T------------ SEE NO VIGEL, SO I THINK EVERYONE USED THEM FOR THE SONG----- "UNDER------------ THE BRIDGE-----" AND THEN LATER THESE LITTLE WAXY THINGS MADE GREAT------------ STARTERS,OOP. THE PEPPERS I GUESS WANTED TO FINISH AND THEY DID, THE------------ ONLY THING I COULD SAY THAT SUCKED WAS NO HIGHER GROUND, BUT-A NEW TRADITION------------ WAS MADE; ALL MENSTRUATING WOMEN HAD TO THROW THEIR TAMPONS ON-STAGE------------, I THINK I HEARD OF THAT ONE BEFORE--BUT PEOPLE DID IT, GREAT ANOTHER------------ THING BEING THROWN AT-ME.---------------------------------------  WALKING BACK AFTER THE LAST SET WAS INTERESTING. KELLY-S SANDLED FEET------------ WEREN-T QUITE OPERATIONAL, SO I OFFERED TO PIGGY BACK HER ALL THE WAY------------ BACK TO CAMP, MISSING THE RIOTERS, THE FIRES, THE DRUNKEN MASSES, JUST------------ THE MASSES, THE PEOPLE THROWING WHOLE TABLES AND-METAL CANS INTO THE ------------FIRE, THE LEAKING BATHROOMS AND DRINKING FOUNTAINS. THE FIRES WERE AWESOME------------, I TOTALLY DUG THE WHOLE ANARCHY FUCK EVERYTHING MENTALITY THANG, I DIDN-T------------ DIG IT WHEN I THOUGHT OF FIRES NEAR MY TENT, AND THE RIOTERS NEAR THE------------ TENT AND THE GRRR.... NOT A HAPPY NIGHT.-------------  FINALLY GOT ALL SET TO COLLAPSE IN MY STINKY SLEEPING-BAG WITH KELLY----------, GOT INTO THAT NICE HAPPY FLOATY FEELING AND THEN I HEAR.---------------------  "OH MY GOD, GET OUT GET OUT--------------------!",-  I LOOK UP TO SEE ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE FLYING AWAY FROM MY TENT. I HONESTLY------------ THOUGHT THE TENT NEXT TO ME CAUGHT ON FIRE, WHICH WASN-T MUCH OF A LEAP------------ OF FAITH SINCE THEY KEPT ME UP WITH THEIR DRUNKEN/HIGH/WASTED PHILOSOPHY------------ ABOUT LIFE AND BREAKFAST CEREALS, THIS GUY-S LAUGH WAS UNBEARABLE, HYENA------------ LIKE, UNCONTROLLABLE CRAP.----------------  BUT LO, MY FEAR/HOPES FADED JUST A BIT AS I SAW IT WAS A BUNCH OF DARN------------ HOOLIGANS THAT STOLE ONE-OF THE SOUPED UP GOLF CARTS TO TAKE A RIDE------------, HE RODE-OVER ONE TENT, WHICH-WAS VACANT I THINK AND GOT THE FUG OUTTA------------ THERE WITH A WINTER ASS SHADE ON HIS FACE JUST MOWING THROW-EVERYTHING.------------------------  YELLS OF,----- "I-HEARD THIS IS HAS BEEN DEEMED-A NATIONAL DISASTER,-----------THE FUCKIN NATIONAL GAURD IS COMING,-THEIR CLOSING US OFF, WE-RE UNDER---------- MARTIAL LAW------------------------------!!!"  BUT I WAS TIRED, I PUT-ON MY CONTACTS JUST SO THE NEXT TIME I GET AWAKEN---------- BY SCREAMS OF TRIPPING-OUT GIRLS OR A TANK ROLLS BY, I COULD AT LEAST---------- SEE MYSELF DIE. I NEEDED TO GET TO WORK ON MONDAY, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO---------- BE MY LAST DAY, I COULDN-T MISS THAT.--------------  3 HOURS OF SLEEP IS ALL YOU NEED.---------------  I LOOKED OVER TO THE TENT NEXT TO ME THAT WAS GIVING ME HELL. DESERTED.------------ NO ONE THERE. JUST A BOX OF CEREAL SAMPLES, THE COLLAPSED TENT, TRASH------------, (SHIT THAT STUFF WAS-EVERYWHERE) AND A PRIZE FOR ME. THREE BEAT UP BEAD------------ NECKLACES. TWO PURPLE, ONE GREEN, SHOWING THE-HELLBENT WEEK IN THEIR------------ CONDITION, AND FREE FOR ME, PERFECT. I PLAN ON TELLING AN EXTRAPOLATED------------ VERSION OF THAT ITTY BIT AND GIVE HER THE BEADS, MAYBE FOR A GOODBYE------------ GIFT, MAYBE JUST TO END A NIGHT OF TALKING AND HOLDING EACH OTHER. WE-LL------------ SEE...---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  3 FRAPACHINOS LATER A LARGE (I MEAN LARGE) HAZELNUT COFFEE AND 2 HOURS----------- INTO DRIVING BACK TO CT, I WAS FILLED WITH ASTONISHMENT OF THE SHOW----------- I WENT TO THE PEOPLE I SAW, THE GOOD TIMES, THE FUCKIN BATHROOMS, THE----------- MESSED UP SHOWERS, THE BANDS THE BANDS. A NEW FRIEND TO MISS WHEN I----------- MOVE, COULDN-T BELEIVE I DIDN-T SEE ANYONE I KNEW. GOT TO WORK A HALF----------- HOUR LATE, HIGH ON ADRENALINE AND CAFFEINE, NO ONE EVEN ASKED WHAT THAT----------- GREEN BAND AROUND MY NECK WAS OR THOSE 3 SETS OF BEADS AROUND MY NECK.----------- WENT HOME.. TRIED TO COLLAPSE, WENT OUT AGAIN SKATEBOARDING. WHICH IN----------- THE STATE OF MY KNEES, LEGS FEET AND MINDSET SHOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE-----------, BUT THOSE KICKFLIPS KEPT COMING OUT. I FOUND MYSELF SCREAMING AT ANYONE----------- I SAW, BEING TOTALLY RASH AND FILLED WITH THE FUCKED UP MENTALITY THAT----------- THE SHOW GAVE ME. IT HASN-T CALMED DOWN, I HOPE IT DOESN-T. LIFE-S TOO----------- SHORT TO PLAY IT SAFE, I-M GLAD I BLEW OFF ALL THOSE IMPORTANT THINGS-----------, SPEND ALL MY COLLEGE MONEY, WENT WITH SOMEONE I BARELY KNEW AND HAD----------- ALOT OF FUN. SUMMERS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME, I-VE BEEN LIVING THIS SONG----------- MARK TOLD ME ABOUT, I-VE BEEN DOING SO MANY CRAZY THINGS THIS SUMMER-----------, I THOUGHT THE WORST WAS GETTING INTO A RELATIONSHIP WITH A GIRL I JUST----------- MET AND HAVE TO LEAVE IN TWO WEEKS, BUT THIS SHOW IS QUITE A CLOSE SECOND.----------- I KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOIN TO BLOW OFF THE SHOW AS WHAT IT EALLY WAS, CORPORATE----------- SPONSORED GREED, MEDIA DRIVEN HYPE, SPRING BREAK IN THE SUMMERTIME-----------, BUT SCREW THAT, IT WAS FUN, IT WAS SCARY, ITS SOMETHING I-M GLAD I WAS----------- APART OF AND SOMETHING NOW THAT I HAVE TO GET THE VDEO FOR JUST TO SEE -----------MYSELF AGAIN.---------------------------------------  GOOD THINGS:--------------------------------  NO FIGHTS---------------  I DON-T THINK I SAW ONE PERSON GET THERE ASS KICKED. MY THEORY FOR THIS------------ IS SIMPLE. I COULD HAVE BEAT THE SHIT OUTTA SOMEONE DURING A SHOW THAT------------ TICKED ME OFF, BUT ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE WOULD DO THE SAME THING TO ME.------------ KINDA A NUCLEAR WAR, NO WINNERS SCENARIO, KEPT THE BALANCE BECAUSE OF------------ FEAR OF THE OUTCOME. EITHER THAT OR EVERYONE WAS TOO TIRED TO FIGHT------------ OR DIDN-T WANT TO GET ALL STINKY AFTER TAKING THAT ONE SHOWER FOR THE------------ WEEK.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CANADIAN------------ PRIDE--------------------------  I DIDN'T CHECK A MAP OR ANYTHING, SO I'M NOT SURE HOW FAR FROM CANADA------------ I WAS, BUT EVERYONE FROM CANADA SHOWED IT BY WEARING THE RED AND WHITE------------ MAPLE LEAF FLAG ON EM, PATCHES, T-SHIRTS, WHATEVER, IT WAS REALLY COOL------------ MAYBE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE THOUGHT OF AS AMERICAN WHILE GOIN TO WOODSTOCK------------, MAYBE THEIR GOVERNMENT HAS BRAINWASHED THEIR LITTLE MINDS, MAYBE I SHOULD------------ BE SO PROUD OF MY COUNTRY (HA!) BUT THATS NOT GONNA HAPPEN ANYTIME TOO------------ SOON LOTS OF STUFF TO FIX.. CANADA ACTUALLY LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. VIVE------------ CANADA OR HOWEVER YOU SAY IT IN FRANCHE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  KELLY--------------------------  KELLY IS COOL, WE-RE BOTH DORKY COMPUTER PEOPLE THAT HOOKED UP ONLINE------------, SHE MADE ME REALIZE YOU CAN START A REAL WORLD RELATIONSHIP IN THE WWW------------ WORLD, HECK SHES BEEN DOIN SINCE SHE HAD HER 8086 AND CHATTING ON WEST------------ HARFORD BULLETIN BOARDS WAY BEFORE AOL. I KEEP GETTING DRAWN IN BY REALLY------------ LAID BACK PEOPLE, SORRY KIDS NO SEX TOOK PLACE, WE DIDN-T EVEN WAKE------------ UP IN EMBARRASSING POSITIONS IN OUR TEENY TENT, SO JESS REST ASSURED.--------------------------  WATERMELON----------------  FOOD WAS INFLATED TO THE POINT OF IDIOCRACY. 4 DOLLARS FOR WATER?------------! YEAH. BUT THERE WAS A STAND SELLIN WATERMELON FOR A DOLLAR AND THAT------------ WATERELON WAS GOOOOD. OTHER GOOD EATS WAS THE BIG MEAL AT THE TIBETAN------------ STAND AND AL THE VEGETARIAN DELIGHTS OFFERED TO ME, ITS NICE TO NOT------------ HAVE TO GO TO A HOT DOG START TO ASK FOR JUST THE BUNS.----------------  BAD THINGS----------------  BATHROOMS----------------  250,000 YOUNG ADULTS CAN NOT USE PORT OF JONS CORRECTLY, THEY-RE TOO------------ MUCH OF A TARGET TO DEFACE, PUSH OVER AND SCREW UP. I WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY------------ PAID 20 BUCKS MORE ON MY TICKET FOR SOMETHING, ANYTHING BETTER. THE------------ SMALL WAS QUITE A SCREAM, AND HAVING THE BATHROOMS RIGHT NEXT TO THE------------ CLEAN WATER WAS A REALLY GOOD IDEA, REALLY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE------------ WATER SYSTEM----------------  THERE WAS FREE WATER AVAILABLE TO US. IT CAME OUT OF PIPES THAT WERE------------ ATTACHED TO THESE HUGE CONCRETE THINGS, BUT BY THE SECOND DAY, ALL THE------------ FIXTURES WERE BUSTED AND NOT IN ANY SHAPE TO USE, SO WATER GOT SCARE------------ OR JUST HARD TO GET TO. WHAT WAS REALLY SOMETHING THEY MUST HAVE LOOKED------------ OVER WAS THE DRAINAGE TO ALL THE WATER THAT FREELY FLOWED OUTTA THE------------ PIPES. IE, THERE WAS NONE. THERE WAS A GROUP OF BATHROOMS ON THE TOP------------ OF A SMALL HILL IN THE CONCERT AREA. EACH DAY I WALKED NEAR IT, THE------------ MUDDINESS OF THE GRASS THAT SAT BESIDE IT GOT LARGER AND LARGER TILL------------ IT COVERED CLEAR ACROSS THE WHOLE AIRCRAFT FIELD, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE------------ NOT TO GET YOUR FEET WET AND MUDDY AND AS SUCH MY FEET STAYED NICELY------------ WET FOR FOUR DAYS, DISH PAN HANDS ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO MY FEET THESE------------ DAYS.--------------  THE PLAYLIST--------------  THE LIST OF WHEN THE BANDS WERE PLAYING WAS AVAILABLE BUT IT GOT AS SPECIFIC---------- AS WHAT DAY THEY WERE ON AND OF WHAT ORDER. THERE WAS EVEN GROUPS NOT---------- ON THE BIL THAT WEREN-T ON THE LIST AT ALL, WHICH MADE TRYING TO SCHEDULE---------- YOUR DAY IMPOSSIBLE. THE VIOLENT FEMMES WERE SUPPOSED TO PLAY, THEY WEREN-T---------- EVEN THERE, DAMN WEBSITE. I HATE WHEN INFORMATON IS FALSIFIED, OH WELL.----------------------  THE PRICES--------------  EVERYTHING WAS EXPENSIVE--------------  BIG SHOCK-------------------------  WHEN I GOT HALFWAY THROUGH WRITING THIS, I REALIZED I COULD NEVER WRITE----------- EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO ME, THERES TOO MANY DETAILS AND ODD STUFF----------- THAT HAPPENED. I GUESS THIS IS JUST GOIN TO BE SOMETHING TO REMIND MYSELF-----------, TO LOOK AT ONE DAY TO USE TO GET ALL THE FINER POINTS BACK INTO MI NOGGIN.----------- MAYBE YOU WENT TO THIS SHOW, AND HAVE ANOTHER TWIST TO IT, I-D LOVE----------- TO HEAR, I-LL LINK TO YOURS, OR EVEN POST IT FOR YOU LETS---------------------------------------------- HEAR---- IT.---------------  SORRY I DIDN'T TAKE ANY PICS, SOMETHING BOUT BRINGING MY CANON AE------------1 WITH ALL ITS LENSES, FLASH AND MOTOR DRIVE DIDN'T SIT WELL IN MY MIND-----------, LUCKILY, THIS CRAZY PERSON---------------------------------------------------------------------- SNAPS----------- SOME GOOD ONES-------------------------------------  UPDATE---- 8/7/99: MY FRIEND KELLY WHO I WENT WITH PUT UP----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HER----------- STORY----, WITH LOTS OF---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PICTURES--------------- OF THE WHOLE THING, YEAH---------------!
