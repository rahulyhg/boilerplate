ON THE 2ND ROUND----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4 FEB-------------------------- 2004 THE DPRK ANNOUNCEMENT ON 3 FEBRUARY 20---THAT IT HAS AGREED TO--------------- RESUME THE 6-WAY TALKS IN BEIJING ON 25 FEBRUARY IS A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT---------------, BUT-THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT EITHER PYONGYANG OR WASHINGTON ARE--------------- READY FOR THE SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS NECESSARY TO MAKE PROGRESS--------------- ON A SOLUTION FOR THE NUCLEAR CRISIS.-------------------- THE 6 PARTIES HAVE FAILED TO AGREE ON A PRE-TALKS STATEMENT TO--------------- DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF THIS ROUND, AS THE DPRK HAD INSISTED IN DECEMBER-----------------AND IT SEEMS THE SCOPE IS MINIMAL: THE DPRK WILL PRESENT DETAILS--------------- ON ITS PROPOSAL TO FREEZE ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM, AND THE OTHER PARTIES--------------- WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO PUT THEIR POSITIONS FORWARD. AS THE US, SOUTH--------------- KOREA, AND JAPAN ARE CLOSELY COORDINATING THEIR STRATEGY, AND CHINA--------------- AND RUSSIA'S ONLY CONCERN SEEMS TO BE TO AVOID A MILITARY CONFRONTATION---------------, THE GAME WILL BE PLAYED BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND PYONGYANG.------------------- WE SHARE THE PESSIMISM VOICED BY JACK PRITCHARD, FORMER US NEGOTIATOR--------------- FOR NORTH KOREA ON 21 JANUARY 2004 AFTER HIS VISIT TO PYONGYANG:--------------- '---I AM CONCERNED THAT THE NEXT ROUND OF SIX-PARTY TALKS WILL FAIL--------------- AND PYONGYANG WILL WITHDRAW FROM THE DIPLOMATIC PROCESS----.'------------------------------------------------------------ ELUSIVE TALKS---------------------------------------- 15 JAN----------------------------- 2004 THIS ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED BY--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ASIA--------------- TIMES ONLINE---- ON 24 JANUARY 2004 IN THE SPEAKING FREELY SECTION.----------------------- ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE DPRK'-----S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE--------------- NPT THERE ARE FEW REASONS TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A SOLUTION OF THE--------------- NUCLEAR CRISIS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. PYONGYANG HAS VOWED TO FURTHER--------------- BUILD-UP ITS MILITARY FORCE WHILE CLAIMING TO BE IN FAVOUR OF A--------------- NEGOTIATED PEACEFUL RESOLUTION, AND IN FACT WASHINGTON IS DOING--------------- EXACTLY THE SAME. AS RUSSIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER LOSYUKOV PUT--------------- IT LAST WEEK 'MISTRUST AND EXCESSIVE DEMANDS ON EACH OTHER' BY WASHINGTON--------------- AND PYONGYANG ARE THE REASONS FOR THE CONTINUING DELAY OF THE SECOND--------------- ROUND OF 6-WAY TALKS.---------------------------------------- AS A SIGN OF FRUSTRATION, SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER YOON ADMITTED--------------- HE IS HOPING THE TALKS CAN BE HELD IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR.--------------- SOUTH KOREA, RUSSIA, AND JAPAN SEEM TO BE LESS AND LESS INVOLVED--------------- IN THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE TALKS; THE CONDITIONS ARE SET IN PYONGYANG--------------- AND WASHINGTON, AND BOTH THINK THEY HAVE BEIJING ON THEIR SIDE.--------------- SEOUL AND TOKYO ARE KEPT IN THE LOOP TO-FOOT THE BILL IF ECONOMIC--------------- ASSISTANCE IS EVER GOING TO BE PROVIDED, AS THEY DID FOR THE KEDO--------------- PROJECT. JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA HAVE PAID A TOTAL OF US$1.3B, OR--------------- 70% OF THE TOTAL, WHILE THE US WITH ONLY 21% SEEMS TO BE FIRMLY--------------- IN CHARGE OF THE CONSORTIUM.---------------------------------------- AFTER THE US HINTED IT IS WILLING TO PROVIDE SECURITY ASSURANCES---------------, PYONGYANG HAS SPECIFIED ITS ADDITIONAL DEMANDS IN EXCHANGE FOR REFREEZING--------------- THE YONGBYON NUCLEAR FACILITIES. IN FACT THESE DEMANDS ARE SIMILAR--------------- TO WHAT PYONGYANG SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THE AGREED FRAMEWORK--------------- OF 1994: DELIST THE DPRK AS A SPONSOR OF TERRORISM, LIFT POLITICAL---------------, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY SANCTIONS, AND SUPPLY HEAVY OIL AND OTHER--------------- ENERGY RESOURCES TO THE DPRK. THE US WILL NOT ACCEPT A MERE FREEZE--------------- OF YONGBYON; IT IS PREPARED TO PROVIDE SECURITY ASSURANCES, BUT--------------- ONLY IN RETURN OF A DPRK PROMISE TO DISMANTLE ALL ITS NUCLEAR FACILITIES---------------, IRREVERSIBLY, BECAUSE AS US SECRETARY OF STATE POWELL SAYS-----, `WE--------------- DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN.'--------------------------------------------- OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THERE HAS BEEN INTENSIVE DIPLOMACY TO COME--------------- TO AN AGREEMENT ON THE SCOPE OF THE FIRST STEP TO BE TAKEN BY BOTH--------------- SIDES. THE DPRK HAS BEEN DEMANDING SUCH A PRE-TALKS AGREEMENT BECAUSE--------------- IT DOES NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN A USELESS TALKING SESSION LIKE--------------- THE FIRST ROUND BACK IN AUGUST. IT LOOKS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT--------------- THE US WILL OFFER ANY ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE OR IMPROVED POLITICAL--------------- RELATIONS IN ADDITION TO A SECURITY GUARANTEE IN THIS FIRST PHASE.---------------------------------------- ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WILL INEVITABLY COMPLICATE NEGOTIATIONS IS THE--------------- ALLEGED DPRK URANIUM ENRICHMENT PROGRAM, WHICH WAS IN FACT THE TRIGGER--------------- OF THE CURRENT CRISIS. THE US WILL OF COURSE WANT TO INCLUDE THIS--------------- PROGRAM IN A DPRK PROMISE TO END ITS NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES, BUT LAST--------------- WEEK IT BECAME CLEAR THAT EVEN-CHINA IS NOT CONVINCED THE DPRK ACTUALLY--------------- HAS SUCH A URANIUM PROGRAM. CHINESE OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY SAID THE--------------- US GOVERNMENT BRIEFING PROVIDED TO THEM HAD NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT--------------- TO CONVINCE CHINA THAT THE DPRK HAD SUCH A PROGRAM. IN THE CURRENT--------------- CLIMATE, NO COUNTRY WILL INDEED EASILY ACCEPT US INTELLIGENCE ON--------------- THE EXISTENCE OF WMD FACILITIES IN AN AXIS-OF-EVIL MEMBER COUNTRY.---------------------------------------- REFERRING TO LIBYA, THE DPRK FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED A STATEMENT--------------- SAYING THE US SHOULD NOT EXPECT PYONGYANG TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE--------------- AND RENOUNCE ITS WEAPONS. THE WORKERS'----- PARTY NEWSPAPER RECENTLY--------------- ARGUED IRAQ MADE A BIG MISTAKE ACCEPTING THE WEAPONS INSPECTIONS--------------- AND NOT PREPARING FOR WAR. HOW AN INTERNATIONAL INSPECTION MECHANISM--------------- BEYOND THE YONGBYON FACILITIES WILL EVER WORK IN THE DPRK REMAINS--------------- A KEY QUESTION. INDEED AS UN INSPECTOR HANS BLIX NOTICED, IT IS--------------- HARD TO PROVE THAT SOMETHING DOES NOT EXIST. IF THE US INSISTS ON--------------- NATIONWIDE INSPECTIONS WHILE THE DPRK CONTINUES TO DENY HAVING A--------------- URANIUM PROGRAM, NEGOTIATIONS WILL GET STUCK, AND THE KIM DYNASTY--------------- WILL REMAIN IN WAR-MODE AS IT HAS BEEN SINCE IT ESTABLISHED THE--------------- DPRK 55 YEARS AGO. THE-IMPERIALIST THREAT MIGHT WELL BECOME A SELF-FULFILLING--------------- PROPHECY.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NO MORAL HIGH GROUND IN--------------- BEIJING------------------------- 20 AUG----------------------------- 2003 THIS ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED BY--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ASIA--------------- TIMES ONLINE---- ON 23 AUGUST 2003 IN THE SPEAKING FREELY SECTION.----------------------- NEXT WEEK ALL EYES-WILL BE ON BEIJING WHILE THE SIX POWERS WILL--------------- SIT DOWN TO START NEGOTIATING A SOLUTION FOR THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR--------------- CRISIS. A SORT OF MINI-UNITED NATIONS SESSION, WITH THE THREE HEAVYWEIGHTS--------------- OF THE FIVE PERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, AND THE--------------- THREE LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS: JAPAN, AND NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA. A YEAR--------------- AGO, WHILE PYONGYANG'S BILATERAL TIES WITH SEOUL AND TOKYO WERE--------------- BLOSSOMING AFTER KOIZUMI'S VISIT TO PYONGYANG, THIS SEATING ARRANGEMENT--------------- WOULD HAVE MADE SOME SENSE.------------------- HOWEVER, SINCE THE START OF THE NUCLEAR CRISIS AFTER THE VISIT--------------- OF US ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES KELLY TO PYONGYANG IN OCTOBER--------------- 2002, OLD ALLIANCES HAVE BEEN REINFORCED, AND AT LEAST IN THE MIND--------------- OF THE DPRK THE THREE (EX)COMMUNIST STATES WILL BE ON ONE SIDE OF--------------- THE TABLE, FACING THE US AND ITS ALLIES, WHO NONE OF THEM HAS OFFICIAL--------------- DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH PYONGYANG, ON THE OTHER-SIDE. BUT THE--------------- COLD WAR DIVISIONS HAVE BLURRED;-BOTH MOSCOW AND BEIJING HAVE CLOSE--------------- ECONOMIC TIES WITH THEIR THREE FORMER CAPITALIST FOES. THEY HAVE--------------- ALSO STATED THAT THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT THE PRESENCE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS--------------- ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. AS THE REGIONAL NUCLEAR POWERS, IT IS IN--------------- BOTH THEIR INTEREST TO MAINTAIN THIS STRATEGIC--- STATUS QUO----.--------------------------------- THE TWO OLD COMRADES DID SUGGEST THAT THEY CAN PLAY A ROLE IN GUARANTEEING--------------- THE DPRK'S SECURITY, AS WASHINGTON HAS CLEARLY STATED IT WILL NOT--------------- OFFER THE FORMAL NON-AGGRESSION TREATY PYONGYANG IS DEMANDING. THE--------------- RUSSIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER LOSYUKOV SAID THAT IT IS ONLY LOGICAL--------------- THAT PYONGYANG SEEKS A SECURITY GUARANTEE; MOSCOW AND BEIJING ARE--------------- READY TO OFFER A COLLECTIVE SECURITY GUARANTEE IF WHAT THE US IS--------------- PREPARED TO OFFER DOES NOT SATISFY THE DPRK. PYONGYANG HAS ALREADY--------------- REPLIED THAT THIS IS BESIDE THE POINT, IT HAS NEVER CONSIDERED EITHER--------------- RUSSIA OR CHINA TO BE A THREAT.-------------------- ONE OF THE MORE WORRYING COMMENTS MADE OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS--------------- WAS A STATEMENT BY FORMER US AMBASSADOR ROBERT GREY IN THE WASHINGTON--------------- TIMES OF 14 AUGUST, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE US HAS COME TO REGARD--------------- THE PRINCIPLE OF PRE-EMPTIVE ACTION AS INTERNATIONAL LAW:--------------------- NORTH KOREA MUST UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION---------------, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS PREPARED, HOWEVER RELUCTANTLY, TO--------------- USE FORCE TO PUT AN END TO NORTH KOREA'S PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.---------------------- IT IS UNCLEAR WHO GREY HAS IN MIND WHEN HE SPEAKS OF THE INTERNATIONAL--------------- COMMUNITY; IN ANY CASE AFTER IRAQ IT IS RATHER UNLIKELY THAT THE--------------- UN SECURITY COUNCIL WOULD ALLOW THE USE OF FORCE TO ATTACK A SOVEREIGN--------------- COUNTRY THAT IS NO IMMINENT THREAT TO WORLD PEACE. FOR MONTHS THE--------------- US HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR A UN SECURITY COUNCIL STATEMENT CONDEMNING--------------- THE DPRK FOR ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM, BUT RUSSIA AND CHINA HAVE BLOCKED--------------- THIS MOVE, KNOWING THAT IT WOULD ONLY COMPLICATE A SOLUTION.-------------------- OF THE SIX PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE TALKS, ONLY THE US IS STRESSING--------------- THAT THE MILITARY OPTION REMAINS ON THE TABLE. THE CLOSEST THE US--------------- HAS GOT TO A 'COALITION OF THE WILLING', IS ITS PROLIFERATION SECURITY--------------- INITIATIVE (PSI), A GROUP OF 8 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES PLUS AUSTRALIA---------------, JAPAN, AND THE US. THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE INTERDICTION OF DPRK--------------- SHIPS EXPORTING ALLEGED WMD, AND AT MEETINGS IN MADRID AND BRISBANE---------------, THEY HAVE SO FAR AGREED TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION AND HOLD INTERDICTION--------------- TRAINING EXERCISES, STARTING NEXT MONTH OFF THE AUSTRALIAN COAST.------------------- THE PRIORITY OF ALL SIX COUNTRIES AROUND THE TABLE NEXT WEEK WILL--------------- BE TO DEFEND THEIR OWN NATIONAL SECURITY. NONE OF THE PARTICIPATING--------------- COUNTRIES SHOULD PUT ITSELF ON THE MORAL HIGH GROUND AND CLAIM TO--------------- REPRESENT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. IN ORDER TO MAKE PROGRESS--------------- AND MAKE THE WORLD A SAFER PLACE, THEY WILL ALL NEED TO GIVE IN--------------- ORDER TO RECEIVE. WASHINGTON'S DECLARED RELUCTANCE TO NEGOTIATE---------------, DESPITE ITS VERBAL SUPPORT FOR A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION, WILL BE THE--------------- KEY ISSUE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ PANMUNJOM CIRCUS----------------------------------------------- 27 JULY----------------------------- 2003 THIS ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED BY--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ASIA--------------- TIMES ONLINE---- ON 1 AUGUST 2003 IN THE SPEAKING FREELY SECTION.----------------------- ON 27 JULY 2003 IT WAS EXACTLY 50 YEARS AGO THAT THE KOREAN WAR--------------- CAME TO AN END WITH THE SIGNING OF THE ARMISTICE AGREEMENT BY THE--------------- DPRK, CHINA, AND THE US-LED UNITED NATIONS COMMAND (UNC). IN THE--------------- DPRK MASS CELEBRATIONS WERE HELD TO COMMEMORATE THE VICTORY IN THE--------------- FATHERLAND LIBERATION WAR. ON THE SOUTH SIDE AS WELL, US GENERAL--------------- LAPORTE STATED IN PANMUNJOM THAT THE ARMISTICE REPRESENTS NOTHING--------------- SHORT OF VICTORY. THESE CLAIMS ILLUSTRATE THAT DURING 50 YEARS OF--------------- NON-WAR, NOTHING MUCH HAS CHANGED. OR HAS IT?------------------- WHILE THE US FORCES DID THEIR UTMOST BEST-DURING THE VARIOUS CEREMONIES--------------- TO STRESS THE-UN ALLIANCE AGAINST THE 'COMMUNIST AGGRESSION', ACTUALLY--------------- MOST OF THE 21 NATIONS THAT CAME TO DEFEND SOUTH KOREA UNDER THE--------------- UN FLAG HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DPRK--------------- OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS. MOST OF THEM NOW HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS--------------- WITH PYONGYANG. PRIME MINISTER HELEN CLARK OF NEW ZEALAND, WHICH----------------ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATICE RELATIONS WITH THE DPRK IN 2001, WAS ALLOWED--------------- TO MAKE A SPEECH AT THE CEREMONY IN PANMUNJOM, BUT HER CALL FOR--------------- A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE PRESENT NUCLEAR CRISIS CONTRASTED SHARPLY--------------- WITH LAPORTE'S MEMORIES OF THE GLORIOUS PAST AND A CONFIDENT FUTURE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WHEN GENERAL LAPORTE PRESENTED A UN-FLAG TO PRIME MINISTER CLARK--------------- AND SOUTH KOREAN GENERAL PAEK AS A GIFT, PYONGYANG MUST HAVE BEEN--------------- OUTRAGED. THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THE SOVIET UNION WAS ABSENT FROM--------------- THE SECURITY COUNCIL IN 1950 IN PROTEST AGAINST THE EXCLUSION OF--------------- COMMUNIST CHINA, HAS ALLOWED THE US TO CONTINUE TO USE THE UN COVER--------------- FOR 50 YEARS. THIS HAS GENERATED THE-STRANGE CONTRADICTION THAT--------------- COUNTRIES PART OF THE ARMISTICE AGREEMENT--AND THUS STILL TECHNICALLY--------------- AT WAR WITH THE DPRK, ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS--------------- WITH PYONGYANG. THIS PARADOX PROVES THAT THE ONLY COUNTRIES THAT--------------- REALLY MATTER IN THE UNC ARE THE US AND THE ROK. IRONICALLY THE--------------- DPRK HAS ALSO BEEN A MEMBER OF THE UN SINCE 1991, WHEN IT JOINED--------------- AT THE SAME TIME AS THE ROK------------------- BUT OF COURSE THESE CEREMONIES WERE ALL ABOUT THE WAR VETERANS---------------, AGED 70+ NOWADAYS. THEY FEEL PROUD FOR HAVING CONTRIBUTED TO PREVENT--------------- THE THIRD WORLD WAR, AND ENABLED THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA TO BECOME--------------- WHAT IT IS TODAY: A THRIVING DEMOCRACY RESPECTED AROUND THE WORLD.--------------- TO THEIR CONVENIENCE THEY OFTEN FORGET THAT FOR MANY YEARS AFTER--------------- THE WAR, SOUTH KOREA WAS MUCH POORER THAN THE NORTH, AND THAT SEOUL--------------- ONLY STARTED TO CATCH UP ECONOMICALLY DURING THE 18 YEARS OF MILITARY--------------- DICTATORSHIP OF PARK CHUNG-HEE. HUNDREDS OF SOUTH KOREANS DIED IN--------------- THEIR STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY, WHILE THE UNC WAS GUARDING THE COUNTRY--------------- AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE TRUCE VILLAGE OF PANMUNJOM REMINDS SOME VISITORS------------------- OF AN AMUSEMENT PARK, AND IT CERTAINLY LOOKED LIKE ONE DURING------------------- THE CEREMONIES ON 27 JULY------ AMERICAN ROCK MUSIC AND STALLS------------------- SELLING ARMISTICE MERCHANDISE WELCOMED US IN THE JOINT SECURITY------------------- AREA. US VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS DRESSED IN ALL COLOURS------------------- OF THE RAINBOW WERE IN THE MAJORITY. AFTER THE SPEECHES WE WERE------------------- OFFERED A LAVISH BUFFET IN THE MAIN BUILDING AT 20 METERS FROM------------------- THE MILITARY DEMARCATION LINE, AND SOME US SOLDIERS ENCOURAGED------------------- US TO TAKE FOOD OUTSIDE SO THE NORTH KOREAN SOLDIERS COULD WATCH------------------- US EATING. 'ONLY THE ELITE SERVES HERE', THE US SERGEANT HAD------------------- PROUDLY TOLD US ON THE BUS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHEREAS THE EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE START OF THE KOREAN WAR--------------- 53 YEARS AGO WILL REMAIN A POINT OF DISCUSSION, IT IS CLEAR TODAY--------------- THAT A PEACE TREATY, AS RECOMMENDED IN THE ORIGINAL ARMISTICE AGREEMENT--------------- WITHIN 3 MONTHS, IS LONG OVERDUE. IT IS SAD THAT CELEBRATING--------------- 50 YEARS OF STATUS-QUO HAS NOT BEEN AN INCENTIVE TO THE OTHER UNC MEMBERS--------------- TO URGE THE US TO NEGOTIATE SUCH A PEACE TREATY WITH PYONGYANG---------------, OR IN CASE WASHINGTON CONTINUES ITS CONFRONTATIONAL STANCE, TO FORMALLY--------------- WITHDRAW FROM THE UNC.----------------------------------------------------------------- AWKWARD ANNIVERSARIES---------------------------------------- 2 JUNE----------------------------- 2003 THIS ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED BY--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ASIA--------------- TIMES ONLINE---- ON 4 JUNE 2003 IN THE SPEAKING FREELY SECTION.----------------------- ON 27 JULY THIS YEAR IT WILL BE EXACTLY 50 YEARS AGO THAT THE DPRK---------------, THE PRC, AND THE UN SIGNED THE ARMISTICE THAT BROUGHT THE KOREAN--------------- WAR TO AN END. ON BOTH SIDES OF THE DMZ THERE WILL BE CEREMONIES--------------- TO COMMEMORATE THIS EVENT: COMMUNIST GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD WILL--------------- CELEBRATE THE NORTH'S VICTORY OVER THE IMPERIALIST FORCES, WHILE--------------- THE 16 NATIONS-THAT CAME TO DEFEND SOUTH KOREA UNDER THE UN FLAG--------------- WILL REMEMBER HOW THEY ROLLED BACK THE COMMUNIST AGGRESSION. CELEBRATING--------------- THESE OLD ALLIANCES WILL UNDERSCORE THE DIVISION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA--------------- AND IT SHOULD IN THAT SENSE BE A PAINFUL AFFAIR FOR BOTH KOREAS.----------------HOWEVER, PYONGYANG HAS MANAGED TO TURN ITS MEMORY OF THE KOREAN--------------- WAR INTO RESISTANCE AGAINST THE US IMPERIALISTS, WHICH CONTINUES--------------- UNTIL TODAY AND IS IN FACT THE MAIN LEGITIMISING FORCE OF ITS REGIME.------------------- WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE CRAB CATCHING-SEASON, THE NORTH AND SOUTH--------------- HAVE ALSO STARTED ACCUSING EACH OTHER AGAIN OF VIOLATIONS OF THEIR--------------- TERRITORIAL WATERS. ON 1 JUNE THE SOUTH KOREAN NAVY EVEN FIRED WARNING--------------- SHOTS AT NORTH KOREAN FISHING BOATS. LAST YEAR SIMILAR INCIDENTS--------------- LED TO A NAVAL CLASH WITH 4 DEATHS ON THE SOUTH KOREAN SIDE. IF--------------- THE ISSUE OF THE NORTHERN LIMIT LINE (NLL) ACTS AS A BAROMETER FOR--------------- INTER-KOREAN RELATIONS, WE CAN SURELY EXPECT MORE FIREWORKS SOON.------------------------------------- BEFORE WE GET TO THE ARMISTICE CELEBRATIONS IN JULY, ANOTHER KOREAN--------------- ANNIVERSARY WILL PASS: ON 15 JUNE 2003 IT WILL HAVE BEEN THREE YEARS--------------- SINCE THE INTER-KOREAN SUMMIT BETWEEN KIM JONG IL AND KIM DAE-JUNG--------------- IN PYONGYANG. THE RESULT OF THIS HISTORIC MEETING WAS THE 15 JUNE--------------- JOINT DECLARATION, IN WHICH THEY AGREED TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC COOPERATION--------------- AND PROMOTE REUNIFICATION. SINCE THEN, SOME PROGRESS HAS INDEED--------------- BEEN MADE: SOUTH KOREAN TOURISTS WERE ABLE TO CROSS THE DMZ BY BUS--------------- FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST FEBRUARY TO VISIT THE MOUNT KUMGANG RESORT--------------- IN THE NORTH, BUT THAT ROAD WAS CLOSED AGAIN AFTER TWO WEEKS.-------------------- RECONNECTION OF THE RAILWAY LINES IN THE EAST AND THE WEST HAS--------------- BEEN DELAYED SO MANY TIMES THAT THE LATEST AGREEMENT AT THE DIFFICULT--------------- ECONOMIC TALKS AT THE END OF MAY TO HOLD THE CEREMONIES ON 10 JUNE--------------- THIS YEAR SEEMS FAR TOO OPTIMISTIC. THE SAME GOES FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT--------------- THAT THE KAESONG INDUSTRIAL PARK WILL FINALLY HAVE ITS GROUND-BREAKING--------------- CEREMONY AT THE END OF JUNE------ PYONGYANG AND SEOUL HAVE ALLOWED--------------- THEIR WORKERS, WOMEN, ATHLETES, AND FAMILIES TO-MEET EACH OTHER---------------, SHARE THEIR SADNESS ABOUT THE NATIONAL DIVISION AND ISSUE NATIONALIST--------------- STATEMENTS CALLING FOR REUNIFICATION; NEVERTHELESS ON A GOVERNMENT--------------- LEVEL TRUST REMAINS THIN. AS A RESULT OF THE NUCLEAR CRISIS, TODAY--------------- BOTH SIDES ARE USING THE JOINT DECLARATION MERELY TO CRITICISE EACH--------------- OTHERS BEHAVIOUR.-------------------- PYONGYANG RECENTLY CLAIMED SEOUL WAS VIOLATING THE DECLARATION--------------- BY 'HURLING MUD AT THE DIGNIFIED SYSTEM OF THE DPRK' WHEN THE SOUTH--------------- KOREAN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER RA JONG-YIL SAID ABOUT INTER-KOREAN--------------- COOPERATION THAT THE NORTH'S REGIME SHOULD BE DISTINGUISHED FROM--------------- ITS RESIDENTS. WHEN CHIEF NORTH KOREAN DELEGATE PAK CHANG RYON THREATENED--------------- WITH AN 'UNSPEAKABLE DISASTER' AT THE ECONOMIC TALKS LAST WEEK IF--------------- THE SOUTH WOULD TURN TO CONFRONTATION, SEOUL SUSPENDED THE TALKS--------------- SAYING THAT SUCH A STATEMENT WENT AGAINST THE DECLARATION. THEN--------------- AFTER TWO DAYS OF IMPASSE, THEY SUDDENLY MANAGED TO AGREE ON YET--------------- ANOTHER OPTIMISTIC TIMEFRAME FOR SOME COOPERATION PROJECTS. THESE--------------- TWO EXAMPLES SHOW THAT EVEN WITHOUT OUTSIDE POWERS INVOLVED, THE--------------- TWO KOREAN GOVERNMENTS DO NOT EASILY FIND COMMON GROUND.------------------- PYONGYANG DOES-NOT MISS A CHANCE TO-BRING UP THE DECLARATION WHENEVER--------------- IT GETS THE IMPRESSION THAT SEOUL IS GETTING TOO CLOSE TO WASHINGTON---------------, AS WITH PRESIDENT ROH MOO-HYUN'S US VISIT AND JOINT STATEMENT WITH--------------- PRESIDENT BUSH ON 14 MAY. THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME IS AIMING AT NATIONALIST--------------- AND ANTI-US FEELINGS IN THE SOUTH WITH ITS MANTRA OF 'ACHIEVING--------------- RECONCILIATION AND REUNIFICATION BY OUR NATION ITSELF UNDER THE--------------- BANNER OF THE JUNE 15 JOINT DECLARATION'. PRESIDENT ROH HAS A HARD--------------- TIME ALIGNING HIS STRATEGY FOR THE NUCLEAR CRISIS WITH WASHINGTON---------------, WITHOUT DAMAGING INTER-KOREAN RELATIONS. PYONGYANG KEEPS WAVING--------------- THE DECLARATION ACCUSING SEOUL OF PRO-US SERVILE DIPLOMACY, WHILE--------------- IT IS FURTHER BUILDING UP ITS MILITARY UNDER THE 'SONGUN' ARMY-FIRST--------------- POLICY. WITH ALL THAT ARTILLERY AIMED AT SEOUL NO HALF-WORKING JOINT--------------- DECLARATION SHOULD REASSURE ANYONE IN SOUTH KOREA.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ANTI-IMPERIALISM RECYCLED ------------------------------------------MAY-------------------------- 2003 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY LITTLE TO DISCUSS AT THE-RECENT--------------- TRILATERAL TALKS IN BEIJING. THE DPRK PUT FORWARD WHAT IT CALLS--------------- ITS BOLD NEW PROPOSAL, AND THE-US REPEATED IT WILL NOT NEGOTIATE--------------- BEFORE PYONGYANG ABANDONS ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS. THE US ADMINISTRATION--------------- AGREES WITH RUSSIA, SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, AND CHINA TO WORK ON A PEACEFUL--------------- SOLUTION BASED ON DIALOGUE, BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE WORD DIALOGUE--------------- HAS A DIFFERENT MEANING TO THE GOVERNMENTS INVOLVED.-------------------- MEANWHILE PYONGYANG IS STEPPING UP ITS WAR RHETORIC, MAKING SOUTH--------------- KOREA AND JAPAN NERVOUS. THE STANDOFF WITH THE IMPERIALIST SUPERPOWER--------------- ADDS LEGITIMACY TO THE REGIME OF KIM JONG IL, WHO CONTINUES IN HIS--------------- FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS PROTECTING THE COUNTRY AGAINST THE US AND JAPAN.--------------- THIS ANTI-IMPERIALIST STRUGGLE IS THE ESSENCE OF THE PYONGYANG REGIME---------------, AND INDEED OF THE DPRK AS A STATE. THE CURRENT CRISIS JUSTIFIES--------------- YEARS OF ARMY-FIRST POLICY AND STRENGTHENS THE LEADERSHIP OF KIM--------------- JONG IL. OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS, THE DPRK PROPAGANDA HAS NOT CHANGED--------------- AT ALL, BUT IF IT SOUNDED A BIT OUT-OF-DATE TEN YEARS AGO, UNFORTUNATELY--------------- TODAY IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE AGAIN. THE US DOCTRINE OF PRE-EMPTIVE--------------- STRIKES HAS ALLOWED THE DPRK TO RECYCLE HALF A CENTURY OF PROPAGANDA---------------, AND PUTS-KIM JONG IL IN HIS FAVOURITE ROLE, PREPARING FOR A WAR--------------- TO DEFEND THE COUNTRY AGAINST THE US IMPERIALISTS.------------------- OBVIOUSLY KIM JONG IL WOULD HAVE TO WORRY MUCH MORE ABOUT HIS POSITION--------------- IF RELATIONS WITH THE US WERE IMPROVING. AS SOON AS NORTH KOREA--------------- BECOMES A NORMAL MEMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE PYONGYANG--------------- REGIME WILL HAVE TO RE-INVENT ITSELF, TO GAIN LEGITIMACY IN THE--------------- ABSENCE OF ANY EXTERNAL THREATS. MAYBE THIS INSIGHT COULD HELP FOREIGN ---------------GOVERNMENTS WHO WANT TO SEE CHANGE IN NORTH KOREA TO TAKE A MORE--------------- CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH TO THE PYONGYANG REGIME.------------------------------------------------------------- A CHALLENGE FOR CHINA---------------------------------------- 18 APRIL-------------------------- 2003 IT ALL WENT RATHER FAST AFTER PYONGYANG'S INDICATION THAT IT WOULD--------------- NOT INSIST ON A BILATERAL FORMAT FOR TALKS WITH THE US IF WASHINGTON--------------- WAS WILLING TO CHANGE ITS HOSTILE POLICY TOWARDS THE DPRK. THE BUSH--------------- ADMINISTRATION IS VERY PLEASED THAT CHINA HAS FINALLY DECIDED TO--------------- PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE, PROPOSING TRILATERAL TALKS IN BEIJING.------------------- THE FACT THAT THESE THREE PARTIES HAVE AGREED TO TALK IS IN ITSELF--------------- A BREAKTHROUGH, BUT THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE BUSH--------------- ADMINISTRATION WILL ADOPT A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH THEN IT HAS--------------- UNTIL NOW. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES KELLY WILL DEMAND--------------- THAT PYONGYANG DISMANTLES ITS TWO NUCLEAR PROGRAMS BEFORE HE WILL--------------- OFFER ANYTHING IN RETURN. MEANWHILE HE WILL INSIST THAT SOUTH KOREA--------------- AND JAPAN SHOULD JOIN THE TALKS. PYONGYANG DOES NOT WANT TO INVOLVE--------------- SEOUL AND TOKYO; IT HAS BEEN RATHER FRUSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT--------------- THE CURRENT CRISIS, WHICH PYONGYANG INSISTS IS ONLY BETWEEN THE--------------- US AND THE DPRK, HAS DESTROYED MUCH OF THE PROGRESS IT HAD MADE--------------- WITH SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN RECENTLY.------------------- FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF PYONGYANG, THE SECURITY ISSUE CAN ONLY BE--------------- SETTLED IN DIRECT TALKS. HOWEVER, A TRILATERAL SETTING WITH CHINA--------------- IS THE NEXT BEST THING, AS PYONGYANG PROBABLY EXPECTS CHINA TO SUPPORT--------------- ITS BASIC ANALYSIS THAT THE US IS A THREAT TO NORTH KOREA, AND BEARS--------------- RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRISIS. ONCE THEY CAN AGREE ON THE NECESSARY--------------- STEPS TO ELIMINATE THE MUTUAL SECURITY CONCERNS, SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL--------------- MONITORING, A NON-AGGRESSION TREATY ETC, MAYBE PYONGYANG WILL ACCEPT--------------- SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, AND POSSIBLY RUSSIA, AROUND THE TABLE TO DISCUSS--------------- AID AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH THE NORTH. HOWEVER, SUCH A PROCESS--------------- REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THE PARTIES, WHICH IS CURRENTLY--------------- NON-EXISTANT. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER CHINA WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD--------------- THE NECESSARY TRUST BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND PYONGYANG.----------------------------------------------------------- PYONGYANG'-----S LOST FRIENDS---------------------------------------- 21 MARCH----------------------------------------------- 2003 ONLY 6 MONTHS AFTER THE HISTORIC MEETING IN PYONGYANG BETWEEN JAPANESE--------------- PM KOIZUMI AND THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG IL, JAPAN IS DEPLOYING--------------- ITS AEGIS SURVEILLANCE SHIPS TO MONITOR NORTH KOREAN MISSILE OPERATIONS---------------, AND WARNS PYONGYANG IT WILL SCRAP THEIR JOINT DECLARATION IF THE--------------- NORTH CARRIES OUT A BALLISTIC MISSILE TEST. ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA--------------- PRESIDENT ROH, THE HEIR OF KIM DAE-JUNG'-----S SUNSHINE POLICY---------------, HAS PUT THE SOUTH KOREAN ARMY ON ITS HIGHEST ALERT SINCE 1996, FOR--------------- FEAR OF NORTH KOREAN PROVOCATIONS DURING THE IRAQ WAR. AFTER MAJOR--------------- DIPLOMATIC BREAKTHROUGHS WITH SEOUL AND TOKYO OVER THE LAST FEW--------------- YEARS, KIM JONG IL IS LOSING HIS NEW FRIENDS FAST.---------------------------------------- WASHINGTON RECENTLY SURPRISED WITH SIGNALS THAT IT IS CONSIDERING--------------- WITHDRAWING ITS TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA. THE PYONGYANG PROPAGANDA--------------- MACHINE WAS PROBABLY ALREADY PREPARING VICTORY STATEMENTS AFTER--------------- 50 YEARS OF ANTI-IMPERIALIST STRUGGLE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, BUT--------------- QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY THE NEW SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT STATED THAT THE--------------- US TROOPS SHOULD REMAIN NEAR THE DMZ AS A TRIPWIRE. SO MUCH FOR--------------- KOREAN RECONCILIATION AND THE COMPATRIOTIC FEELINGS THAT HAD BEEN--------------- WARMING SINCE THE KIM-KIM SUMMIT IN JUNE------ AFTER 3 YEARS OF--------------- SUNSHINE AND SOME SLOW PROGRESS ON INTER-KOREAN PROJECTS THE RELATIONS--------------- ACROSS THE DMZ ARE QUICKLY COOLING AGAIN. THE HISTORIC OVERLAND--------------- ROUTE TO THE NORTH'-----S MT KUMGANG RESORT CROSSING THE DMZ FOR--------------- THE FIRST TIME IN 50 YEARS WAS-A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH-IN FEBRUARY---------------, BUT ONLY OPERATED FOR 2 WEEKS. THE RAILWAY LINES THAT COULD LINK--------------- SOUTH KOREA TO CHINA AND RUSSIA ARE STILL NOT RECONNECTED. THEY--------------- CAN NOT EVEN AGREE ON THE SIZE ON THE BUILDING FOR FAMILY REUNIONS--------------- IN MT KUMGANG. PYONGYANG AND SEOUL HAVE ALLOWED THEIR WORKERS, WOMEN---------------, ATHLETES, FAMILIES TO MEET EACH OTHER, SHARE THEIR SADNESS ABOUT--------------- THE NATIONAL DIVISION, AND ISSUE NATIONALIST STATEMENTS CALLING--------------- FOR REUNIFICATION; NEVERTHELESS ON A HIGHER LEVEL TRUST REMAINS--------------- THIN. THE NEW ROH GOVERNMENT IS ASKING THE US TROOPS TO STAY, MEANING--------------- THAT SEOUL DESPITE ALL THE SUNSHINE CONTINUES TO FEEL THREATENED--------------- BY KIM JONG IL. ROH HAS ALSO ADOPTED THE BUSH LINE OF ADVOCATING--------------- A MULTILATERAL SETTING TO SOLVE THE NUCLEAR CRISIS. AT THEIR PLANNED--------------- MEETING NEXT MONTH IN WASHINGTON, THEY WILL ALIGN THEIR POLICIES--------------- FURTHER. THE ONLY MATTER THAT SEEMS TO DIVIDE THE LONG-TIME ALLIES--------------- IS URGENCY: THE SOUTH KOREAN ECONOMY IS STARTING TO FEEL THE EFFECTS--------------- OF DECREASING INVESTOR'-----S CONFIDENCE.----------------------------------------- PYONGYANG'-----S OTHER NEW FRIENDSHIP HAS PROVEN EVEN MORE SUPERFICIAL.--------------- AFTER THE KOIZUMI-KIM MEETING LAST SEPTEMBER IN PYONGYANG, JAPAN--------------- SEEMED READY TO START SERIOUS BUSINESS WITH NORTH KOREA. JAPAN IS--------------- ONE OF THE DPRK'-----S MAIN TRADING PARTNERS, OF ROUGHLY THE SAME--------------- SIZE AS INTER-KOREAN TRADE IN 2001 (AROUND US$400M). UNFORTUNATELY--------------- KOIZUMI MISCALCULATED THE DOMESTIC IMPACT OF THE ISSUE OF THE JAPANESE--------------- ABDUCTEES, AND THE DIPLOMATIC PROCESS DERAILED AFTER TOKYO REFUSED--------------- TO SEND THE ABDUCTEES BACK TO PYONGYANG. FOR PYONGYANG THE ISSUE--------------- REMAINS A JAPANESE APOLOGY AND FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR THE PAST--------------- COLONIAL RULE. HOWEVER, JAPAN IS PANICKING ABOUT NORTH KOREAN MISSILES---------------, AND THREATENS TO ABROGATE THE PYONGYANG DECLARATION IF THE NORTH--------------- WOULD TEST-FIRE A BALLISTIC MISSILE. PYONGYANG CLAIMS JAPAN IS VIOLATING--------------- THE DECLARATION WITH ITS PLANS TO LAUNCH A SPY SATELLITE AND ESTABLISH--------------- A MISSILE DEFENCE SYSTEM, AND THUS-RESERVES THE RIGHT TO RESUME--------------- BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTS IF JAPAN CARRIES ON WITH THESE----- `HOSTILE--------------- ACTS'-----. IN ITS ANTI-IMPERIALIST RHETORIC PYONGYANG HAS EVEN--------------- SUGGESTED THAT HARD-LINE ELEMENTS IN JAPAN ARE TRYING TO USE THE--------------- NORTH KOREAN MISSILE THREAT AS AN EXCUSE TO INVADE KOREA AGAIN.--------------- NEVERTHELESS THE JAPANESE DID MENTION THE IDEA OF PREEMPTIVE STRIKES--------------- IN CASE NORTH KOREA PREPARED TO LAUNCH A LONG-RANGE MISSILE, AND--------------- IT WILL SOON LAUNCH ITS SATELLITE WITH A JAPANESE BALLISTIC MISSILE.---------------------------------------- UNTIL SIX MONTHS AGO DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES WERE WELL UNDERWAY--------------- TO ESTABLISH A NEW REGIONAL STABILITY IN EAST ASIA LESS DEPENDENT--------------- ON THE US UMBRELLA. THE LOSS OF THESE TWO FRIENDS BRINGS PYONGYANG--------------- BACK TO SQUARE ONE, WITH SEOUL CONFIRMING ITS DEPENDENCE ON WASHINGTON---------------, AND JAPAN UNWILLING TO COME CLEAR WITH ITS COLONIAL PAST. THROUGHOUT--------------- THE NUCLEAR CRISIS PYONGYANG HAS BEEN CALLING JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA--------------- TO CONTINUE ON THE CONSTRUCTIVE PATH SET OUT IN THEIR BILATERAL--------------- DECLARATIONS, BUT PYONGYANG'-----S STANDOFF WITH WASHINGTON HAS--------------- SERIOUSLY HURT THE NEW FRIENDSHIPS. AS JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA ARE--------------- FALLING BACK INTO STEP WITH WASHINGTON, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BILATERAL--------------- TALKS AS REQUESTED BY PYONGYANG, AND THE MULTILATERAL APPROACH OF--------------- THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS FADING. PYONGYANG WILL GET ITS DIRECT--------------- TALKS WITH WASHINGTON, BUT ONLY WHEN THE SITUATION WILL HAVE ESCALATED--------------- FAR ENOUGH FOR SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN TO BE HIDING BEHIND THE US.--------------- THAT MOMENT MIGHT BE VERY NEAR, AS KIM JONG IL HAS NO REASON TO--------------- WAIT. TO HIS OWN FRUSTRATIONS HE HAS FAILED TO FIND A WAY TO PUT--------------- PRESSURE ON WASHINGTON WITHOUT HURTING HIS RELATIONS WITH SEOUL--------------- AND TOKYO. KIM JONG IL'-----S DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES MAY HAVE BEEN--------------- GENUINE, BUT HIS REPUTATION IS HAUNTING HIM.---------------------------------------------------------------------------- DO NOT FEAR, THEY TELL EACH--------------- OTHER------------------------- 18 MARCH-------------------------- 2003 WHAT AN INTRUIGING SITUATION; THE US AMBASSADOR IN SEOUL SAYS THAT--------------- THE DPRK HAS AN 'IRRATIONAL FEAR' OF THE US. ON THE OTHER SIDE---------------, A RECENT OFFICIAL NORTH KOREAN STATEMENT SAID IT WAS 'QUITE SENSELESS--------------- AND UNREASONABLE' FOR THE US TO INSIST THAT THE DPRK POSES A NUCLEAR--------------- THREAT TO THE US.-------------------- HOWEVER, THE EXISTENTIAL FEARS OF PYONGYANG SEEMED A LITTLE MORE--------------- JUSTIFIED WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH ANNOUNCED THE INVASION OF IRAQ, INCLUDING--------------- REGIME CHANGE. FOR ITS PART, PYONGYANG SHOULD NOT BE SECRETIVE ABOUT--------------- ITS ALLEGED NUCLEAR PROGRAM, LEAVING THE WORLD GUESSING ABOUT THE--------------- NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES.-------------------- THESE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SO MUCH STUFF TO TALK ABOUT; IF ONLY THEY--------------- WOULD SIT DOWN TOGETHER.--------------------------------------------------------- POSTPONING DIPLOMACY---------------------------------------- 14 MARCH--------------------------- 2003 FROM DIFFERENT SIDES AMERICANS ARE URGING PRESIDENT BUSH TO START--------------- NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. NOT ONLY DEMOCRATS AND ACADEMIC EXPERTS---------------, BUT ALSO CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS ARE TELLING THE ADMINISTRATION--------------- THAT REFUSING TO TALK WITH PYONGYANG CARRIES CONSIDERABLE RISKS.--------------- US ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES KELLY CLAIMS THAT NORTH KOREA--------------- WILL SOON BE ABLE TO PRODUCE NUCLEAR WEAPONS FROM ITS PLUTONIUM--------------- AND URANIUM ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, HIS BOSS SEEMS IN NO RUSH--------------- TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH PYONGYANG. ACCORDING TO THE CIA, NORTH--------------- KOREA HAS BEEN POSSESSING ONE OR TWO NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOR MANY YEARS--------------- ALREADY, AND INDEED A COUPLE MORE WOULD NOT CHANGE THAT SITUATION--------------- DRAMATICALLY.-------------------- CONSERVATIVE OPPONENTS OF THE CURRENT POLICY WANT THE ADMINISTRATION--------------- TO TALK WITH PYONGYANG, TO EXPLAIN KIM JONG IL THAT HE HAS TO DISMANTLE--------------- HIS PROGRAMS OR ELSE THE US WILL STRIKE. THE PROPOSED TALKS ARE--------------- VERY SHORT, AND BOUND TO FAIL BECAUSE NORTH KOREA WILL NOT GAIN--------------- ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL IN RETURN. IN FACT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION--------------- IS AIMING FOR A SIMILAR OUTCOME BY PUSHING FOR A UN SECURITY COUNCIL--------------- STATEMENT THAT WOULD CONDEMN NORTH KOREA'S NON-COMPLIANCE WITH ITS--------------- IAEA SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT. PYONGYANG WOULD LABEL SUCH A NARROW APPROACH--------------- TO THIS CRISIS AS UNFAIR-AND REJECT ANY UN INTERFERENCE. THE BUSH--------------- ADMINISTRATION WOULD THEN USE THIS AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE--------------- OF FORCE AGAINST NORTH KOREA. FOR THIS REASON CHINA IS AT PRESENT--------------- BLOCKING SUCH A STATEMENT BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL, AND URGING THE--------------- US TO HAVE DIRECT TALKS.------------------- ON THE OTHER SIDE, US KOREA EXPERTS ARE URGING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION--------------- TO ENGAGE IN A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE PYONGYANG--------------- REGIME. THESE TALKS WOULD INCLUDE THE DISMANTLING OF NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES---------------, RESUMED MISSILE NEGOTIATIONS, DISCUSSION ON A PEACE MECHANISM TO--------------- END THE KOREAN WAR AND REDUCE US TROOPS IN THE SOUTH, AND SUPPORT--------------- FOR THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NORTH KOREA. THIS IS PERFECTLY IN--------------- LINE WITH THE NORTH KOREAN STATEMENT THAT IT IS 'QUITE POSSIBLE--------------- TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR THE NUCLEAR ISSUE'. IT REMAINS A QUESTION--------------- WHETHER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WOULD CONSIDER A SOLUTION THAT DOES--------------- NOT LEAD TO ITS ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF REGIME CHANGE.------------------- PYONGYANG MUST HAVE HAD HIGH HOPES WHEN ROH MOO-HYUN TOOK OFFICE.--------------- SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT ROH SUPPORTS ENGAGEMENT AND HAS EXCLUDED--------------- ANY MILITARY ACTION AGAINST THE NORTH. HOWEVER, HIS GOVERNMENT IS--------------- MOVING CLOSER TO THE US POSITION OF FAVOURING MULTILATERAL TALKS---------------, AND SEES A CONTINUING ROLE FOR US TROOPS-IN THE SOUTH. THIS IS ANGERING--------------- THE NORTH AND IT HAS WARNED THAT INTER-KOREAN RELATIONS MIGHT GO--------------- BACK TO A STATE OF CONFRONTATION. SEOUL INTENDS TO WORK WITH THE--------------- US TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS, BUT THIS WILL TAKE TIME: PRESIDENT ROH'S--------------- VISIT TO WASHINGTON IS PLANNED FOR NEXT APRIL/MAY.------------------------------------- MEANWHILE THE ALIGNMENT OF THE SOUTH KOREAN AND US POSITIONS IS--------------- FURTHER RAISING MILITARY TENSIONS ON-THE KOREAN PENINSULA. BUSH'S--------------- TACTICAL MOVE TO INVOLVE THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL SEEMS STUCK, AND--------------- UNDER DOMESTIC PRESSURE, SOONER OR LATER THE US WILL TALK WITH NORTH--------------- KOREA AS POWELL HAS STATED. THE US ATTITUDE TOWARDS SUCH TALKS CAN--------------- EITHER BE CONSTRUCTIVE, OR THEY CAN BE SEEN AS A NECESSARY PRELUDE--------------- FOR ACTION. THREATENED BY-THE US MILITARY BUILDUP AND WAR GAMES----------------ACROSS THE DMZ, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT KIM WILL SIT BACK AND RELAX--------------- UNTIL ROH AND BUSH COME UP WITH A PLAN TO TALK IN SUMMER. EXPECT--------------- SOME FIREWORKS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- UN SECURITY COUNCIL'S TOUGH--------------- TASK------------------------- 25 FEB----------------------------- 2003 THIS ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED BY--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ASIA--------------- TIMES ONLINE---- ON 27 FEBRUARY 2003 IN THE SPEAKING FREELY SECTION.----------------------- ON FEBRUARY 19 THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL DECIDED TO REFER--------------- THE LETTER IT RECEIVED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY--------------- (IAEA) TO ITS EXPERTS FOR FURTHER CONSULTATIONS BEFORE STARTING--------------- THE DISCUSSION IN THE COUNCIL. THEREBY THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE--------------- NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR ISSUE IS A COMPLICATED MATTER, CONVENIENTLY--------------- OVERSIMPLIFIED BY THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS INTO PYONGYANG'S NON-COMPLIANCE--------------- WITH THE SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT. MEANWHILE PYONGYANG IS ARGUING THAT--------------- IT NO LONGER HAS ANY RELATIONS WITH THE IAEA AFTER IT WITHDREW FROM--------------- THE NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY (NPT) ON JANUARY 10, AND THAT THE AGENCY--------------- THEREFORE SHOULD NOT INTERVENE IN NORTH KOREA'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS.--------------- THIS CLAIM IS NOT GIVEN ANY ATTENTION IN INTERNATIONAL MEDIA, TO--------------- THE ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES, WHICH FAVORS MULTILATERAL TALKS--------------- TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS.-------------------- IN MARCH 1993, A YEAR AFTER SIGNING ITS SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT WITH--------------- THE IAEA, NORTH KOREA ANNOUNCED ITS WITHDRAWAL FROM THE NPT, GIVING--------------- THREE MONTHS' NOTICE. THE US PERSUADED PYONGYANG TO SUSPEND THIS--------------- WITHDRAWAL ONE DAY BEFORE IT WAS GOING TO BECOME EFFECTIVE, ON JUNE 11,--------------------- ONE YEAR LATER, IN JUNE 1994, NORTH KOREA WITHDREW ITS--------------- IAEA MEMBERSHIP. A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER THE NUCLEAR CRISIS CAME--------------- TO AN END WITH THE SIGNING OF THE AGREED FRAMEWORK, WHICH SPECIFIED--------------- THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD REMAIN PARTY TO THE NPT, AND THE IAEA WOULD--------------- BE ALLOWED TO MONITOR THE FREEZE OF CERTAIN FACILITIES. HOWEVER---------------, NORTH KOREA DID NOT REJOIN THE IAEA, AND THE AGREEMENT LINKED FULL--------------- COMPLIANCE WITH THE SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT TO THE COMPLETION OF TWO--------------- LIGHT-WATER REACTORS.-------------------- LAST MONTH NORTH KOREA ANNOUNCED IT WAS WITHDRAWING FROM THE NPT--------------- WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT, IN FACT ENDING THE SUSPENSION OF ITS WITHDRAWAL--------------- IN------ THUS NORTH KOREA JOINS INDIA, PAKISTAN, AND ISRAEL, THREE--------------- COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT SIGNATORIES TO THE NPT BUT CAN GET AWAY WITH--------------- THAT WITHOUT HAVING TO FEAR A REGIME CHANGE. MAYBE BECAUSE THEY--------------- ORGANIZE ELECTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME.-------------------- NORTH KOREA IS CERTAINLY IN BREACH OF THE AGREED FRAMEWORK, BECAUSE--------------- IT ENDED THE FREEZE OF THE NUCLEAR FACILITIES AT YONGBYON. HOWEVER---------------, THIS COMMITMENT WAS-PART OF A BILATERAL DEAL WITH THE UNITED STATES--------------- IN 1994 IN WHICH WASHINGTON AGREED-TO PROVIDE FORMAL ASSURANCES--------------- TO PYONGYANG AGAINST THE THREAT-OR USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS BY THE--------------- US, AND NORMALIZATION OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS. WHETHER--------------- THE IAEA HAD THE RIGHT TO DECLARE NORTH KOREA-IN BREACH OF THE SAFEGUARDS--------------- AGREEMENT, DISCONNECTING THE ENTIRE MATTER FROM THE AGREED FRAMEWORK--------------- AS WASHINGTON PREFERS, IS A MATTER THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD--------------- EXAMINE. PYONGYANG HAS STATED THAT IT DOES NOT OBJECT TO THE CRISIS--------------- BEING DISCUSSED IN THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, AS LONG AS THE ROLE--------------- OF THE UNITED STATES IS ALSO BROUGHT UP.-------------------- IAEA CHIEF MOHAMED ELBARADEI HAS SAID THE SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT--------------- REMAINS IN FORCE AND BINDING; NEVERTHELESS IT IS CLEAR THAT PYONGYANG--------------- HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION ON THIS, SO THE MATTER NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED--------------- AT LEAST. IT IS-NOT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY PYONGYANG CALLS----------------THE IAEA A----- "POLITICAL WAITING MAID OF THE US-----" AFTER ELBARADEI--------------- STARTED TO THROW AROUND-COMMENTS ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS NUCLEAR CRISIS---------------, CLEARLY OVERSTEPPING THE TECHNICAL ROLE OF HIS AGENCY.-------------------- THE FIRST TASK OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL WILL BE TO DETERMINE--------------- WHETHER THE IAEA-NORTH KOREA SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT IS STILL IN FORCE---------------, OR WHETHER THE IAEA'S SPECIFIC TASK IN NORTH KOREA WAS A COMPONENT--------------- OF THE BILATERAL AGREED FRAMEWORK. ONE HOPES THAT THE UN SECURITY--------------- COUNCIL WILL THUS SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER THE ROOT CAUSES--------------- OF THE CURRENT CRISIS, AND NOT ONLY FOCUS ON THE DPRK'S STRAINED--------------- RELATIONS WITH THE IAEA. WASHINGTON WILL TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF--------------- THE MULTILATERAL SETTING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO REDUCE THIS--------------- CRISIS TO A NON-PROLIFERATION ISSUE, IN ORDER TO ALIENATE PYONGYANG--------------- FURTHER AND HIDE ITS OWN AGREED FRAMEWORK COMMITMENTS UNDER A MULTILATERAL--------------- COVER.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OPPORTUNITY FOR THE--------------- UN SECURITY COUNCIL------------------------- 19 FEB-------------------------- 2003 THE FACT THAT THE DPRK NUCLEAR ISSUE IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSED IN--------------- THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL PRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL--------------- COMMUNITY TO URGE BOTH PARTIES TO THE AGREED FRAMEWORK TO COMPLY--------------- WITH THEIR OBLIGATIONS. A NUCLEAR-FREE KOREAN PENINSULA IS IN EVERYBODY'S--------------- INTEREST, AND THERE SEEMS TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT--------------- THE US SHOULD ALLOW BILATERAL TALKS WITH THE DPRK.-------------------- THE US HAS HINTED THAT IT WILL NOT ACCEPT A NEW FREEZE OF THE DPRK'S--------------- NUCLEAR FACILITIES, BUT INSTEAD WILL REQUIRE THEM TO BE DISMANTLED--------------- COMPLETELY. CERTAINLY THIS CAN-BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE DPRK IF IT CAN--------------- COUNT ON FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO REHABILITATE ITS ENERGY SECTOR, E.G.--------------- THROUGH INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.------------------- HOPEFULLY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL WILL SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO--------------- CONSIDER THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE CURRENT CRISIS, AND NOT JUST FOCUS--------------- ON THE NON-COMPLIANCE OF THE DPRK WITH THE IAEA SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT.--------------- IF IT FAILS TO EXAMINE THE DPRK VERSION OF THE EVENTS, IT IS NOT--------------- UNLIKELY THAT PYONGYANG WILL ACCUSE THE SECURITY-COUNCIL OF BEING--------------- A TOOL OF THE US, AND IT MIGHT BE RIGHT IN THAT CASE.----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AGREED--------------- FRAMEWORK------------------------- 16 DEC-------------------------- 2002 IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT THE DPRK NEVER SAW THE 1994 AGREED FRAMEWORK--------------- AS A SIMPLE PEACE-FOR-ENERGY DEAL, WHERE IT WOULD RECEIVE AN ENERGY--------------- PACKAGE IF IT AGREED TO STOP PRODUCING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE US SEEMS--------------- UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THE VIEW FROM PYONGYANG THAT IT SEES ITSELF--------------- THREATENED BY THE US, WITH ITS LARGE MILITARY PRESENCE IN SOUTH--------------- KOREA AND JAPAN. IN THE POST-COLD WAR ERA NUCLEAR DETERRENCE MAY--------------- SEEM OUT-DATED, BUT THE DPRK'S EFFORTS DO CORRESPOND WITH A REAL--------------- FEAR IN PYONGYANG OF BEING THE NEXT TARGET FOR A PRE-EMPTIVE US--------------- ATTACK OR REGIME CHANGE. RECEIVING MEMBERSHIP OF BUSH'S 'AXIS OF--------------- EVIL' IS NOT EXACTLY THE 'FORMAL ASSURANCE THAT IT WOULD NOT THREATEN--------------- OR USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AGAINST THE DPRK', AS THE US AGREED TO PROVIDE--------------- UNDER SECTION 3 OF THE AGREED FRAMEWORK.-------------------- EVEN THROUGH THE CURRENT CRISIS THE DPRK KEEPS CALLING FOR-A NON-AGGRESSION--------------- PACT WITH THE US. THE ENERGY DEAL CAN BE CONSIDERED A BY-PRODUCT--------------- OF THE 1994 NUCLEAR CRISIS; THE ESSENCE WAS THAT BOTH PARTIES AGREED--------------- ON HOW TO REMOVE MUTUAL SECURITY THREATS. IN THE CASE OF THE DPRK---------------, THAT WAS EASILY DONE BY FREEZING THE GRAPHITE-MODERATED REACTORS--------------- AND PUTTING THE FACILITIES UNDER IAEA SURVEILLANCE. BUT WHAT HAS--------------- THE US DONE IN RETURN TO REASSURE THE DPRK? WASHINGTON HAS BEEN--------------- RELUCTANT TO NORMALISE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL BILATERAL RELATIONS---------------, AS AGREED UNDER SECTION 2 OF THE AGREED FRAMEWORK, AND WHEN BUSH--------------- FINALLY SENT AN ENVOY TO PYONGYANG IT WAS-NOT FOR CONSTRUCTIVE-TALKS.------------------- AS FAR AS THE AGREED FRAMEWORK'S ENERGY DEAL GOES, THE-DPRK ALREADY--------------- FELT BETRAYED WITH THE DELAY OF THE COMPLETION OF TWO KEDO LIGHT--------------- WATER REACTORS BY-AT LEAST 5 YEARS. RECENTLY THE-US DECIDED TO SUSPEND--------------- HEAVY FUEL OIL DELIVERIES, AND THAT LEAVES THE DPRK NO CHOICE BUT--------------- TO REACTIVATE ITS REACTORS FROZEN UNDER THE AGREED FRAMEWORK, TO--------------- PRODUCE MUCH-NEEDED ELECTRICITY. AS NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS AROUND--------------- THE WORLD SHOW--IT IS POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE NUCLEAR ENERGY PEACEFULLY.--------------- THE DPRK HAS REPEATEDLY-STATED IT SEEKS A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE--------------- NUCLEAR ISSUE. THE IAEA COULD REINFORCE ITS MONITORING PROGRAMME--------------- TO MAKE SURE NO FUEL IS USED FOR MILITARY PURPOSES. IT SEEMS THE--------------- DPRK WOULD NOT REFUSE SUCH-INSPECTIONS IF THE US WOULD AGREE TO--------------- SIGN A NON-AGGRESSION TREATY AND FINALLY FINISH THE KOREAN WAR.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
