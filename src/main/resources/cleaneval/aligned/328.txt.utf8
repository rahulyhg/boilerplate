------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AN INTRODUCTION TO SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS PAGE LOOKS AT HOW THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN A LIQUID -OR A SOLID) AND ITS VAPOUR LEADS TO THE IDEA-OF A SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE.- IT ALSO LOOKS AT HOW SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE VARIES WITH TEMPERATURE, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE AND BOILING POINT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE ORIGIN OF SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE EVAPORATION OF A LIQUID------------ THE--- AVERAGE---- ENERGY OF THE PARTICLES IN A LIQUID IS GOVERNED BY THE TEMPERATURE.- THE HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE, THE HIGHER THE AVERAGE ENERGY.- BUT WITHIN THAT AVERAGE, SOME PARTICLES HAVE ENERGIES HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE, AND OTHERS HAVE ENERGIES LOWER THAN THE- AVERAGE.-------- SOME OF THE MORE ENERGETIC PARTICLES ON THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID CAN BE MOVING FAST ENOUGH TO ESCAPE FROM THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES HOLDING THE LIQUID TOGETHER.- THEY EVAPORATE.-------  THE DIAGRAM SHOWS A SMALL REGION OF A LIQUID NEAR ITS SURFACE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTICE THAT EVAPORATION ONLY TAKES PLACE ON THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID.- THAT'S QUITE DIFFERENT FROM BOILING WHICH HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS ENOUGH ENERGY TO DISRUPT THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES THROUGHOUT THE LIQUID.- THAT'S WHY, IF YOU LOOK AT BOILING WATER, YOU SEE BUBBLES OF GAS BEING FORMED ALL-THE WAY THROUGH THE LIQUID.-------- IF YOU LOOK AT WATER WHICH IS JUST EVAPORATING IN THE SUN, YOU DON'T SEE ANY BUBBLES.- WATER MOLECULES ARE SIMPLY BREAKING AWAY FROM THE SURFACE LAYER.-------- EVENTUALLY, THE WATER WILL ALL EVAPORATE IN THIS WAY.- THE ENERGY WHICH IS LOST AS THE PARTICLES EVAPORATE IS REPLACED FROM THE SURROUNDINGS.- AS THE MOLECULES IN-THE WATER JOSTLE WITH EACH OTHER- NEW MOLECULES WILL GAIN ENOUGH ENERGY TO ESCAPE FROM THE SURFACE.------------------------- THE EVAPORATION OF A LIQUID IN A CLOSED CONTAINER------------ NOW IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS IF THE LIQUID IS IN A CLOSED CONTAINER.- COMMON SENSE TELLS YOU THAT WATER IN A SEALED BOTTLE DOESN'T SEEM TO EVAPORATE - OR AT LEAST, IT DOESN'T-DISAPPEAR OVER TIME.---------BUT THERE--- IS---- CONSTANT EVAPORATION FROM THE SURFACE.- PARTICLES CONTINUE TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID- - BUT THIS TIME THEY ARE TRAPPED IN THE SPACE ABOVE THE LIQUID.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AS THE GASEOUS PARTICLES BOUNCE AROUND, SOME OF THEM WILL HIT THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID AGAIN, AND BE TRAPPED THERE.- THERE WILL RAPIDLY BE AN EQUILIBRIUM SET UP IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES LEAVING THE SURFACE IS EXACTLY BALANCED BY THE NUMBER REJOINING IT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN THIS EQUILIBRIUM, THERE WILL BE A FIXED NUMBER OF THE GASEOUS PARTICLES IN THE SPACE ABOVE THE LIQUID.-------- WHEN THESE PARTICLES HIT THE WALLS OF THE CONTAINER, THEY EXERT A PRESSURE.- THIS PRESSURE IS CALLED THE------ SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE-------- (ALSO KNOWN AS------ SATURATION VAPOUR PRESSURE--------) OF THE LIQUID.------------------------- MEASURING THE SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE------------ IT ISN'T DIFFICULT TO SHOW THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE (AND TO MEASURE IT) USING A SIMPLE PIECE OF APPARATUS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  NOTE:---------- THIS EXPERIMENT IS MUCH EASIER TO TALK ABOUT THAN DO, GIVEN THE SAFETY PROBLEMS IN HANDLING MERCURY BECAUSE OF ITS POISONOUS VAPOUR.- THIS IS PARTICULARLY GOING TO BE A PROBLEM IF YOU WANT TO FIND THE SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE OF A LIQUID AT A HIGHER TEMPERATURE.- YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE A MORE COMPLEX BIT OF APPARATUS.- THAT ISN'T A PROBLEM YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT FOR UK A LEVEL PURPOSES.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  IF YOU HAVE A MERCURY BAROMETER TUBE IN A TROUGH OF MERCURY, AT-1 ATMOSPHERE PRESSURE THE COLUMN WILL BE ----MM TALL.- 1 ATMOSPHERE IS SOMETIMES QUOTED AS 760 MMHG ("MILLIMETRES OF MERCURY").------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IF YOU SQUIRT A FEW DROPS OF LIQUID INTO THE TUBE, IT WILL RISE TO FORM A THIN LAYER FLOATING ON TOP OF THE MERCURY.- SOME OF THE LIQUID WILL EVAPORATE AND YOU WILL GET THE EQUILIBRIUM WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT - PROVIDED THERE IS STILL SOME LIQUID ON TOP OF THE MERCURY.- IT IS ONLY AN EQUILIBRIUM IF- BOTH LIQUID AND VAPOUR ARE PRESENT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE OF THE LIQUID WILL FORCE THE MERCURY LEVEL DOWN A BIT.--YOU CAN MEASURE THE DROP - AND THIS GIVES A VALUE FOR THE SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE OF THE LIQUID AT THIS TEMPERATURE.- IN THIS CASE, THE MERCURY HAS BEEN FORCED DOWN BY A DISTANCE OF 760 - 630 MM.- THE SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE OF THIS LIQUID-AT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE-EXPERIMENT IS 130 MMHG.-------- YOU COULD CONVERT THIS INTO PROPER SI UNITS (PASCALS) IF YOU WANTED TO.- 760 MMHG IS EQUIVALENT TO 10132--PA.-------- A- VALUE OF 130 MMHG IS QUITE A HIGH VAPOUR PRESSURE IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ROOM TEMPERATURE.- WATER'S SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE IS ABOUT 20 MMHG AT THIS TEMPERATURE.- A HIGH VAPOUR PRESSURE MEANS THAT THE LIQUID MUST BE VOLATILE --MOLECULES-ESCAPE FROM ITS SURFACE RELATIVELY EASILY--AND AREN'T VERY GOOD AT STICKING BACK ON AGAIN EITHER.-------- THAT WILL RESULT IN LARGER NUMBERS OF THEM IN THE GAS STATE ONCE EQUILIBRIUM IS REACHED.-------  THE LIQUID IN THE EXAMPLE MUST HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER INTERMOLECULAR- FORCES THAN WATER.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE VARIATION OF SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE WITH TEMPERATURE------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN LIQUID AND VAPOUR------------ YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS IN TWO WAYS.-------- THERE IS A COMMON SENSE WAY.- IF YOU INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE, YOU ARE INCREASING THE AVERAGE ENERGY OF THE PARTICLES PRESENT.- THAT MEANS THAT MORE-OF THEM ARE LIKELY TO HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO ESCAPE FROM THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID.- THAT WILL TEND TO INCREASE THE SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE.-------- OR YOU CAN LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF LE CHATELIER'S PRINCIPLE - WHICH WORKS JUST AS WELL IN THIS KIND OF PHYSICAL SITUATION AS IT DOES IN THE MORE FAMILIAR CHEMICAL EXAMPLES.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  NOTE:---------- YOU COULD FOLLOW THIS LINK IF YOU AREN'T SURE ABOUT--------------------------------------------- LE CHATELIER'S PRINCIPLE----.-------- USE THE BACK BUTTON ON YOUR BROWSER TO RETURN TO THIS PAGE LATER.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  WHEN THE SPACE ABOVE THE LIQUID IS SATURATED WITH VAPOUR PARTICLES--YOU HAVE THIS EQUILIBRIUM OCCURRING ON-THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FORWARD CHANGE (LIQUID TO VAPOUR) IS ENDOTHERMIC.--IT NEEDS HEAT TO CONVERT THE LIQUID INTO THE VAPOUR.-------- ACCORDING TO LE CHATELIER, INCREASING THE TEMPERATURE OF A SYSTEM IN A DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM FAVOURS THE ENDOTHERMIC CHANGE.- THAT MEANS THAT INCREASING THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF VAPOUR PRESENT, AND SO INCREASES THE SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE.------------------------- THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE OF WATER------------ THE GRAPH SHOWS HOW THE SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE (SVP) OF WATER VARIES FROM---- 0 C TO---- 100  C.- THE PRESSURE SCALE (THE VERTICAL ONE) IS- MEASURED IN KILOPASCALS- (KPA).- 1 ATMOSPHERE PRESSURE IS 101.325 KPA.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE AND BOILING POINT------------ A LIQUID BOILS WHEN ITS SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE BECOMES EQUAL TO THE EXTERNAL PRESSURE ON THE LIQUID.- WHEN THAT HAPPENS, IT ENABLES BUBBLES OF VAPOUR TO FORM THROUGHOUT THE LIQUID - THOSE ARE THE BUBBLES YOU SEE WHEN A LIQUID BOILS.-------- IF THE EXTERNAL PRESSURE IS HIGHER-THAN THE SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE, THESE BUBBLES ARE PREVENTED FROM FORMING, AND YOU JUST GET EVAPORATION AT THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID.-------- IF THE LIQUID IS IN AN OPEN CONTAINER AND EXPOSED TO NORMAL ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, THE LIQUID BOILS WHEN ITS SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE BECOMES EQUAL TO 1 ATMOSPHERE (OR 101325 PA OR 101.325 KPA OR 760 MMHG).- THIS HAPPENS WITH WATER WHEN THE TEMPERATURE REACHES---- 100 C.-------- BUT AT DIFFERENT PRESSURES, WATER WILL BOIL AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES.- FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE TOP OF MOUNT EVEREST THE PRESSURE IS SO LOW THAT WATER WILL BOIL AT ABOUT---- 70 C.- DEPRESSIONS FROM THE ATLANTIC CAN EASILY LOWER THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE IN THE UK ENOUGH SO THAT WATER WILL BOIL AT---- 99 C - EVEN LOWER WITH VERY DEEP DEPRESSIONS.-------- WHENEVER WE JUST TALK ABOUT----- "THE BOILING POINT-----" OF A LIQUID, WE ALWAYS ASSUME THAT IT-IS BEING MEASURED AT EXACTLY 1 ATMOSPHERE PRESSURE.- IN PRACTICE, OF COURSE, THAT IS RARELY EXACTLY TRUE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE AND SOLIDS------------------------------------------------------------------------------ SUBLIMATION------------ SOLIDS CAN ALSO LOSE PARTICLES FROM THEIR SURFACE TO FORM A VAPOUR, EXCEPT THAT IN THIS CASE WE CALL THE EFFECT------ SUBLIMATION-------- RATHER THAN EVAPORATION.- SUBLIMATION IS THE DIRECT CHANGE FROM SOLID TO VAPOUR (OR VICE VERSA) WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE LIQUID STAGE.-------- IN MOST CASES, AT ORDINARY TEMPERATURES, THE SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURES OF SOLIDS RANGE FROM LOW TO VERY, VERY, VERY LOW.- THE FORCES OF ATTRACTION IN MANY SOLIDS ARE TOO HIGH TO ALLOW MUCH LOSS OF PARTICLES FROM THE SURFACE.-------- HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME WHICH DO EASILY FORM VAPOURS.- FOR EXAMPLE, NAPHTHALENE (USED IN OLD-FASHIONED----- "MOTH BALLS-----" TO DETER CLOTHES MOTHS) HAS QUITE A STRONG SMELL.- MOLECULES MUST BE BREAKING AWAY FROM THE SURFACE AS A VAPOUR, BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SMELL IT.-------- ANOTHER FAIRLY COMMON EXAMPLE (DISCUSSED IN DETAIL ON ANOTHER PAGE) IS SOLID CARBON DIOXIDE----- - "DRY ICE-----".- THIS NEVER FORMS A LIQUID AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AND ALWAYS CONVERTS DIRECTLY FROM SOLID TO VAPOUR.- THAT'S WHY IT IS KNOWN AS--- DRY---- ICE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  NOTE:---------- THIS LINK WILL TAKE YOU STRAIGHT TO THE PAGE ABOUT------------------------------ PHASE DIAGRAMS---- WHERE THIS IS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL.- FOLLOW THIS LINK AS WELL IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE LOGICAL NEXT STEP IN THIS TOPIC WHICH IS A DISCUSSION OF THE PHASE DIAGRAMS OF PURE SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING WATER AND CARBON DIOXIDE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
