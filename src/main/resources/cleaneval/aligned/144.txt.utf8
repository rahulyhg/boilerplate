WILD ROSE) MYSELF.------------------------- --EDITOR (JULY/27/1999)---------------- I'M AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE LANDSCAPER AND LANDSCAPE DESIGNER WITH A-GOOD DEAL OF EXPERIENCE IN ELIMINATING POISON IVY FROM THE LANDSCAPE. AND-,LITTLE AS I LIKE THE PROSPECT OF USING AN HERBICIDE, OUT OF CONSIDERATIONS-BOTH FOR MY PERSONAL HEALTH AND FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, THE ONLY WAY I'VE FOUND-TO GET RID OF SUBSTANTIAL COLONIES OF POISON IVY IS BY THE CAREFUL AND-RESPONSIBLE USE OF HERBICIDE.---- YOU CAN REMOVE A SINGLE YOUNG PLANT OR TWO BY GRASPING IT THROUGH A PLASTIC-GARBAGE BAG AND PULLING IT UP ROOT AND ALL. TURN THE BAG INSIDE-OUT OVER THE-PLANT, AND IT'S DONE. (YOU MAY HAVE SOME GROWTH RETURN FROM BROKEN ROOTS-,BUT CAN GET RID OF THEM IN THE SAME WAY.)------- GLYPHOSATE------THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN ROUNDUP AND RODEO--IS SOMETIMES-RECOMMENDED FOR KILLING POISON IVY. BECAUSE ITS ACTIVE INGREDIENT BREAKS-DOWN QUICKLY, I INITIALLY TRIED TO USE ROUND-UP, BUT FOUND THAT PLANTS COULD-RECOVER FROM AS MANY AS SIX APPLICATIONS OVER TWO YEARS. OTHERS WITH WHOM-I'VE COMPARED NOTES ALSO DESCRIBE SIMILAR EXPERIENCES. I'VE ONLY USED THE-PRODUCT AS SOLD, WITH GLYPHOSATE.---- THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMS TO WORK, IN MY EXPERIENCE, IS A HERBICIDE-CONTAINING--- TRICLOPYR----. I'VE USED ORTHO BRUSH-B-GON WITH A GREAT DEAL OF-SUCCESS. IF I'M CAREFUL, I FIND I CAN SPOT-TREAT INDIVIDUAL PLANTS WITHOUT-DOING MUCH DAMAGE TO WHAT'S GROWING AROUND THEM. FOR GREATER ACCURACY-,INSTEAD OF SPRAYING YOU CAN PAINT THE HERBICIDE DIRECTLY ON THE LEAVES.----- I HATE TO SOUND LIKE A SPOKESPERSON FOR MONSANTO. THIS COMPANY HAS MANY SINS-TO ANSWER FOR. AND, AS I'VE SAID ABOVE, I'M RELUCTANT TO USE HERBICIDES. BUT-THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES THE JOB.---- USE IT WITH RESPECT. READ THE LABEL AND FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS RELIGIOUSLY.-WAIT FOR A DAY WHEN THE WINDS ARE STILL. DON'T USE IT IN OR WITHIN TEN FEET-OF A WETLAND. USE RUBBER GLOVES, AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO BREATHE THE SPRAY.-WASH UP THOROUGHLY AFTERWARDS, AND PUT YOUR CLOTHES IN THE WASH RIGHT AWAY.------- I STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST USING SALT TO KILL PLANTS----. YES, WE USE SALT IN-OUR FOOD. BUT IN THE ENVIRONMENT, IN THE QUANTITIES REQUIRED, IT'S TOXIC AND-PERSISTENT--MUCH MORE SO THAN ROUNDUP OR BRUSH-B-GON. IT DOES NOT BREAK-DOWN, AND WILL CONTINUE TO KILL ANYTHING PLANTED ON THE SPOT UNTIL IT'S-THOROUGHLY LEACHED AWAY--A MATTER OF YEARS EVEN IN REGIONS OF HIGH RAINFALL.-AND EVEN THEN, IT CONTINUES TO BE A HAZARD, AS IT LEACHES INTO THE-GROUNDWATER. USING IT IS MUCH MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY DAMAGING THAN USING-HERBICIDES WHOSE SALE FOR THE PURPOSE IS ALLOWED BY THE EPA.-------- --DON GALBREATH---------------------------------- SUBMITTED 23/DEC------------/2000 EDITOR:----- THANKS DON FOR AN EXCELLENT DISCUSSION-!
