COHEN--------------------  CHAIRMAN AND CEO-------------  THE COHEN GROUP-------------  (FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE)---------------------------------  MARCH 6,----------------------------------------- 2001  "THAT'S---------- THE FIRST INTRODUCTION I'VE HAD WITH MUSIC ACCOMPANIMENT, BUT THANK---------- YOU, JIM, VERY MUCH FOR THE INTRODUCTION. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR---------- EXAGGERATIONS IN TERMS OF MY CAREER BUT I RELISH EVERY DESCRIPTION YOU---------- GAVE.---------------------  "I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DEPART HERE IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES AND GO---------- TO CAPITOL HILL WHERE YOU WILL BE ENTERTAINED AND SPOKEN TO BY AMONG---------- OTHERS SENATOR WARNER. SENATOR WARNER IS MY SENIOR BY ONE DAY IN THE---------- UNITED STATES SENATE, AND YOU MIGHT ASK HIM HOW THAT OCCURRED AS A---------- MATTER OF CONVERSATION.---------------------  "BUT HE IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. HE ALSO---------- IS THE SPONSOR AND THE CREATOR OF A NEW SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE SENATE---------- ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE CALLED EMERGING THREATS AND CAPABILITIES. HE---------- ALSO SPONSORED A SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM-TO ENCOURAGE MORE STUDENTS TO---------- BECOME INFORMATION SECURITY SPECIALISTS. SO HE HAS PLAYED A CRITICALLY---------- IMPORTANT ROLE IN A FIELD IN WHICH YOU ARE DEEPLY ENGAGED.---------------------  "I WILL BE BRIEF BECAUSE THE BUSES I AM TOLD WILL NOT LEAVE BEFORE I---------- FINISH BUT I WANT-THEM TO LEAVE REASONABLY ON TIME.---------------------  "YOU WERE ADDRESSED I BELIEVE EARLIER THIS MORNING, OR AFTERNOON, YOU---------- HEARD FROM CONGRESSMAN DAVE MCCURDY, SENATOR BOB BENNETT AND MIKE---------- VATIS ABOUT GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF SECURITY. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A---------- LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TACK HERE TODAY, THIS AFTERNOON, AND TALK ABOUT A---------- DIFFERENT ASPECT OF NATIONAL SECURITY.------------------------IT SEEMS TO ME THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY COVER STORY THAT I SEE ABOUT IT IN---------- RECENT MAGAZINES HAS BEEN ABOUT SECURITY. THE GOOD NEWS IS-IT'S---------- HELPING TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS AND CORPORATE AWARENESS ABOUT THE---------- ISSUE OF PROTECTING SECURE INFORMATION. THE BAD NEWS, I THINK, IS THAT---------- YOU'RE BASICALLY SEEING WHAT I WOULD CALL OFF BROADWAY PRODUCTIONS---------- WHEN THE REAL SHOW WAS TAKING PLACE IN TIMES SQUARE ITSELF.---------------------  "THE MEDIA ATTENTION IS FOCUSED UPON TEENAGERS WHO ARE DEFACING---------- WEBSITES, LAUNCHING DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS OR JUVENILE---------- EXTORTIONISTS WHO STEAL AND THREATEN TO POST CREDIT CARD NUMBERS.---------- THESE ARE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH VERY LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY ATTACHED---------- TO THEM, BUT THE THREAT TO PRIVACY AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION IS---------- ABOUT TO EXPLODE IN A WORLD THAT MANY OF YOU ARE DESIGNING AND-----------BUILDING AND ONE IN WHICH THE CAPABILITIES ARE EMBEDDED INTO DEVICES---------- ALL AROUND US AND SOON EVEN WITHIN US. THESE DEVICES ARE---------- INTERCONNECTED TO A NETWORK THAT SPANS THE GLOBE. IF JOHN CHAMBERS---------- WERE HERE, HE WOULD DESCRIBE THIS AS THE VIRTUAL GLOBAL ECOSYSTEM.---------------------  "NOW, HACKERS AND CRACKERS, THEY ARE MERE NUISANCES COMPARED TO ANOTHER---------- GROWING THREAT THAT I'VE TRIED TO FOCUS ON AND ONE I WANT TO DISCUSS---------- WITH YOU TODAY, AND THAT IS THE CONVERGENCE OF THE-WORLD'S SECOND---------- OLDEST PROFESSION WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR---------- THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. CORPORATE ESPIONAGE HAS ALWAYS BEEN, OR AT---------- LEAST IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, A CONCERN FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY----------, BECAUSE WHILE THE AVERAGE COST OF A HACKING ATTACK OR DENIAL OF---------- SERVICE IS SAID TO BE ROUGHLY $150,000 IN TERMS OF THE COSTS TO A---------- COMPANY, ACCORDING TO THE FBI THE AVERAGE LOSS OF A CORPORATE---------- ESPIONAGE INCIDENT IS MUCH LARGER.---------------------  "THERE IS A SURVEY THAT WAS CONDUCTED IN 1999 BY ASIS, THE AMERICAN---------- SOCIETY FOR INDUSTRIAL SECURITY, AND OVER HALF OF THE MANUFACTURERS---------- WHO WERE SURVEYED REPORTED BEING A VICTIM THAT YEAR WITH AN AVERAGE---------- LOSS OF $50 MILLION PER INCIDENT. NEARLY HALF OF THE COMPANIES---------- SURVEYED WERE, THEY DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AS HIGH TECH FIRMS AND THEY---------- REPORTED THESE INCIDENTS, AND WHILE THEY LOST ONLY A HALF A MILLION---------- DOLLARS PER INCIDENT WHERE THE LOSS COULD BE VALUED, THEY WERE---------- SUCCESSFULLY TARGETED MORE-THAN 60 TIMES DURING-THE COURSE OF THE---------- YEAR. SO YOU CAN SEE THIS CAN ADD UP TO MANY TENS OF MILLIONS OF---------- DOLLARS.---------------------  "DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE HEAVY FOCUS IS ON-INTERNET HACKING AS SUCH----------, THE INCIDENT FOR CORPORATE SPYING IS ROUGHLY THE SAME. YOU HAVE---------- ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF ATTACKS-ON THE PENETRATION ATTEMPTS FOR---------- CORPORATE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AS YOU DO FOR DENIAL OF SERVICE---------- ATTACKS. AND SO OTHERS HAVE NOW INDICATED THAT OVER A THIRD OF U.S.---------- COMPANIES ARE NOW THE TARGET OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE WITH THE NUMBERS---------- THAT ARE QUADRUPLING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST DECADE EVERY---------- YEAR, AND THERE IS NO END IN SIGHT.---------------------  "I MENTION THIS BECAUSE IN SPITE OF THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN PASSED----------, I HELPED TO AUTHOR AN ACT CALLED THE 1996 ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE ACT ALONG---------- WITH SENATOR SPECTER, MAKING IT A CRIME TO ENGAGE IN SUCH ACTIVITY.---------- BUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THOSE CORPORATE ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES ARE---------- ACTUALLY SPONSORED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.---------------------  "I THINK IT IS SOMEWHAT OF A PARADOX THAT STATE-SPONSORED ESPIONAGE HAS---------- BECOME EVEN GREATER AT THE END OF THE COLD WAR THAN IT WAS DURING. IN---------- FACT, A NUMBER OF THESE ESPIONAGE APPARATUSES,-APPARATI I GUESS IT---------- WOULD BE CALLED NOW, WERE REDIRECTED TO SPY ON BEHALF OF THE---------- BUSINESSES IN THEIR COUNTRY.---------------------  "I AM NOT TALKING TO YOU NOW-AS A FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE BUT---------- CALLING UPON MY EXPERIENCE OF A TOTAL OF 24 YEARS ON CAPITOL HILL AND---------- DRAW UPON THE STATEMENTS THAT I MADE AT THAT TIME. IT WAS NEARLY A---------- DECADE AGO WHEN BORIS YELTSIN GAVE A VERY HISTORIC SPEECH ON THE FLOOR---------- OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO A JOINT SESSION OF---------- CONGRESS, AND YOU MAY RECALL THIS. HE SAID, 'NO MORE LIES.'---------- I THINK BECAUSE OF THE THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE THAT HE RECEIVED PEOPLE---------- THOUGHT HE SAID, 'NO MORE SPIES.' AND YET WE KNOW FROM---------- RECENT EVENTS AND RECENT REVELATIONS, THAT CLEARLY IS NOT THE CASE.---------------------  "THE POINT IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS ALL ALONG. IF ANYONE GOT---------- THE IMPRESSION AT THE END OF THE COLD WAR THAT THAT MEANT THAT THERE---------- IS NO ONE LEFT TO COME IN FROM THE COLD, THEN THEY DIDN'T GET THAT---------- IMPRESSION FROM MOSCOW BECAUSE AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE BERLIN WALL----------, THE HEAD OF THE KGB VLADIMIR KARYOSHKOV[?], HE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT---------- HIS AGENTS WOULD BE BUSIER THAN EVER WITH AN ENHANCED FOCUS ON---------- INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE.---------------------  "THE KGB IS FAR FROM BEING ALONE IN THIS REGARD. NOT LONG AFTER THE---------- DIRECTOR OF THE KGB MADE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT PIERRE MARION[?], THE FORMER---------- DIRECTOR OF FRENCH INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, PUBLICLY ADMITTED THAT HE---------- DIRECTED THE INTELLIGENCE FORCES OF FRANCE TO SECRETLY COLLECT AND---------- PASS ON TO FRENCH COMPANIES INFORMATION THEY WERE ABLE TO SECURE FROM---------- THEIR COMPETITORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE.---------------------  "AND OUR FRIENDS IN THE FRENCH INTELLIGENCE SERVICE PROVIDE A FULL---------- RANGE OF SERVICES. AMONG THOSE THAT ARE MOST WIDELY PUBLICIZED ARE---------- CASES IN WHICH THEY STOLE PROPRIETARY TECHNICAL DATA FROM A U.S.---------- COMPUTER MANUFACTURER AND THEN PROVIDED IT TO A FRENCH COMPETITOR.---------------------  "ANOTHER CASE IN WHICH WE HAD A FRENCH NATIONAL WORKING FOR A U.S.---------- FIBER OPTICS COMPANY SOLD TRADE SECRETS TO THE FRENCH INTELLIGENCE----------, WHICH THEN IN TURN PASSED IT ON TO THE FRENCH COMPETITOR. AND IN THE---------- CASE THAT MONSIEUR MARION WAS PARTICULARLY PROUD OF, THE FRENCH---------- INTELLIGENCE ACQUIRED THE PRICING PROPOSAL FROM A U.S. AIRCRAFT---------- MANUFACTURER, WHICH ENABLED ITS FRENCH RIVAL TO UNDERBID IT IN A---------- BILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT.---------------------  "IN SHORT, THE ESPIONAGE THREAT IS NO LONGER SOLELY FOCUSED ON STATE---------- SECRETS. IT'S PRIMARILY TARGETED AGAINST TRADE SECRETS. AND THE THREAT---------- COMES NOT FROM JUST OUR ADVERSARIES, BUT IRONICALLY ENOUGH FROM OUR---------- ALLIES. AND WHILE THE THREAT TO THE TECHNOLOGY IS REAL, THEY DON'T---------- HAVE TO STEAL THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF. IN FACT, IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT---------- FOR THEM TO WORK WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT'S STOLEN. WHAT THEY REALLY WANT---------- IS THE INFORMATION ON WHICH YOU PRICE YOUR PRODUCT, AND THEY WANT TO---------- BE ABLE TO UNDERBID YOU AND THEN OFFER IT TO THEIR COMPETING FIRMS.---------------------  "NOW, SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE AWARE THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR THE---------- EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT I SHOULD SAY, IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING AN INQUIRY---------- AS TO WHETHER THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IS PROVIDING INFORMATION TO---------- AMERICAN BUSINESSES. LET ME SAY THAT THE ALLEGATION IS FALSE. IT IS---------- UNFOUNDED. U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES DO NOT, THEY CANNOT AND THEY---------- WILL NOT STEAL INFORMATION FROM FOREIGN COMPANIES TO BENEFIT U.S.---------- COMPANIES, AND THERE ARE MANY PRACTICAL REASONS WHY THIS IS THE CASE.---------- WE CANNOT DO SO, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY U.S. OFFICIALS ACROSS A NUMBER---------- OF ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE THAT WE---------- WOULD NEVER DO SO.---------------------  "CORPORATE ESPIONAGE AND EVEN CORPORATE ESPIONAGE CONDUCTED BY FOREIGN---------- GOVERNMENTS, THEIR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES IS NOTHING NEW. THE POINT I---------- WANT TO MAKE TODAY IS IT IS INTENSIFYING AT EVER GROWING RATES, AND---------- WHAT IS MAKING IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR US IS THAT WE ARE BECOMING---------- INCREASINGLY MORE VULNERABLE BECAUSE MOST OF THE COMPANIES THAT YOU---------- REPRESENT YOU ARE ADOPTING INFORMATION BASED SYSTEMS TO MANAGE---------- RESEARCH, DESIGN, PRODUCTION, FINANCES, CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND AS---------- COMPANIES HAVE ADOPTED NEW BUSINESS MODELS AND NEW TECHNOLOGY, THEY---------- HAVE ALSO CREATED NEW VULNERABILITIES. LET ME GIVE YOU JUST A FEW---------- EXAMPLES.---------------------  "WHAT IS A CODE WORD THAT CONSTANTLY IS INVOKED IF YOU'RE TRYING TO---------- STREAMLINE, GET MORE EFFICIENT, DOWNSIZE? YOU OUTSOURCE. WE DID A GOOD---------- DEAL OF THIS IN THE PENTAGON ITSELF, BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING---------- ACCELERATIVE MOVE ON THE PART OF BUSINESSES TO OUTSOURCE ANYTHING---------- THAT'S NOT REGARDED AS A CORE COMPETENCY IN ACTIVITIES THAT WERE DONE---------- IN-HOUSE FROM THE BACK OFFICE FUNCTIONS TO LOGISTICS TO PRODUCTION----------, AND A COMPANY WILL OFTEN GIVE ITS SUPPLIER PRIVILEGED ACCESS TO---------- FACILITIES AND INCREASINGLY TO ITS NETWORK SO THEY CAN BECOME AN---------- EFFECTIVE MEMBER OF THE TEAM. BUT THE SUPPLIERS ARE ALSO---------- ELECTRONICALLY NETWORKED IN WAYS THAT YOU HAVE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF.---------- THEY THEMSELVES FACE PRESSURES OF OUTSOURCING SOME OF THEIR NON-CORE---------- COMPETENCIES. AND SO YOU HAVE A SERIES OF A CHAIN OF TRUST BEING---------- DELEGATED-TO RELATIONSHIPS UPON RELATIONSHIPS UNTIL YOU FINALLY HAVE---------- COMPLETE STRANGERS WHO ARE INTERCONNECTED TO YOUR INNERMOST WORKING---------- DATABASES.---------------------  "OUTSOURCING OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTION I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR IS GROWING---------- EVERY YEAR THAT SOFTWARE PRODUCTION IS BEING OUTSOURCED OVERSEAS. AND---------- WE THINK OF THE THREE I'S. INDIA, IRELAND AND ISRAEL ARE THE MOST---------- OBVIOUS EXAMPLES. BUT THE PHENOMENON-IS GLOBAL. YOU CAN HIRE ONLINE A-----------PROGRAMMER IN PAKISTAN WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE, THREE YEARS OF PROGRAM---------- EXPERIENCE FOR ROUGHLY $1,200 A MONTH, AND ONE THAT HAS 12 YEARS OF---------- EXPERIENCE FOR ABOUT TWICE THAT MUCH.---------------------  "THIS CREATION OF THE GLOBAL LABOR FORCE IS A GREAT BOON TO OUR---------- INDUSTRIES, AND IT'S ALSO HELPING DEVELOP ECONOMIC SITUATIONS AROUND---------- THE WORLD.-BUT IT ALSO CREATES UNPRECEDENTED VULNERABILITIES.---------------------  "ANOTHER THING IS TAKING PLACE, CONSOLIDATION. HOW MANY OF YOU IN THE---------- AUDIENCE ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO INCREASINGLY CONSOLIDATE, TO MERGE WITH---------- VARIOUS COMPANIES? THOSE WHO SURVIVE THIS CONSOLIDATION ARE NOT REALLY---------- FOCUSED ON THE NETWORKING SYSTEMS OF EMERGING PARTNERS. THEY ARE NOT---------- WORRYING ENOUGH ABOUT THE IN-LAWS THAT THEY ARE MARRYING UP WITH. AND---------- WHETHER YOU MERGE OR ACQUIRE A COMPANY, YOU TAKE ON BOARD THOSE---------- EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUTSOURCING SUPPLIERS AND AGREEMENTS THAT---------- COVER THAT RELATIONSHIP NO MATTER HOW INADEQUATE.---------------------  "AS YOU ALL KNOW COMPUTING CAPABILITY IS BEING EMBEDDED IN DEVICES ALL---------- AROUND US. IN COPIERS, COFFEE POTS, CARS, CLOTHING, EVEN IN OUR---------- BODIES. THESE EMBEDDED DEVICES ARE NOW BEING INTERCONNECTED WITH OUR---------- OFFICES. THEY OPERATE OUR FACTORIES. THEY TIE OUR SUPPLIERS AND---------- INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS, AND THEY REACH AROUND THE GLOBE.---------------------  "I WANT TO SAY THIS AFTERNOON THAT PROMISCUITY IN THE CYBER REALM IS---------- EQUALLY DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH AND PRESENTS THE SAME RISKS AS---------- PROMISCUITY IN THE PHYSICAL REALM. EVERY ONE OF YOUR PARTNERS HAS HIS---------- OWN SET OF PARTNERS WHO IN TURN HAVE-THEIR OWN PARTNERS, AND YOU ARE---------- EFFECTIVELY SLEEPING WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE-OF THEM. THE RESULT CAN BE---------- A CONTAGION OF WHAT I WOULD CALL STD, SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGY---------- DISTRIBUTION, FOR WHICH THERE MAY BE NO CURE. DRUG COMPANIES CAN REST---------- ASSURED THAT THERE IS NO PATENT TO BE INFRINGED UPON HERE.---------------------  "A DECADE AGO, I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES, A DECADE AGO THERE WAS A---------- GOOD DEAL OF ATTENTION FOCUSED ON A DALLAS COMPUTER MAKER THAT HE---------- LEARNED THAT HIS PRICING INFORMATION SOMEHOW HAD GOTTEN INTO THE HANDS---------- OF A SOUTH KOREAN RIVAL. THAT RIVAL HAD USED THAT INFORMATION TO---------- TAILOR ITS OWN BIDS AND TAKE AWAY THE COMPETITION.---------------------  "SO THE DALLAS COMPANY HIRED A PRIVATE DETECTIVE AGENCY. THEY---------- DISCOVERED A COAT CLOSET AT CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS HAD A SMALL BOX---------- INSIDE THAT ROOM CONTAINING A RADIO TRANSMITTER THAT WAS WIRED TO A---------- CABLE THAT LED TO ONE OF THE COMPANY'S FAX MACHINES. THE BUG HAD BEEN---------- PLANTED BY A NEW EMPLOYEE WHO HAD BEEN A MOLE FOR THE SOUTH KOREAN---------- COMPANY. SO IN ORDER FOR THAT DALLAS COMPUTER COMPANY TO BE PENETRATED-----------A DECADE AGO, THE KOREAN MOLE HAD TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE FAX MACHINE----------, SPLICE IN A TAP, HIDE THE RADIO TRANSMITTER IN THE CLOSET.---------------------  "TODAY, IT'S MUCH EASIER, AND I WANT TO CITE JUST ONE EXAMPLE. TODAY---------- MOST PRINTERS AND FAXES AND OTHER PERIPHERALS THAT HAVE INFRARED PORTS---------- FOR DATA EXCHANGE AND SO DOES YOUR PALM PILOT, OR I HAVE UP HERE A---------- LITTLE DEMONSTRATIVE EVIDENCE, A VISOR. AS I WALK INTO YOUR CONFERENCE---------- ROOM FOR A MEETING, MY VISOR CAN COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR PRINTER, WHICH---------- MAY BE CONNECTED TO YOUR NETWORK. IF I CAN BEAM INTO YOUR PRINTER, I---------- CAN OWN YOUR NETWORK. OFTENTIMES COMPANIES HAVE PRINTERS, FAX MACHINES---------- AND OTHER DESKTOPS RIGHT IN LINE OF SIGHT AS PEOPLE ENTER THE---------- PREMISES.---------------------  "SO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS THE NEXT TIME A BICYCLE COURIER DROPS---------- INTO YOUR OFFICE. AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER PRACTICAL INSIGHT AS---------- TO WHAT CAN TAKE PLACE.---------------------  "WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE, THERE WAS A COMMON SCAM BEING RUN BY---------- UNSCRUPULOUS BICYCLE COURIERS WHO VISITED VIRTUALLY EVERY OFFICE AND---------- THEY WOULD ASK TO USE THE PHONE TO CALL THE DISPATCHER AFTER THEY HAD---------- DROPPED OFF THEIR PACKAGE TO YOUR OFFICE. OF COURSE, THEY HAD SET UP A---------- 1-900 NUMBER WHICH THEY WERE COLLECTING EITHER A DOLLAR OR TWO ON---------- EVERY CALL THAT WAS BEING MADE AND PLACED.---------------------  "NOW, IF THEY CAN BE CREATIVE ENOUGH TO PUT A SYSTEM LIKE THAT TOGETHER---------- WHERE THEY CAN MAKE QUITE A FEW DOLLARS, IMAGINE IF THEY CARRY AND---------- COME IN WITH A LITTLE INFRARED DEVICE THAT CAN DOWNLOAD INFORMATION---------- OFF ONE OF YOUR PRINTERS OR FAX-MACHINES. SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL---------- WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM.---------------------  "AS THIS CHAIN OF CONNECTIVITY GROWS EXPONENTIALLY, THE NUMBER OF WEAK---------- LINKS IS GOING TO GROW EVEN FASTER, AND NO ONE -- I WILL SAY NO ONE---------- -- IS PROPERLY PREPARED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THIS EMERGING EMBEDDED----------, NETWORKED ENVIRONMENT. AND SO THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE---------- WORKING VERY HARD TO EXPLOIT YOUR VULNERABILITY.---------------------  "AS I WAS LOOKING OVER THE MATERIAL FOR TODAY'S CONFERENCE, I ALSO CAME---------- ACROSS SOMETHING IN NEWSWEEK LAST WEEK. IT WAS IN THE CYBERSCOPE, AND---------- IT HAD TWO NEW ITEMS THAT IT CALLED THE READER'S ATTENTION TO. ONE IS---------- CALLED BEAMIE BABY, AND IT TALKS ABOUT TAKING YOUR PALM PILOT OR YOUR---------- VISOR, WALKING THROUGH AN AIRPORT-AND THEY WOULD HAVE A CEREAL SIZE---------- BOX WHICH YOU COULD DOWNLOAD YOUR E-MAIL OR GET INFORMATION OFF THE---------- INTERNET. WELL, IF YOU ARE BEAMING UP FROM YOUR PALM PILOT OR YOUR---------- VISOR OR OTHER PDA THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE INFORMATION YOU PULL OF THE---------- INTERNET, YOU CAN ALSO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE PULLING---------- INFORMATION OUT OF YOUR PALM PILOT. SO IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF---------- PROPRIETARY DATA WHICH HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED SO YOU CAN TRAVEL---------- CONVENIENTLY, YOU'D BETTER TAKE CARE THAT THAT INFORMATION IS FULLY---------- PROTECTED.---------------------  "MICROSOFT, ALSO IT SAYS 'MICROSOFT'S LATEST TRICK, A PHONE WITH A---------- PC BUILT IN,' AND IT HAS A NICE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PDA AND A---------- PHONE, WHICH IS VERY CONVENIENT TO HAVE IT ALL IN ONE. ONE OF THE---------- PROBLEMS, OF COURSE, IS THAT YOUR PHONE CAN BE PUT ON REMOTELY.---------- ASSUMING YOUR PHONE IS TURNED OFF AND YOU'RE IN A CONFERENCE ROOM, YOU---------- SHOULD TAKE CARE TO TAKE THE BATTERY OUT OF YOUR PHONE BECAUSE YOUR---------- PHONE CAN BE ACTIVATED AND SERVE AS A RECEIVER AND THE ENTIRE---------- CONVERSATION CAN BE PICKED UP REMOTELY. AND SO THIS PDA COMBINATION---------- PHONE THAT'S GREAT AND IS CONVENIENT, IT ALSO CAN BE A DEVICE---------- DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU HAVE IN IT THAT CAN BE EXTRACTED REMOTELY IN A---------- MATTER OF NANOSECONDS.---------------------  "NOW, THERE ARE SOME BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS KIND---------- OF ESPIONAGE. YOU HAVE LAWYERS WHO ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO BRING A---------- LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF SHAREHOLDERS OR YOUR PARTNERS OR THE COMPANY THAT---------- YOU MIGHT BE MERGING OR ACQUIRING FOR YOUR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY TO---------- PROTECT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. SO YOU MUST TAKE CARE. YOU ARE---------- CHARGED AS A FIDUCIARY WITH PROTECTING PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND YOU---------- MUST PERSONALLY UNDERTAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE PROPER---------- BARRIERS AND THE KIND OF PROTECTIVE TECHNIQUES TO PROTECT THAT---------- INFORMATION. OTHERWISE YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF SUBJECT TO A LAWSUIT.---------------------  "SECONDLY, THERE ARE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THEIR PERSONAL AND---------- COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL POLICIES THAT ARE VERY CAREFUL TO EXCLUDE---------- ANY COVERAGE FOR LOSS OF IT INFORMATION. THEY ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO---------- SELL YOU ADDITIONAL POLICIES TO COVER THIS SORT OF INFORMATION----------, HOWEVER. SO THERE IS ANOTHER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY THERE, BUT THAT'S---------- NOT THE KIND I THINK THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROMOTE.---------------------  "SO THE QUESTION IS THESE ARE THE PROBLEMS AS WE BECOME MORE AND MORE---------- CONNECTED AND WIRED TOGETHER WE BECOME INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE TO---------- PEOPLE WHO ARE PULLING THAT INFORMATION FROM OUR VERY MIDST. THERE IS---------- A TWO-EDGED SWORD OF TECHNOLOGY. YOU CAN HAVE FIREWALLS. YOU MUST---------- ERECT FIREWALLS TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION, BUT BE CAREFUL. THE---------- PEOPLE WHO MAY BE MARKETING THE FIREWALLS MAY ALSO HAVE A TRAP DOOR IN---------- THE FIREWALL SO THAT THEY CAN PULL ALL OF THE INFORMATION OUT EITHER---------- FOR THEIR COMPANIES OR FOR THEIR COUNTRIES WHO MAY BE SPONSORING THE---------- COMPANIES WHO ARE SELLING THE FIREWALLS.---------------------  "THERE IS AVAILABLE EXPORTABLE ENCRYPTION PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE AND---------- SO FORTH, BUT THIS TECHNOLOGY REALLY CAN'T OVERCOME FAULTY HUMAN---------- BEINGS WHO CREATE THESE VULNERABILITIES SO WE NEED OTHER THINGS. WE---------- NEED TO HAVE EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SECURITY POLICIES, TRAINING AND---------- REGULAR RE-TRAINING BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING SO RAPIDLY---------- WE'VE GOT TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE OUR AWARENESS OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND---------- WHAT IS POTENTIAL.---------------------  "WE HAVE TO HAVE EFFECTIVE EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT---------- DOES NOT DO OFFENSIVE WARNING AS SUCH. IT WILL WARN COMPANIES IF THEY---------- KNOW THEY ARE BEING TARGETED. SO IF YOU ARE A U.S. COMPANY AND YOU ARE---------- BEING TARGETED BY ANOTHER INTELLIGENCE SERVICE TO GAIN INFORMATION FOR---------- PROPRIETARY INFORMATION FOR YOUR COMPETITION, THEY WILL ALERT YOU TO---------- THIS. THEY DO NOT PROVIDE YOU WITH ANY INFORMATION. SO WE HAVE TO HAVE---------- EFFECTIVE EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS, AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR SHOULD BE---------- WILLING TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THERE IS GREAT---------- RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO ESTABLISH TOO MUCH OF---------- A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. I THINK THAT'S A---------- MISTAKE. BUT THERE IS A LACK OF TRUST THERE THAT YOU'RE NUMBER ONE---------- AFRAID TO REPORT THAT SOME OF YOUR SYSTEMS EITHER HAVE BEEN---------- COMPROMISED, THAT YOU HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF EXTERNAL ATTEMPTS TO---------- PENETRATE YOUR SYSTEMS, THAT THIS INFORMATION MIGHT SOMEHOW BE---------- DISSEMINATED IN WAYS THAT WOULD INJURE YOUR COMPANY. BUT I BELIEVE---------- THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROTECTION IN THE FUTURE, THEN WE HAVE TO---------- FIND WAYS OF SHARING INFORMATION AND SETTING UP A TRUST RELATIONSHIP---------- WITH VARIOUS AGENCIES WITHIN VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS IN THE U.S.---------- GOVERNMENT THAT CAN HELP YOU PROTECT YOUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.---------------------  "BECAUSE YOU BEAR LIABILITY, BECAUSE YOU ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE, IT IS---------- IMPORTANT THAT YOU NOT LEAVE IT SIMPLY TO THE HIRED HELP. IT IS---------- IMPORTANT THAT YOUR PROBE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PARTNERS AND YOUR---------- SUPPLIERS AND PEOPLE WHO YOU HIRE ON A TEMPORARY BASIS. HOW MANY OF---------- YOU HERE HAVE FOUND THE SITUATION, I CERTAINLY HAVE FOUND IT, THAT---------- SUDDENLY ONE OF YOUR KEY SECRETARIES IS OUT AND YOU HAVE A TEMPORARY---------- THAT COMES IN. WHO CHECKS THE BACKGROUND OF THE TEMPORARY? HOW MUCH---------- ACCESS DOES HE OR SHE HAVE TO YOUR NETWORKING SYSTEMS? YOU HAVE GOT TO---------- ADOPT A VERY AGGRESSIVE, AFFIRMATIVE DUTY TO CHECK ALL OF THIS OUT.---------- OTHERWISE, YOU OPEN YOURSELF UP TO THE LIABILITY.---------------------  "SO OUTSOURCING PRUDENCE, SUBJECT YOUR CONTRACT AND YOUR TEMPORARY---------- EMPLOYEES TO THE SAME PERSONNEL CHECKS YOU WOULD YOUR PERMANENT---------- WORKFORCE, AND BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL AND DELIBERATE IN DECIDING WHAT---------- ACCESS THEY HAVE.---------------------  "FINALLY, THE PUBLIC WAKE-UP THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. I MENTIONED ASIS---------- BEFORE. THEY SURVEYED COMPANIES WHO SEE FOREIGN COMPETITORS----------, ESPECIALLY FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, AS A LOW THREAT. THE FBI---------- REPORTS NEARLY A QUARTER OF ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE INVOLVED FOREIGN---------- NATIONS AND THE THREAT IS EMANATING FROM SOME 23 COUNTRIES TODAY.---------------------  "SO THIS IS SOMETHING. IT IS SERIOUS. IT IS GROWING. YOU SHOULD BE---------- AWARE OF IT. YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON IT. THE GOAL, OF COURSE, IS TO---------- PROTECT THE MISSION. NO SYSTEM IS FOOLPROOF. NO HUMAN IS FAULTLESS.---------- PERFECTION IS NOT THE OBJECTIVE, BUT THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROTECT THE---------- CORPORATION'S MISSION. AND REMEMBER THAT INCLUDES PROTECTING YOUR---------- PARTNERS AND YOUR CUSTOMERS.---------------------  "THERE IS A WONDERFUL QUOTE FROM T.S. ELIOT. HE ASKED THE QUESTION---------- WHERE IS THE WISDOM WE HAVE LOST IN KNOWLEDGE AND WHERE IS THE---------- KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE LOST IN INFORMATION. AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT WHERE---------- IS THE BUSINESS WE HAVE LOST IN THE INFORMATION-THAT'S BEING STOLEN.---------------------THANK YOU VERY MUCH.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
