IN A TIME OF RECORD DEFICIT SPENDING, THE PRESIDENT----- HAS STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL SPEND 1.5 BILLION DOLLARS ON THE------ DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE- TO ENSURE THAT ONLY HETEROSEXUAL MEN AND WOMEN WILL BE----- ALLOWED TO MARRY. THE RECENT MASSACHUSETTS SUPREME-COURT RULING THAT IT IS----- UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO PREVENT HOMOSEXUALS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE RIGHTS AND----- RESPONSIBILITIES OF MARRIAGE HAS CAUSED A FIRESTORM OF PROTESTS BY BOTH----- CIVIL AND CHURCH LEADERS. IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT BEGINNING WITH ADAM AND EVE----- GOD HAS ORDAINED THE INSTITUTION OF-MARRIAGE AS A HOLY RITE. THE MARRIAGE OF----- GAYS IS THUS SEEN AS AN ATTACK ON THE SANCTITY OF THE INSTITUTION OF----- MARRIAGE. GAY MARRIAGE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A SACRILEGE UNDERCUTTING THE----- VERY DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE THAT HAS EXISTED FROM THE DAWN OF RECORDED----- HISTORY.------------------ LOOKING CLOSER AT THE BIBLICAL AND HISTORICAL RECORD SHOWS US THAT IDEAS OF----- MARRIAGE HAVE CHANGED CONSIDERABLY OVER THE MILLENNIA. PRACTICES ONCE DEEMED----- PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE ARE NOW CONSIDERED TO BE ABHORRENT. THE NEW TESTAMENT----- CAN BE SEEN AT TIMES TO RADICALLY CHANGE THE UNDERSTANDING OF MARRIAGE----- RESULTING IN A MUCH MORE EMPOWERED POSITION FOR WOMEN IN MARRIAGE, EVEN AS----- AT OTHER TIMES IT SEEMS TO FIRMLY PLACE WOMEN UNDER THE SUBJECTION OF MEN.----- CAN IT BE THAT MARRIAGE IS NOT THE MONOLITHIC ENTITY IT IS SO OFTEN----- PURPORTED TO BE IN THE RHETORIC OPPOSING GAY MARRIAGE? PERHAPS THERE ARE----- WAYS OF FAITHFULLY LOOKING AT BOTH SCRIPTURE AND THE VALUES HELD BY THE----- CHURCH THAT LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF THE CHURCH AFFIRMING AND BLESSING----- GAY MARRIAGES.----------------- EVEN THOUGH THE BIBLE HAS BEEN USED AS A SOURCE OF THE IDEA THAT MARRIAGE IS----- A SACRED RITE ORDAINED BY GOD FROM THE BEGINNING OF HISTORY, THERE IS----- SURPRISINGLY LITTLE DISCUSSION IN THE HEBREW OR NEW TESTAMENT SCRIPTURES----- ABOUT WHAT A MARRIAGE ACTUALLY IS. A SEARCH FOR THE WORDS- MARRIAGE-------, MARRY- OR- WIFE- IN THE BIBLE YIELD NUMEROUS VERSES. YET VIRTUALLY NONE OF----- THESE DISCUSSES EXACTLY WHAT A MARRIAGE IS. ONE IS HARD PRESSED TO FIND----- VERSES CONTAINING ANYTHING RESEMBLING- THE LORD SAYS A MARRIAGE HAPPENS----- WHEN-- OR- MARRIAGE IS GODS WAY OF-- OR- THE REASON THE LORD WANTS US TO BE----- MARRIED IS--. THERE ARE CASES WHERE THE EMPHASIS IS ON MAKING SURE THE----- ISRAELITES DO NOT MARRY FOREIGNERS SUCH AS IN NEHEMIAH 13:-27 SHALL WE THEN----- LISTEN TO YOU AND DO ALL THIS GREAT EVIL AND ACT TREACHEROUSLY AGAINST OUR----- GOD BY MARRYING FOREIGN WOMEN?-(ALL SCRIPTURE REFERENCES ARE NEW REVISED----- STANDARD VERSION UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.). THERE ARE ALSO INSTANCES WHERE A----- MARRIAGE IS SEEN AS A WAY OF FORMING ALLIANCES AS IN 2 CHRONICLES 18:-1 NOW----- JEHOSHAPHAT HAD GREAT RICHES AND HONOR; AND HE MADE A MARRIAGE ALLIANCE WITH----- AHAB-. LEVITICUS 18:18 INSTRUCTS MEN THAT- YOU SHALL NOT TAKE A WOMAN AS A----- RIVAL TO HER SISTER, UNCOVERING HER NAKEDNESS WHILE HER SISTER IS-STILL----- ALIVE.- INTERESTINGLY, THE EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO THE PROHIBITION ON MARRYING----- TWO SISTERS SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT IT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE----- WIFE AS LONG AS THEY WERE NOT RELATED, A PRACTICE CERTAINLY FROWNED UPON IN----- MODERN TIMES. THE MAJORITY OF CASES IN SCRIPTURE SEEM TO SIMPLY ASSUME THAT----- MARRIAGE IS A PREEXISTING CULTURAL ENTITY AND THAT THE READER WOULD----- UNDERSTAND WHAT A MARRIAGE IS WITHOUT FURTHER EXPLANATION. BUT JUST WHAT WAS----- THIS CULTURAL ENTITY IN ANCIENT TIMES?----------------- IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES WHERE IT IS DISCUSSED IN THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES----- MARRIAGE IS PRESENTED AS A RATHER ONE-SIDED TRANSACTION. DAUGHTERS ARE----- USUALLY SEEN AS OBJECTS- GIVEN- IN MARRIAGE BY THEIR FATHERS. GENESIS 34:-----21 STATES- LET US TAKE THEIR DAUGHTERS IN MARRIAGE, AND LET US GIVE THEM OUR----- DAUGHTERS-. IN I KINGS 11:19 THERE IS EVEN AN ACCOUNT OF PHARAOH GIVING THE----- SISTER OF HIS WIFE AS A BRIDE TO HADAD. OFTEN THE HUSBAND IS NOT EVEN THE----- PARTY NEGOTIATING FOR THE BRIDE, BUT THE FATHER OF THE HUSBAND, AS IN----- 2 KINGS 14:-9 GIVE YOUR DAUGHTER TO MY SON FOR A WIFE-. SELDOM IF EVER IS THE----- WIFE PORTRAYED AS HAVING ANY DECISION-MAKING POWER IN THE CHOICE OF A----- HUSBAND, OR EVEN ANY INPUT ON THE SUBJECT. YAMAUCH SUPPORTS THIS VIEW BY----- NOTING THAT IN- ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA MARRIAGES WERE ARRANGED BY PARENTS-THE----- CONSENT OF THE BRIDE WAS NOT NECESSARY-(YAMAUCH 1978, 241). THERE ARE FEW IF----- ANY REFERENCES IN THE BIBLE TO THE MINIMUM AGE OF BRIDES, BUT AN INDICATION----- OF LIKELY MINIMUM AGES CAN BE-SEEN GLEANED-IN NOTING THAT IN ANCIENT- EGYPT----- GIRLS WERE MARRIED BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWELVE AND FOURTEEN- (YAMAUCH----- 1978, 242).-ARRANGED MARRIAGES ARE CERTAINLY STILL PREVALENT IN MANY CULTURES----- ACROSS THE GLOBE. HOWEVER, IN THE WEST PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES-----, THE IDEA OF A-WOMAN AS THE PROPERTY OF HER FATHER AND BEING FORCED TO MARRY----- AGAINST HER WILL AND BECOME THE PROPERTY OF HER HUSBAND IS NOW USUALLY SEEN----- AS OVERLY OPPRESSIVE-TO THE FREEDOM OF WOMEN. FURTHERMORE, AN ATTEMPT BY A----- GROWN MAN TO MARRY WHAT MODERN SOCIETY CALLS A GIRL OF TWELVE-YEARS OLD----- WOULD BE SEEN NOW AS A HEINIOUS ACT OF PEDOPHILIA.----------------- THERE IS USUALLY VERY LITTLE MENTION OF LOVE IN THE ROMANTIC SENSE AS A----- BASIS FOR MARRIAGE IN THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES. WHEN THERE IS ANY MENTION OF----- LOVE IT IS USUALLY A MATTER OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL HUSBAND WANTS, WITH NO----- CONCERN MENTIONED ABOUT THE WOMAN-S WISHES. SUCH IS THE CASE IN THE GENESIS----- 29 ACCOUNT OF JACOB WHO LOVED RACHEL, YET THERE IS NO MENTION OF A----- RECIPROCAL LOVE ON THE PART OF RACHEL FOR JACOB. LATER IN THE STORY, WHEN----- RACHEL AND HER SISTER LEAH ARE BOTH MARRIED TO JACOB, THE SISTERS- SQUABBLES----- ARE NOT OVER THE LOVE OF JACOB, BUT OVER WHO WILL BEAR HIM SONS AND THUS----- INHERIT THE WEALTH OF JACOB. THE INHERITANCE OF THIS WEALTH WOULD THUS----- ENABLE THE SON TO CARE FOR THE MOTHER. ADDITIONALLY, THIS ACCOUNT OF----- MULTIPLE WIVES IS NEITHER FROWNED UPON WITHIN THE STORY, NOR IS IT THE ONLY----- SUCH CASE IN THE BIBLE. THERE IS EVEN AN INSTANCE WHERE GOD APPEARS TO BLESS----- THE UNION OF A MAN WITH HIS MAIDSERVANTS, AS IN THE STORY OF ABIMELECH IN----- GENESIS---- IN THIS STORY, AFTER ABIMELECH RETURNS SARAH TO ABRAHAM GOD----- BLESSES HIM BY HEALING HIS WIFE AND MAIDSERVANTS SO THAT THEY BEAR CHILDREN.----- WHILE IT DOESN-T EXPLICITLY STATE THE MAIDSERVANTS BORE HIM CHILDREN, IT----- STRONGLY IMPLIES SUCH. SARAH HERSELF GIVES HER OWN SERVANT HAGAR TO ABRAHAM----- AS A WIFE TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN. SARAH IS EVEN DESCRIBED AS ABRAHAM-S HALF----- SISTER. WHILE MANY MODERN SOCIETIES MIGHT FROWN ON THESE PRACTICES, THEY ARE----- PRESENTED WITHIN THESE CANONICAL SCRIPTURAL STORIES WITH A MATTER-OF-FACT----- NONCHALANCE AS IF THAT IS JUST THE WAY THINGS WERE DONE AT THE TIME.----------------- MEN WERE SEEMINGLY SEEN AS THE SOURCE OF LIFE ITSELF IN MARRIAGE----- RELATIONSHIPS, AS CAN BE SEEN IN ADAM-S DECLARATION IN GENESIS 4:1 THAT- I----- HAVE PRODUCED A MAN WITH THE HELP OF THE LORD-. THERE IS NO MENTION OF- WE------ MADE A MAN IMPLYING A PARTNERSHIP WITH EVE, OR INDEED EVEN-THE KNOWLEDGE OF----- THE BASIC BIOLOGICAL FACTS OF PROCREATION AS WE KNOW THEM TODAY. THE EVENT----- IS PORTRAYED AS A CREATIVE ACT BETWEEN GOD AND ADAM, WITH EVE MERELY----- PROVIDING A PLACE FOR THE CHILD TO GROW. THIS FOCUS ON PROCREATION HAD A----- GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH THE-INHERITANCE OF WEALTH. WIVES WERE EXPECTED TO BEAR----- CHILDREN FOR THEIR HUSBANDS IN LARGE PART SO THAT THE MAN WOULD HAVE AN HEIR----- TO INHERIT HIS WEALTH. WHILE- THE RIGHT OF A WIDOW TO INHERIT THE PROPERTY----- OF HER DECEASED HUSBAND WAS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN THE CULTURES OF THE----- ANCIENT NEAR EAST- (DAVIES 1981, 138), SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE IN ANCIENT----- HEBREW SOCIETY. IF A HEBREW WIFE HAD NO MALE CHILDREN THEN- THE NEAREST----- KINSMEN OF THE HUSBAND WOULD HAVE-SUCCEEDED TO THE ESTATE-(DAVIES----- 1981, 138-9). THIS PRECARIOUS SITUATION OF CHILDLESS-WIDOWS IS LIKELY A SOURCE OF----- THE BIBLE-S EMPHASIS ON CONCERN FOR WIDOWS AND ORPHANS. ONE POSSIBLE----- EXCEPTION THAT ALLOWED A WOMAN WITH-NO SONS TO PARTICIPATE IN HER HUSBAND-S----- ESTATE WAS KNOWN AS THE LEVIRATE MARRIAGE-IN WHICH- THE BROTHERS OF THE----- DECEASED HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROVIDING THE WIDOW WITH MALE----- HEIRS-(DAVIES 1981, 139). THE ASSUMPTION SEEMS TO BE THAT THE MALE HEIRS----- THAT INHERITED THE HUSBAND-S ESTATE WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO CARE FOR THEIR----- MOTHER. SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE ALMOST UNTHINKABLE TODAY.----------------- THE NEW TESTAMENT SOMETIMES SEEMS TO REEMPHASIZE THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES----- SUBORDINATE STATUS OF THE WIFE. IN 1 CORINTHIANS 11:3 PAUL STATES THAT------ CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF EVERY MAN, AND THE HUSBAND IS THE HEAD OF HIS WIFE-.----- THROUGHOUT THE NEW TESTAMENT CHRIST IS REFERRED TO AS OUT LORD AND RULER. IN----- THIS CONTEXT OF CHRIST AS OUR RULER, IT WOULD BE EASY TO VIEW THESE VERSES----- IN I CORINTHIANS AS LAYING OUT THE NATURAL ORDER OF HUMANITY: CHRIST IS THE----- RULER OF MEN, AND HUSBANDS ARE THE RULERS OF WIVES. INDEED, CHURCH----- LEADERSHIP HAS OFTEN USED THESE SCRIPTURES TO DEFEND JUST SUCH A POSITION.----- YET THIS PASSAGE IS SANDWICHED BETWEEN DISCUSSIONS OF CHURCH LITURGICAL AND----- EATING PRACTICES WITH EMPHASIS ON THE PREVENTION OF BECOMING A STUMBLING----- BLOCK TO NEW BELIEVERS. IT SEEMS QUITE A BIT OUT OF PLACE TO THROW IN A FEW----- VERSES ABOUT- THE RIGHTFUL PLACE OF WOMEN- IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE CHAPTERS.----- FURTHER, PAUL IS UNDOUBTEDLY SPEAKING TO THE PREVAILING CULTURAL PRACTICES----- WHEN HE SAYS SHORTLY THEREAFTER IN 11:-14 DOES NOT NATURE ITSELF TEACH YOU----- THAT IF A MAN WEARS LONG HAIR, IT IS DEGRADING TO HIM?- THE READERS IN----- CORINTH WOULD SEE IT AS SELF-EVIDENT THAT A WOMAN SHOULD HAVE LONG HAIR, AND----- A MAN SHOULD HAVE SHORT HAIR. YET MANY CULTURES DO NOT HOLD THAT MEN SHOULD----- HAVE SHORT HAIR. GOD EVEN GAVE SAMSON A COVENANT OF STRENGTH THROUGH HIS----- LONG HAIR. IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE AND PROBABLE THAT PAUL-S ASSESSMENT OF----- THE HUSBAND AS HEAD OF THE WIFE REFLECTED NOT AN EDIT OF THE WAY THINGS MUST----- BE, BUT A REFLECTION OF HOW THINGS WERE AT THE TIME. WE ARE THEN LEFT WITH----- THE PROSPECT OF DETERMINING HOW WE APPLY THE OVERRIDING PRINCIPLES TO OUR----- CULTURE TODAY.----------------- PAUL EMPHASIZES THE MORE EGALITARIAN NATURE OF LIFE IN CHRIST WHEN HE STATES----- IN GALATIANS 3:38 THAT- THERE IS NO LONGER JEW OR GREEK, THERE IS NO LONGER----- SLAVE OR FREE, THERE IS NO LONGER MALE AND FEMALE; FOR YOU ARE ONE IN----- CHRIST-. IN EPHESIANS 5:31 PAUL INSTRUCTS EACH HUSBAND TO- LOVE HIS WIFE AS----- HIMSELF-. THE MODERN WESTERN NOTION OF MARRIAGE AS ORIGINATING BETWEEN TWO----- PEOPLE WHO LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH THAT THEY WANT TO SPEND THEIR LIVES----- TOGETHER CAN MAKE A READING OF EPHESIANS 5:33 SEEM TO BE MERELY A FRIENDLY----- REMINDER TO NOT FALL OUT OF LOVE. THIS MESSAGE OF LOVE TOWARD WIVES CAME AT----- A TIME WHEN WIVES WERE SEEN BY THE LARGER SOCIETY AS VIRTUAL CHATTEL----- PROPERTY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE HUSBAND. THIS NOTION OF TREATING A WIFE WITH----- A SPIRIT OF LOVE INSTEAD OF OWNERSHIP CAN BE SEEN AS A VERY EMPOWERING----- EGALITARIAN MESSAGE OF THE VALUE AND DIGNITY OF WIVES.------------------ THE VERSES IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO EPHESIANS 5:31 CAN ALSO BE SEEN TO BE A----- REINTERPRETATION OF THE PASSAGE SO OFTEN QUOTED IN ORDER TO SHOW THE DIVINE----- ORDER OF MARRIAGE AS SOLELY BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN. GENESIS 2:24 READS------ THEREFORE A MAN LEAVES HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND CLINGS TO HIS WIFE, AND----- THEY BECOME ONE FLESH-. HE RESTATES IT NOT AS A REFLECTION OF THE NATURAL----- BIOLOGICAL ORDER OF HUMANITY AS CREATED IN TWO GENDERS. HERE IN EPHESIANS----- 5:29-32 HIS EMPHASIS IS ON THE UNITY IN CHRIST:- FOR NO ONE EVER HATES HIS----- OWN BODY, BUT HE NOURISHES AND TENDERLY CARES FOR IT, JUST AS CHRIST DOES----- FOR THE CHURCH, BECAUSE WE ARE MEMBERS OF HIS BODY.- FOR THIS REASON A MAN----- WILL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO WILL----- BECOME ONE FLESH--. THIS NEW TESTAMENT NOTION RECASTS MARRIAGE AWAY FROM A----- TRANSACTION OF PROPERTY AND DOMINATION TOWARDS A RELATIONSHIP OF MUTUAL----- RESPECT AND PARTNERSHIP.----------------- EVEN THOUGH THE-NATURE OF MARRIAGE CHANGES SOMEWHAT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT, IT----- IS STILL NOT RECORDED IN THE SCRIPTURES AS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS UNDER THE----- AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH. EVEN IN-THE BYZANTINE ERA MARRIAGE COULD BE SEEN TO----- HAPPEN- THROUGH A BLESSING, OR CROWNING, OR A CONTRACT- (VISCUSO 1991, 310).----- THIS NOTION OF BLESSING HERE- REFERS TO BETROTHAL- (VISCUSO 1991, 310). THIS----- BETROTHAL WAS NOT FULLY-A MARRIAGE, BUT THE PROMISE THAT SUCH MARRIAGE WOULD----- TAKE PLACE. THE BETROTHAL DIFFERED FROM A MERE VERBAL AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD----- HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AN ENGAGEMENT, IN THE FACT THAT A BETROTHAL- WAS----- BROUGHT ABOUT OR CELEBRATED THROUGH A SACRED- BLESSING--WHOSE CENTRAL----- FEATURE WAS A PRAYER-THAT THE BETROTHAL MIGHT BE CONFIRMED AND MADE----- INDISSOLUBLE- (VISCUSO 1991, 312). EVENTUALLY THE CHURCH BEGAN TO SEE----- MARRIAGE AS A SACRAMENT IMPARTING GRACE.----------------- DURING THE REFORMATION- PROTESTANT MARRIAGE THEORY BEGAN TO TAKE SHAPE: THE----- LEGITIMACY AND SIGNIFICANCE OF CIVIL AUTHORITY OVER THE INSTITUTION WAS----- RECOGNIZED; THE SACRAMENTAL STATUS WHICH THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH ACCORDED----- THE INSTITUTION WAS REMOVED- (YATES 1985, 41). YATES FURTHER NOTES THAT------ MARTIN LUTHER CONSIDERED MARRIAGE AN ORDER OF CREATION WHOSE ORIGIN------TRANSCENDED BOTH CHURCH AND STATE- (YATES, 1985 41). THIS THOUGHT BY LUTHER -----BEGAN THE BELIEF STILL HELD BY MOST PROTESTANTS THAT MARRIAGE IS AN----- INSTITUTION ORDAINED BY GOD. DURING THE REFORMATION, THE CHARACTER OF----- MARRIAGE BEGAN TO BE VIEWED AS A COVENANT RATHER THAN A CONTRACT. THIS----- COVENANT RELATIONSHIP THUS MIRRORS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND ISRAEL------ TO BECOME PARTNERS IN A RELATIONSHIP MARKED BY TRUST, FIDELITY, STEADFAST----- LOVE, JUSTICE, AND OBEDIENCE TO THE WILL OF GOD- (YATES 1985, 42).----------------- A RECENT EDITORIAL IN CHRISTIANITY TODAY NOTED THAT IN-MODERN TIMES- THE----- INCREASING PRIVATIZATION OF MARRIAGE HAS BECOME ALMOST ABSOLUTE: NEITHER THE----- COMMUNITY NOR THE PATERFAMILIAS (DOES SUCH EXIST ANYMORE?) HAS ANY SAY IN----- THE FORMATION OR DISSOLUTION OF A MARRIAGE. WHAT WAS A COMMUNITY AFFAIR FOR -----OVER 400 YEARS HAS DEVOLVED INTO JUST ONE MORE EXERCISE OF PERSONAL CHOICE -------EDITORIAL 2000, 40). THIS SAME ARTICLE DECRIES ATTEMPTS TO PROMOTE GAY----- MARRIAGES AS A THREAT BY--JUDICIAL ACTIVISM AND GAY-RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WORKING----- TOGETHER TO EMPTY MARRIAGE OF ITS TRADITIONAL MEANING- (EDITORIAL 2000, 40).----- HOWEVER, THESE REPRESENTATIVE ARGUMENTS AGAINST GAY MARRIAGES FAIL TO----- EXPLAIN IN ANY SUBSTANCE HOW ALLOWING GAY MARRIAGES WOULD IN ANY WAY CHANGE----- THE NATURE OR UNDERSTANDING OF HETEROSEXUAL MARRIAGES. THEY FAIL TO EXPLAIN----- HOW ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES- TO BECOME PARTNERS IN A RELATIONSHIP MARKED----- BY TRUST, FIDELITY, STEADFAST LOVE, JUSTICE, AND OBEDIENCE TO THE WILL OF----- GOD- (YATES 1985, 42) WOULD PREVENT HETEROSEXUALS FROM ACCESS TO THOSE SAME----- RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. NOR DOES IT SUGGEST HOW GAY MARRIAGE WOULD----- REMOVE SUCH CONNOTATIONS FROM THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE AS UNDERSTOOD BY----- THE CHURCH.----------------- OTHERS HAVE ARGUED- THAT MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY ARE VALUABLE SOCIAL----- INSTITUTIONS, ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN, BUT THAT THEY NEED TO BE----- NEWLY UNDERSTOOD IN NONPATRIARCHAL AND EGALITARIAN WAYS-MARITAL LOVE----- REFLECTS GOD'S OWN TRIUNE RELATIONALITY. MARRIAGE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO----- EXPERIENCE THE REALITY OF THE DIVINE. MARRIAGE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO----- EXPERIENCE THE REALITY OF THE DIVINE- (WALL 2000, 1120). A FRESH----- INTERPRETATION OF THE THEOLOGY OF MARRIAGE SHOULD THUS- STRIVE TO LIBERATE----- CHILDREN FROM THE WIDESPREAD AND OFTEN UNACKNOWLEDGED SUFFERING CAUSED BY----- MODERNITY-S CULTURE OF DIVORCE- (WALL 2000, 1121).------------------ THE TRADITIONAL EMPHASIS ON PROCREATION WITHIN MARRIAGE AND THE BELIEF THAT------ THE SACRAMENT-OF MARITAL LOVE FINDS ITS FURTHER EXPRESSION IN PARENTS- LOVE----- FOR THE FRUITS OF THEIR SEXUALITY- (WALL 2000, 1120) MIGHT SEEM TO EXCLUDE----- HOMOSEXUALS FROM THE MARRIAGE RITES, SINCE HOMOSEXUAL ACTS CAN NEVER PRODUCE----- OFFSPRING. YET THE VAST MAJORITY OF CURRENT CHURCHES MAKE NO OUTCRY OF----- DAMNATION AGAINST CHILDLESS COUPLES, EVEN IF COUPLES REMAIN CHILDLESS BY----- CHOICE. THE CHURCH SEES MARRIED COUPLES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE POSSIBILITY----- OF-PROCREATION BY ADOPTION OR ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION AS EQUALLY VALID----- PARENTS TO THOSE WHO HAVE THEIR OWN BIOLOGICAL CHILDREN. CHILDLESS COUPLES----- ARE STILL SEEN TO EMBODY THIS PROCREATIVE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR MARRIAGE-BY----- BEING INVOLVED IN THE-SUPPORT OF OTHER PEOPLE-S CHILDREN, OR EVEN IN THE----- SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT FOSTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE----- GENERATIONS. THE CHURCH HAS FAILED TO ADEQUATELY EXPLAIN HOW CHILDLESS----- HOMOSEXUAL COUPLES SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO MARRY ON THE BASIS OF----- INFERTILITY, WHEN THE SAME RULES DO NOT APPLY TO HETEROSEXUALS. NOR DO THEY----- EXPLAIN HOW HOMOSEXUALS WHO BECOME PARENTS VIA ADOPTION OR OTHER MEANS WOULD----- BE INCAPABLE OF PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCREATIVE NATURE OF MARRIAGE.------------------ IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EVEN THE MOST STEADFAST OPPONENTS TO GAY MARRIAGE ON----- THE GROUNDS THAT MARRIAGE IS A HOLY SACRAMENT ALLOW THAT THERE IS A CIVIL----- COMPONENT OF MARRIAGE THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THE CONSTRAINTS OF CHURCH----- DOCTRINE.-MANY CLERGY REFUSE TO MARRY COUPLES UNLESS BOTH PARTIES ARE----- COMMITTED CHRISTIANS. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH REFUSES TO RECOGNIZE A SECOND----- MARRIAGE OF SOMEONE WHO HAS DIVORCED HIS OR HER FIRST SPOUSE. SOME CHURCHES----- REFUSE TO INCLUDE MARRIAGE VOWS CALLING FOR THE WIFE TO- OBEY- HER HUSBAND-----, YET OTHER CHURCHES CONSIDER THIS VOW A FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF THE----- CEREMONY. YET NONE OF THESE CHURCHES FIGHT TO MAKE THESE RESTRICTIONS AND----- REQUIREMENTS PART OF THE COMMON LAW-OF THE LAND. ALLOWING THE STATE TO----- SANCTION GAY MARRIAGES WOULD STILL LEAVE INDIVIDUAL CHURCHES THE FREEDOM TO----- REFUSE TO PERFORM GAY MARRIAGES ON THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN BELIEFS.----------------- MANY OF THE PROPONENTS OF GAY MARRIAGE IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL SPHERE ARGUE----- FROM THE BASIS OF CIVIL RIGHTS. THEY ARGUE THAT HOMOSEXUALS SHOULD HAVE THE----- SAME RIGHT TO MARRIAGE THAT HETEROSEXUALS DO. THIS MAY BE THE CASE, BUT----- PERHAPS THIS ARGUMENT IS INCOMPLETE, AND DOES NOT FULLY COUNTER THE----- ARGUMENTS AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE AS AN ATTACK ON THE- SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE-.----- PERHAPS THE CHURCH NEEDS TO BE A PROPHETIC VOICE THAT CALLS FOR A DEEPER----- COMMITMENT BY ALL PEOPLE, HETEROSEXUAL OR OTHERWISE, TO THE SPIRITUAL----- ASPECTS OF MARRIAGE. THE CHURCH CAN AND SHOULD SUPPORT AND NURTURE MARRIAGES----- BASED ON CHRISTIAN PRINCIPALS OF LOVE, TRUST, HONESTY, COMMITMENT AND FAITH----- IN GOD. THE-CHURCH SHOULD BE THE-INSTITUTION LEADING SOCIETY TO A MORE JUST----- UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PROMOTION OF CHRIST-CENTERED MARRIAGES DOES NOT HAVE----- TO EXCLUDE HOMOSEXUALS FROM THE EQUATION. INDEED, THE VERY EXISTENCE OF----- COMMITTED CHRISTIAN, MONOGAMOUS, MARRIED HOMOSEXUAL COUPLES WITHIN THE----- COMMUNITY CAN NURTURE THE NEXT GENERATION OF HOMOSEXUAL YOUTH. MARRIED GAY----- COUPLES WITHIN THE CHURCH CAN AFFIRM TO YOUNG PEOPLE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO----- BE WHO AND WHAT GOD MADE THEM TO BE, AND STILL BE IN DEEP COMMUNION WITH GOD----- AND WITH COMMUNITY. IT CAN ALSO PROVIDE THE NEXT GENERATION WITH A MODEL FOR----- MORAL, GODLY HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOR.--------------------------- REFERENCES------------------------------------- DAVIES, ERYL W------.
