AND DELIVERING THAT PURPOSE-------- SUCCESSFULLY IS THE ONE AND ONLY TRUE KEY.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" MICHAELS-------------' ABILITY TO CONCEPTUALIZE AN EVENT AND THEN EXCEED-------- CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS-HAS BEEN HER HALLMARK AND A PRIMARY-------- REASON WHY SHE HAS PRODUCED EVENTS AROUND THE WORLD AND-------- COVETED ACCOUNTS, SUCH AS 20TH CENTURY FOX, NASA, PEPSI--------, EASTMAN KODAK, MERCEDES-BENZ AND MICROSOFT, CONTINUE TO-------- CONTRACT HER SERVICES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ BESIDES HER-------- PROVEN TRACK RECORD, MICHAELS HAS A BACKGROUND IN-------- ENTERTAINMENT AND HOLDS A MASTER'-----S DEGREE IN-------- PSYCHOLOGY------BOTH OF WHICH PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES WHEN-------- DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS AND PLANNING EVENTS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MICHAELS HAS-------- SAID THAT SHE APPROACHES EACH FUNCTION AS IF IT WERE A-------- PLAY, COMPLETE WITH AN OVERTURE, ACTS AND A FINALE. LIKE-------- A THEATRICAL PRODUCTION, A MICHAELS-PRODUCED EVENT IS-------- DESIGNED TO PROVIDE ITS AUDIENCE WITH A SENSE OF-------- ANTICIPATION, BUILDING IN EXCITEMENT AND ENJOYMENT BEFORE-------- FINALLY ENDING WITH A DISTINCT AND SATISFYING CONCLUSION.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "I WANT-------- EACH AND EVERY ELEMENT OF ANY PROJECT I'-----M INVOLVED-------- IN TO HAVE CONTENT AND MEANING AND A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE-------- FOR EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE,-----" COMMENTS MICHAELS.------------- "IN VANCOUVER (FOR THE OPENING OF GM PLACE), WHEN-------- THE OWNERS AND MANAGERS OF THE ARENA SAID-----, `I WANT-------- THE AUDIENCE TO CRY--------I REMEMBERED THAT IN-EACH AND-------- EVERY ELEMENT. THE ORCHESTRATION OF WHAT WE DID WAS SO-------- EMOTIONAL AND IMPACTFUL THAT YOU COULD WATCH-------- 22,000 PEOPLE WEEPING AS THEY STOOD AND APPLAUDED. IT WAS ABOUT-------- HOW THE ENTIRE EVENT WAS CONSTRUCTED, FLOWING AND-------- BUILDING CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL YOU COULD ALMOST SEE HEARTS-------- POUNDING WITH ENERGY, EXCITEMENT AND, BEST OF ALL--------, EMOTIONAL INVESTMENT. JUST THINKING ABOUT IT STILL GIVES-------- ME CHILLS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" ALTHOUGH SHE-------- IS ADMITTEDLY HER OWN WORST CRITIC, WHICH IS ENOUGH OF A --------BAROMETER TO JUDGE THE RELATIVE SUCCESS OF ANY EVENT WITH-------- WHICH SHE IS INVOLVED, MICHAELS DOES HAVE A SIMPLE-------- FORMULA FOR MEASURING ACHIEVEMENT.----- "SUCCESS IS WHEN-------- THE AUDIENCE SMILES, APPLAUDS AND, BEST OF ALL, YEARS-------- LATER--...-REMEMBERS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" THE SAME CAN-------- BE APPLIED TO AN EXTRAORDINARY HALL OF FAME CAREER.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FIRST---------------- YEAR IN THE INDUSTRY:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1973 WHAT---------------- I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE WHEN I GREW UP:----------------------------- AN ATTORNEY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I---------------- GOT INTO THE BUSINESS BECAUSE:----------------------------- I WAS A SINGLE PARENT AND, AT AGE---------------- 28, WENT BACK TO SCHOOL TO GET MY DEGREE.

I ANSWERED AN AD THAT---------------- READ,----- "WEST SIDE ENTERTAINMENT AGENCY NEEDS---------------- PART TIME HELP,-----" WITH THIS IMAGE IN MIND---------------- THAT I WOULD BE APPLYING WITH WILLIAM MORRIS AND---------------- CASTING SEAN CONNERY IN HIS NEXT ROLE. SURPRISE----------------! IT WAS A BAND LEADER WORKING OUT OF HIS---------------- APARTMENT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ BIGGEST---------------- EVENT SUCCESS:----------------------------- DO I HAVE TO GIVE YOU ONLY ONE? THE OPENING OF---------------- VANCOUVER'-----S GM PLACE SPORTS ARENA, WHICH---------------- FEATURED FOUR MAJOR EVENTS IN FOUR DAYS, WITH THE---------------- LARGEST BEING FOR 100,000 PEOPLE. THE MOST---------------- INNOVATIVE WAS THE 3 1/2-HOUR SHOW, WHICH WAS---------------- BROADCAST LIVE ON BCTV AND FEATURED MORE THAN---------------- 750 ENTERTAINERS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WORST---------------- EVENT DISASTER:----------------------------- ONLY ONE I CAN REMEMBER. THE SOUND---------------- COMPANY PROVIDING SOUND FOR A MAJOR SHOW JUST---------------- DIDN'-----T DELIVER. WE HAD A MAJOR COMIC---------------- PERFORM, AND THE AUDIENCE BOOED.

WE SALVAGED IT, BUT IT WAS---------------- NOT A PRETTY MOMENT IN MY CAREER. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MOST---------------- VALUABLE LESSON LEARNED:----------------------------- STAY CALM.

STREET PERFORMERS--------, STAND-UP COMEDIANS AND STAGE ACTORS ARE ALL DRAWN TO THE-------- IMMEDIACY AND INTIMACY A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE PROVIDES. THEY-------- THRIVE ON CROWD-GENERATED ELECTRICITY AND WILL SINK-OR-------- SWIM DEPENDING ON PEOPLE'S INSTANTANEOUS REACTIONS. THE-------- SAME CAN BE SAID FOR THOSE INVOLVED IN EVENT PLANNING AND-------- PRODUCTION. THE HINT OF DANGER THAT EVERY LIVE EVENT-------- CARRIES PROVIDES AN ADRENALINE RUSH THAT WOULD BE THE-------- ENVY OF EVEL KNIEVEL OR ANY DEATH-DEFYING X-GAMER. ONCE-------- THEY TASTE IT, MANY CAN'T SHAKE IT. THEY'RE INEXPLICABLY-------- HOOKED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- JACK MORTON-------- CAUGHT THE BUG AT AN EARLY AGE AND, 80 YEARS LATER, STILL-------- HASN'T GOT IT OUT OF HIS SYSTEM. BORN THE SON OF A-------- SHARECROPPER IN NORTH CAROLINA, MORTON QUICKLY DEVELOPED-------- A LOVE FOR THEATER AND STEPPED INTO SHOW BUSINESS AS A-------- 12-YEAR-OLD, WORKING AS AN USHER, TICKET-TAKER, BILL-------- POSTER AND SOMETIME JANITOR IN A SMALL-TOWN, SILENT-MOVIE-------- HOUSE. AT 18, HE WAS MANAGING AN 850-SEAT THEATER AND-------- HELPED USHER IN TALKING PICTURES FOR HIS LOYAL CLIENTELE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE-------- DEPRESSION YEARS TOOK MORTON TO WASHINGTON, D.C., WHERE-------- HE WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY.-------- BEFORE LONG, HE WAS ORGANIZING AND BOOKING DANCE BANDS-------- FOR SCHOOL DANCES, SOCIETY AFFAIRS AND EVEN PRESIDENTS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ HIS-------- EXPERIENCE IN THEATER AND MUSIC ALLOWED HIM TO BEGIN-------- PRODUCING SHOWS FOR THE BURGEONING CONVENTION INDUSTRY--------, AND IN 1939, MORTON FOUNDED JACK MORTON PRODUCTIONS AS-------- PRIMARILY AN ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION COMPANY. TODAY--------, KNOWN AS JACK MORTON WORLDWIDE, THE COMPANY HAS GROWN-------- INTO A 25-OFFICE, WORLDWIDE AGENCY, BOASTING-------- 800 EMPLOYEES WORKING ON FOUR CONTINENTS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE COMPANY-------- HAS BEEN A ROUSING SUCCESS, IN PART, BECAUSE IT HAS NEVER-------- LOST SIGHT OF THE ORIGINAL IDEALS MORTON INSTILLED BACK-------- IN------ THEN AND NOW, THE LIVE EXPERIENCE IS THE VERY-------- ESSENCE OF ANY WORK THE COMPANY PERFORMS FOR ITS CLIENTS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "IN-------- WHATEVER FORM IT COMES-BE IT THEATER, A MEETING, WEBCAST--------, OR ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATION-A LIVE EXPERIENCE CREATES THE-------- BEST LEARNING ENVIRONMENT,-----" SAYS MORTON, WHO ALSO-------- CREDITS HIS COMPANY'S LONGEVITY AND GROWTH TO ITS ABILITY-------- TO CONTINUALLY ADAPT AND EXPAND CAPABILITIES TO MEET-------- CUSTOMER NEEDS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- JACK MORTON-------- WORLDWIDE HAS GROWN TO BE A LEADER IN EXPERIENTIAL BRAND-------- COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTINUES-TO EVOLVE BY UTILIZING NEW-------- AREAS SUCH AS MOBILE MARKETING AND WEBCASTS. REGARDLESS-------- OF THE MEDIUM, WHETHER COORDINATING BROADCASTS VIA THE-------- INTERNET OR SELECTING MUSIC ROLLS FOR A PLAYER PIANO, THE-------- KEYS TO CREATING A MEMORABLE EVENT HAVE REMAINED-------- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO WHEN MORTON FIRST STARTED IN THAT-------- NORTH CAROLINA THEATER: SET MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES--------, RESPECT THE BRAND AND ENGAGE THE AUDIENCE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MORTON-------- CONTINUES TO CHAMPION THE LATTER AS THE ULTIMATE-------- MEASURING STICK FOR AN EVENT'S SUCCESS. AT 92, THE LIVE-------- EXPERIENCE STILL HOLDS A POWERFUL ALLURE.----- "THE-------- REACTION OF A LIVE AUDIENCE IS REAL,-----" HE SAYS.------------- "THERE'S NO BETTER MEASUREMENT THAN WHAT YOU CAN SEE-------- OR HEAR FROM A LIVE PARTICIPANT.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" WITH AN-------- 80-YEAR, HALL OF FAME TRACK RECORD TO BACK HIM UP, WHO'S-------- GOING TO ARGUE?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FIRST---------------- YEAR IN THE INDUSTRY:----------------------------- I STARTED WHEN I WAS 12 YEARS OLD!

AS A---------CHILD, HE LOVED TO TINKER WITH THE PARTS FROM DISCARDED-------- VENDING MACHINES FROM HIS FATHER'S BUSINESS. BY THE TIME-------- HE WAS IN THE FIFTH GRADE, HE HAD CREATED AND INSTALLED A-------- BANK OF 15 COLORED SPOTLIGHTS IN THE WALL OF HIS ROOM AND-------- BUILT A SYSTEM TO PLAY THE LIGHTS WITH MUSIC, SHOOTING-------- COLOR OUT INTO THE ROOM. AS A SOPHOMORE IN, HE DESIGNED-------- AND BUILT A COMPLETE LIGHTING SYSTEM FOR THE STAGE AT HIS-------- HIGH SCHOOL. CLEARLY, HE HAD FOUND HIS DESTINY EARLY IN-------- LIFE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THOMPSON-------- FOUNDED IMAGES BY LIGHTING IN 1983, AND WAS TRULY ONE OF-------- THE INDUSTRY PIONEERS IN THE WAYS HE HAS USED LIGHTING TO-------- ENHANCE, ACCENTUATE AND ADD EXCITEMENT TO THE WORLD OF-------- EVENTS.----- "IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT LIGHTING TO ME. I LOVED-------- IT. IT WAS IN MY HEART,-----" SAYS THOMPSON.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WHEN-------- THOMPSON GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA-------- WITH AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEGREE, HE SAYS,----- "I-------- DECIDED IF I WAS GOING TO FIND MY DESTINY, IT WOULD BE IN-------- LOS ANGELES, AND I ACCEPTED A JOB OFFER FROM HUGHES-------- AIRCRAFT.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" WHILE-------- WORKING IN LOS ANGELES, HE DESIGNED A LIGHTING PROJECT-------- FOR A FRIEND IN BEVERLY HILLS. HIS FRIEND'S FRIENDS-------- QUICKLY DISCOVERED HIS TALENT FOR LIGHTING, LEADING TO A-------- VARIETY OF HOME AND COMMERCIAL LIGHTING PROJECTS. MOVIE-------- PRODUCER ALLEN CARR WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THOMPSON'S WORK-------- IN HIS (CARR'S) HOME THAT IN 1984 HE ASKED THOMPSON TO-------- DESIGN THE LIGHTING FOR-ONE OF HIS PREMIERS.-THE SUCCESS-------- OF THE PREMIER LED THOMPSON TO TEAM UP WITH THE SOME OF-------- THE TOP DESIGNERS, PLANNERS AND COMPANIES, WHOSE VISIONS-------- GAVE BIRTH TO THE EVENT INDUSTRY AS WE KNOW IT TODAY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ALONG THIS-------- STORIED JOURNEY TO HIS HALL OF FAME INAUGURATION--------, THOMPSON'S PROJECTS HAVE TAKEN HIM TO COUNTRIES ALL OVER-------- THE GLOBE, AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. HIS-------- EXPERTISE, CREATIVITY AND EASY CONVERSATIONAL STYLE HAVE-------- MADE HIM A VALUED SPEAKER, PRESENTER AND LECTURER ON THE-------- SUBJECT OF LIGHTING.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MORE-------- IMPORTANTLY, MANY TOP DESIGNERS AND PRODUCERS LOOK TO-------- THOMPSON WHEN THEY NEED THEIR-EVENT TO BE EDGY OR --------OVER-THE-TOP-----! "I WORK WITH DESIGNERS, DECORATORS AND-------- SCENIC DESIGNERS WHO ARE CREATING WORLDS,-----" HE-------- EXPLAINS.----- "I AM THERE TO SUPPORT THEM. I WANT PEOPLE-------- TO SEE THE MAGIC.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" THOMPSON AND-------- IMAGES BY LIGHTING'S EXCELLENCE HAS EARNED NUMEROUS-------- PRESTIGIOUS HONORS AND AWARDS. WHEN ASKED FOR ADVICE, HE-------- SAYS,----- "I NEVER TAKE SO MUCH BUSINESS THAT IT-------- COMPROMISES THE QUALITY. I ALWAYS GIVE SOMETHING EXTRA TO-------- THE CLIENT THAT THEY DID NOT EXPECT. I DO THAT WITH-------- LIGHTING SOME ASPECT OF THE EVENT THAT I FIND IS SPECIAL-------- TO ME. IT IS MY PASSION TO BE ABLE TO CREATE WITH-------- LIGHT.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" FIRST---------------- YEAR IN THE INDUSTRY:----------------------------- I CREATED IMAGES BY LIGHTING IN---------------- 1983, BUT WHEN I WAS A SOPHOMORE IN HIGH SCHOOL, I---------------- DESIGNED AND BUILT THE COMPLETE LIGHTING SYSTEM---------------- FOR MY SCHOOL'S STAGE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WHAT---------------- I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE WHEN I GREW UP:----------------------------- THE FIRST THING I REMEMBER WANTING TO BE WAS A---------------- CHICKEN EGG FARMER.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I---------------- GOT INTO THE BUSINESS BECAUSE:----------------------------- EVEN IN MY SENIOR YEAR AT THE UCF, I WASN'T SURE---------------- IF THAT [ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING] WAS WHAT I WAS---------------- GOING TO DO.

ROMAN'-----S-------- GREATEST STRENGTH IS TO TEACH PROVEN, USEFUL AND DARING-------- SKILLS TO EXISTING SALES TEAMS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ROMAN IS-------- PRESIDENT OF---- CATERSOURCE-----, WHICH IS A CONSULTING--------, SEMINAR, AND PUBLISHING BUSINESS HELPING ALL TYPES OF-------- FOOD SERVICE BUSINESS ACHIEVE BETTER PROFITABILITY. THE-------- NEW---- CATERSOURCE----- MAGAZINE, WHICH IS BEING-------- LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER, 2003, WILL ADD GREATLY TO-------- ROMAN'-----S ABILITY TO BRING EDUCATION, PRODUCTS AND-------- NEWS TO PROFESSIONAL CATERERS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ROMAN HAS-------- WORKED HARD TO EARN THE TRUST OF CATERERS. HE HAS-------- PERSONALLY VISITED MORE CATERING OPERATIONS AND-MET WITH-------- MORE CATERERS THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE FOOD SERVICE-------- INDUSTRY. HIS MISSION IS TO CONTINUE TO BE THE MOST AWARE-------- EDUCATOR/CONSULTANT TO THE CATERING SEGMENT OF THE---------HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ONE OF-------- ROMAN'-----S PROUDEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS WAS THE WRITING AND-------- PUBLISHING OF HIS BOOK---- CATERING: THE ART, SCIENCE------------ & MYSTERY-----. AND CATERERS LIKE TO LISTEN TO MIKE-------- ROMAN BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND THE------------- "GOOD-----" AND----- "NOT SO GOOD-----" OF CATERING--------! HE IS THE CATERER'-----S CATERER.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FIRST---------------- YEAR IN THE EVENT INDUSTRY:------------------------------ MY MOTHER WAS A GREAT CHICAGO CATERER.---------------- SO, I BEGAN WORKING IN 1958 FOR OUR FAMILY-OWNED---------------- CATERING COMPANY, THE MIXING BOWL. I LEFT TO---------------- PURSUE MY OWN CAREER AND RETURNED TO MANAGE THE---------------- MIXING BOWL IN 1974 AFTER MY PARENTS RETIRED. IN---------------- 1980, I BEGAN TO TEACH NATIONAL CATERING SEMINARS---------------- FOR THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION, WHICH---------------- LED ME TO WHERE I AM TODAY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WHAT---------------- I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE WHEN I GREW UP:---------------------------------------------- NO QUESTION ABOUT IT ... AN ACTOR! IN MANY WAYS----------------, I'-----VE MADE IT HAPPEN. TEACHING, WHICH IS MY---------------- FIRST LOVE, IS FILLED WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO ACT.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I---------------- GOT INTO THE BUSINESS BECAUSE:------------------------------ IN THE 1980S, THERE JUST WASN'-----T---------------- MUCH HAPPENING WITH RESPECT TO EDUCATION OR---------------- SHARING FOR CATERERS. I WAS A CATERER WHO ALSO---------------- HAPPENED TO BE AN EDUCATOR, SO I SAW A NICHE AND---------------- WENT FOR IT.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BIGGEST---------------- EVENT SUCCESS:------------------------------ AS A CATERER, IT WAS AN OFF-PREMISE---------------- SITDOWN DINNER SERVED IN THE FOYER OF THE---------------- UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO FOR SUPREME COURT CHIEF---------------- JUSTICE WARREN E. BURGER IN 1983 FOR 700 GUESTS.---------------- IT WAS ONE OF THOSE WONDERFUL CATERING NIGHTS---------------- WHERE EVERYTHING WENT AS PLANNED. WE GOT THE---------------- ENTREE SERVED IN LESS THAN 9 MINUTES-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------! BIGGEST---------------- DISASTER:------------------------------ SIMPLE. WHEN I WAS A YOUNG CATERER, I---------------- FORGOT A CLIENT'-----S EVENT DATE. BLEW IT---------------- TOTALLY. LEARNED MY LESSON. APOLOGIZED. GAVE HER---------------- NEXT PARTY FOR FREE. SHE STAYED A CLIENT-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------! MOST---------------- VALUABLE LESSON LEARNED:------------------------------ IT'-----S EASIER TO FIND NEW CLIENTS---------------- THEN IT IS TO LOSE CONTACT WITH FAMILY AND---------------- FRIENDS. BUSINESS IS TRULY IMPORTANT, BUT FRIENDS---------------- AND FAMILY ARE OUR REAL ASSETS. LEARNING TO KEEP---------------- THE PROPER BALANCE IS ESSENTIAL-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------! THE---------------- BEST PIECE OF ADVICE I EVER RECEIVED:------------------------------ IN 1984, A CLOSE FRIEND GAVE ME A FRAMED---------------- HAND-WRITTEN SIGN THAT READS-----, "ENTHUSIASM IS---------------- A CATALYST: WHEN ADDED TO WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE----------------, IT CAN FORM SMALL MIRACLES.-----" THIS SIGN STILL---------------- HANGS IN MY OFFICE. I'-----VE ALWAYS LOVED THE---------------- CONCEPT OF----- "SMALL MIRACLES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" SEPTEMBER------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2003 TOM---------------- SHAPIRO---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOUNDER---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACADEMY---------------- TENT---- & CANVAS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ IN-------- AUGUST, EVENT SOLUTIONS PROUDLY INDUCTED AN INAUGURAL-------- CLASS OF 10 INDUSTRY LEGENDS INTO THE EVENT INDUSTRY HALL-------- OF FAME. THIS IS THE SEVENTH IN A SERIES PROFILING EACH-------- OF THE INDUCTEES.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- B------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORN AND-------- RAISED IN CALIFORNIA, TOM SHAPIRO BEGAN HIS COLLEGE-------- CAREER IN TUCSON AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA.------------- "INITIALLY I WAS A VETERINARY MEDICINE MAJOR AT THE-------- U OF A. BUT I TRANSFERRED TO USC AFTER CREATING AN-------- EXPLOSION IN A CHEMISTRY CLASS THAT REQUIRED A BUILDING-------- TO BE EVACUATED. I DID MUCH BETTER AT USC BECAUSE I ONLY-------- STARTED A FIRE IN THE LAB THERE. A WOMAN DROPPED-------- SOMETHING ON MY SHOE WHICH CAUGHT ON FIRE-----," SAYS-------- SHAPIRO.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WITH HIS-------- PLANS FOR A CAREER IN VETERINARY MEDICINE GONE UP IN-------- SMOKE, SHAPIRO CHANGED HIS MAJOR TO BUSINESS. UPON-------- GRADUATION, SHAPIRO WORKED OPERATIONS, PRODUCTION AND-------- SALES FOR HIS FAMILY'-----S GARMENT BUSINESS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ HE THEN-------- STARTED WORK FOR A TENT COMPANY AS A PURCHASING AGENT--------, LATER TO BECOME ASSISTANT TO THE OWNER. SAYS SHAPIRO-------------, "THIS WAS PROBABLY JUST BEFORE TENTS BECAME A MAJOR-------- EVENT VENUE. THEY WERE STILL PRETTY MUCH A----- `MOM AND-------- POP'----- GARAGE INDUSTRY.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" ABOUT THREE-------- AND A HALF YEARS LATER, HE STARTED ACADEMY TENT------------ & CANVAS WITH HIS FRIEND AND PARTNER MAURY RICE.----- "WE-------- STARTED ON A SHOESTRING-----," SHAPIRO RECALLS.------------- "MAURY'-----S FATHER-IN-LAW DONATED AN OLD TRUCK TO-------- THE CAUSE. IT WAS SO OLD THAT IT DIDN'-----T HAVE ANY-------- PAINT ON IT.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" SAYS-------- SHAPIRO-----, "ONE OF OUR FIRST CUSTOMERS WAS A CATERER-------- WHO WAS DOING A ROCK STAR'-----S WEDDING. OUR TRUCK-------- CHUGGED INTO THE DRIVEWAY, AND JUST LIKE IN A CARTOON, IT-------- COLLAPSED. SMOKE STARTED BILLOWING OUT, THE TIRES WENT-------- FLAT, THE CREW JUMPED OFF THE BACK. THE CATERER RAN UP TO-------- ME AND SAID-----, `TOM, TOM, PROMISE ME EVERYTHING'-----S-------- GOING TO BE OK.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------' "WE PUT-------- THE TENT UP AND THE ROCK STAR WAS SO PLEASED SHE INVITED-------- US ALL TO ATTEND THE WEDDING.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" PROGRESSING-------- FROM THIS HUMBLE START-UP, THE 1984 OLYMPICS CREATED A-------- MAJOR----- "TIPPING POINT--------AT WHICH SHAPIRO AND---------ACADEMY PROVIDED A LOT OF TENTING. SINCE THEN, THEY HAVE-------- DONE WORK AT THREE DIFFERENT-OLYMPICS, AT SUPER BOWLS--------, AND IN FOREIGN DESTINATIONS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "WHAT I-------- AM MOST FOND-ABOUT IN OUR SUCCESS-WOULD BE THE COMPANY-------- REPUTATION, WHERE PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE IN US-------- THAT THEY TAKE US WITH THEM-----," SAYS SHAPIRO.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- REGARDING-------- THE WORK THAT PRODUCED THE GROWTH AND SUCCESS OF ACADEMY--------, AND THE HIGH ESTEEM WITH WHICH EVENT PROFESSIONALS REGARD-------- HIM, SHAPIRO SAYS WITH A SMILE-----, "I DON'-----T-------- DESERVE ANY CREDIT...BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'-----S THE-------- PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH US THAT DESERVE THE CREDIT. AS AN-------- OWNER, I GET THE CREDIT BECAUSE I HAVE THE TITLE. BUT THE-------- REALITY IS, IT'-----S REALLY THOSE PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT-------- HAPPEN.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" FIRST---------------- YEAR IN THE EVENT INDUSTRY:----------------------------- THE START OF TIME. I REMEMBER IT---------------- CLEARLY. MEL BROOKS WAS THERE. HE WAS THE OTHER---------------- GUY WHO STARTED IN THE TENT BUSINESS. BUT HE GOT---------------- OUT AND WENT INTO ENTERTAINMENT.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT---------------- I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE WHEN I GREW UP:----------------------------- I DON'-----T KNOW...SUCCESSFUL. I JUST---------------- KNEW I WANTED TO BE GOOD AT WHATEVER I DID.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BIGGEST---------------- EVENT SUCCESS:----------------------------- I THINK THAT THE BIGGEST SUCCESS WOULD---------------- BE MORE ON A GLOBAL LEVEL. AND THAT (SUCCESS----------------) WOULD BE THE REPUTATION THAT THE COMPANY HAS---------------- ACHIEVED IN PARTICULAR FOR LARGE, HIGH-PROFILE---------------- PROJECTS, LIKE THE OLYMPICS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WORST---------------- EVENT DISASTER:----------------------------- ONE YEAR WE PROVIDED A BUNCH OF TENTS---------------- FOR A SUPER BOWL PROJECT. A SQUALL WENT THROUGH---------------- TOWN AND DESTROYED A LOT OF PROPERTY AND IN THE---------------- PROCESS ABOUT HALF A DOZEN OF OUR TENTS. WE---------------- PROVIDED REPLACEMENT TENTS AND ACTUALLY SET UP---------------- SEWING MACHINES IN THE PARKING LOT TO MAKE---------------- REPAIRS. AND TWO OR THREE DAYS LATER EVERYTHING---------------- WAS BACK UP AND FINE...WE NOW HAVE STRUCTURES---------------- ENGINEERED TO WITHSTAND 70 MPH--------------------- `SQUALLS.'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MOST---------------- VALUABLE LESSON LEARNED:----------------------------- I DON'-----T KNOW THAT I COULD ISOLATE---------------- ONE PARTICULAR LESSON. I GUESS THEY ALL ADD UP TO---------------- OUR CLIENTS HAVING CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE GOING---------------- TO DO WHAT WE SAY WE WILL DO. WE CANNOT LET---------------- PEOPLE DOWN.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BEST---------------- PIECE OF ADVICE I EVER RECEIVED:----------------------------- MY FATHER ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT THE MOST---------------- IMPORTANT THING IS YOUR REPUTATION, BECAUSE THAT---------------- IS THE ONLY THING THAT YOU TAKE WITH YOU.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OCTOBER------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2003 JIM---------------- STEEG---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SENIOR---------------- VICE-PRESIDENT-------------------- OF SPECIAL EVENTS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NFL------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN-------- AUGUST 2002, EVENT SOLUTIONS PROUDLY INDUCTED AN-------- INAUGURAL CLASS OF 10 INDUSTRY LEGENDS INTO THE EVENT-------- INDUSTRY HALL OF FAME.
