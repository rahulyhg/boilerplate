NOTICE THE GOVERNMENT MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO-- ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THEY-CAN'T PRODUCE ANY DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY FROM-- THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY DELEGATING TO THE IRS THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT-- INCOME TAXES OR IT'S PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER.------ THIS OF-- COURSE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE MOTTO OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHICH IS----- "NOT-- TO GAIN A CONVICTION, BUT TO SEE JUSTICE DONE-----" IS SO MUCH BS.------ IN-- REALITY THEY REPRESENT A GREATER COLLECTION OF CRIMINALS THAN THE PEOPLE-- THEY PROSECUTE.---------------------------------------------------- HERE ARE THE------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EXHIBITS FROM THAT GO WITH MY LATEST MOTION ABOVE-----,---- "MOTION TO DISMISS-- SINCE THIS COURT CANNOT HAVE JURISDICTION SINCE THE INDICTMENT FAILS TO-- CHARGE AN OFFENSE-----" FILED JULY------------------------------------------------------------- 5, THE FOLLOWING WILL PROVIDE- EXTENSIVE AND IRREFUTABLE PROOF OF HOW FEDERAL JUDGES AND THE DEPT. OF----- "JUSTICE-----" LAWYERS- KNOWINGLY VIOLATE THE LAW IN ORDER TO CONVICT DEFENDANTS (ILLEGALLY) CHARGED- WITH INCOME TAX CRIMES,------ AND WHY ONLY MIS-STATEMENTS OF- LAW EVER----- "COMES FROM THE BENCH-----" AT SUCH TRIALS.------------------------------------------------- SINCE THE INCOME TAX WAS REPEALED IN 1954 WHEN- CONGRESS ADOPTED THE 1954 CODE, IT IS CLEAR THAT FOR 50 YEARS FEDERAL JUDGES IN- CONSPIRACY WITH U. S. DEPARTMENT OF INJUSTICE PROSECUTORS HAVE BEEN ILLEGALLY- AND CRIMINALLY PROSECUTING PEOPLE FOR CRIMES THAT DO NOT EXIST IN CONNECTION- WITH A TAX THAT NOBODY OWES.-------------------------------------------- THEREFORE, THE FACT THAT JUDGE DAWSON ALONG WITH- ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT S PROSECUTORS IN THIS CASE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN------ THE SAME- CRIMINAL CONDUCT SHOULD SURPRISE NO ONE   EXCEPT------ IN THIS CASE, THEIR CRIMINAL- CONDUCT WAS SO BLATANT AND JUDGE DAWSON S CHARGE TO THE JURY WAS SO OUTRAGEOUSLY- FALSE IN SO MANY AREAS, THAT CHANGES IN THE WAY CRIMINAL TRIALS ARE CONDUCTED IN- THE U.S. OF A. MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW FROM THESE DISCLOSURES.------------------------------------------- PURSUANT TO THE SUPREME COURT S------ DEFINITIVE- CHEEK DECISION, 498 US AT PAGE 201,------ THE GOVERNMENT IN A TAX PROSECUTION HAS- A THREE- FOLD------ BURDEN,------ IT MUST PROVE:-------------------------------------------- (1) THE LAW IMPOSED A DUTY UPON THE- DEFENDANT;-------------------------------------------- (2) THE DEFENDANT KNEW OF THAT DUTY; AND (3) HE DELIBERATELY AND- INTENTIONALLY (WILLFULLY) VIOLATED THAT DUTY.----------- NOTICE THAT THE ISSUE OF-  WILLFULNESS  ONLY ENTERS THE PICTURE IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT S THIRD- BURDEN.------------ OBVIOUSLY, A DEFENDANT HAS A RIGHT DURING THE GOVERNMENT S- PRESENTATION OF ITS CASE, TO ESTABLISH THAT NO LAW IMPOSED ANY SUCH  DUTY  UPON- HIM.------ HOWEVER TO DO THAT, THE DEFENDANT MUST BE ABLE TO RAISE THE LAW ITSELF AND- SHOW THAT NO LAW IMPOSED ANY SUCH  DUTY  UPON HIM, AND THAT THE IRS EMPLOYEES- WHO TESTIFIED FOR THE GOVERNMENT, HAD NO LEGAL AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT THEY- TESTIFIED THEY DID.-------------------------------------------- IF THE DEFENDANT CAN ESTABLISH THESE CLAIMS DURING THE- GOVERNMENT S PRESENTATION OF ITS CASE, AND KNOCK OUT ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT S IRS- WITNESSES (WHICH CAN EASILY BE DONE BY INTRODUCING INTO EVIDENCE THEIR JOB- DESCRIPTIONS, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SECTION 7608, AND THE NATURE OF THEIR  POCKET- COMMISSIONS- ) THE DEFENDANT WOULD BE ENTITLED TO A DIRECT VERDICT OF ACQUITTAL AT THE CLOSE OF- THE GOVERNMENT S PRESENTATION OF ITS CASE, WITHOUT THE DEFENDANT EVEN HAVING TO- PUT ON A DEFENSE, LARGELY BASED ON THE ISSUE OF  WILLFULNESS.  THEREFORE, HOW DID JUDGE DAWSON PREVENT ME FROM- PROVING THAT NO INCOME TAX LAW IMPOSED A  DUTY  UPON ME, AND THAT I KNEW OF SUCH- A  DUTY    THEREBY SPARING THE GOVERNMENT THE NEED OF HAVING TO PROVE THESE- FIRST TWO ELEMENTS OF ITS BURDEN, WHILE PREVENTING ME FROM PROVING THAT NONE OF- THE GOVERNMENT S IRS WITNESSES HAD ANY LEGAL AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT THEY TESTIFIED- THEY DID. JUDGE DAWSON SOUGHT TO ACCOMPLISHED THESE TASKS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS.-------------------------------------------- THE FIRST WAY WAS TO PREVENT ME FROM BRINGING UP THE LAW ITSELF, BY CONTINUALLY- CLAIMING THAT  THE LAW WILL COME FROM THE BENCH. HOW COULD I PROVE THAT NO  LAW  IMPOSED ANY  DUTY  UPON ME (AND THEREFORE I-  KNEW  OF------ SUCH A  DUTY ) IF I COULD NOT BRING UP THE LAW ITSELF?------------------ IN FACT- WHEN I ASKED JUDGE DAWSON, IF THE GOVERNMENT INTENDED TO PUT ON A WITNESS WHO- WOULD TESTIFY THAT THE LAW IMPOSED A  DUTY  UPON ME TO PAY INCOME TAXES,------ DAVID IGNALL, THE GOVERNMENT-S LEAD PROSECUTOR, SPECIFICALLY STATED THAT THE- GOVERNMENT HAD NO SUCH INTENTION OF DOING SO, BUT WOULD RELY ON THE JUDGE- DAWSON S JURY INSTRUCTIONS TO ESTABLISH THESE ELEMENTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT.------------- HOWEVER, SINCE I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO CROSS-EXAMINE JUDGE DAWSON CONCERNING- HIS JURY INSTRUCTIONS, HE WOULD BE FREE TO MISSTATE THE LAW (HE LITERALLY THREW ALL LAW OUT THE WINDOW AS HE MISSTATED IT AT LEAST TWO DOZEN TIMES-   AND SUCH EXAMPLES WILL FOLLOW) AS HE FABRICATED A  DUTY  THAT DID NOT EXIST.-------------------------------------------- LATER, AT A HEARING (CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY) INVOLVING HIS- PROPOSED JURY INSTRUCTIONS,------------ I SPECIFICALLY POINTED OUT TO HIM HOW NUMEROUS OF- HIS PROPOSED JURY INSTRUCTION MISSTATED THE LAW - BUT HE GAVE THOSE INSTRUCTIONS- ANYWAY, ALTHOUGH HE DID CHANGE A FEW, WHILE HE REFUSED TO GIVE JURY INSTRUCTIONS- THAT CORRECTLY STATED THE LAW.------------ SINCE MY OBJECTIONS AND CORRECTIONS WERE- RECORDED AT THAT TIME--THEY WILL PROVE THAT-JUDGE DAWSON KNEW HE WAS MISSTATING- THE LAW TO THE JURY, IF MY OBJECTIONS-ARE NOT-EDITED OUT OF THE TRANSCRIPT.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- APART FROM ALREADY EXPLAINING WHY THE ACTIONS OF- JUDGE DAWSON AND THE PROSECUTORS CONSTITUTED CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS OF 18 U.S.C.- 241 IN THE 12 PAGE MOTION I FILED ON JULY 5, 2005 (AND WHICH IS POSTED IMMEDIATELY- ABOVE THIS DOCUMENT) THEIR CRIMINAL CULPABILITY WAS SUBSTANTIALLY EXTENDED AT- TRIAL AND WOULD NOW INCLUDE THE CRIME OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE   AS THE- FOLLOWING WILL DEMONSTRATE.------------------------------------------------------ 1)----- JUDGE DAWSON WOULD NOT ALLOW ME- TO BRING UP THE LAW, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WOULD IMPEACH THE TESTIMONY OF- GOVERNMENT WITNESSES. FOR EXAMPLE:---------------------------------------------------------------------- A)------ A GOVERNMENT WITNESS, WITH A VERY- IMPRESSIVE TITLE, WAS INTRODUCED AS BEING IN CHARGE OF THE FRIVOLOUS PENALTY- PROGRAM IN THE 9TH CIRCUIT AREA.------------ SHE TESTIFIED THAT THE IRS IMPOSED- THE $500 FRIVOLOUS PENALTY BASED UPON GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGAL- COUNSEL FOR THE IRS, AND WHEN THE IRS RECEIVED A TAX RETURN THAT FELL WITHIN- THOSE GUIDELINES, THEY IMPOSED THE $500 FRIVOLOUS PENALTY.------ I OBJECTED TO HER- TESTIMONY AS HEARSAY, SINCE SHE WAS NOT THE ONE WHO DETERMINED WHETHER A RETURN- WAS FRIVOLOUS OR NOT, AND WHAT SHE WAS TOLD BY THE IRS DISTRICT COUNSEL- CONSTITUTED HEARSAY.-------------------------------------------- I STATED THAT IT WAS THE IRS DISTRICT COUNSEL WHO SHOULD- BE TESTIFYING CONCERNING WHAT CONSTITUTED A  FRIVOLOUS  RETURN, SINCE HE WAS- APPARENTLY THE ONE WHO MADE THAT DETERMINATION AND NOT THE WITNESS WHO WAS NOW- TESTIFYING.------ BUT MY OBJECTION WAS OVERRULED.------------ WHEN I CROSS-EXAMINED HER, I- SPECIFICALLY ASKED HER WHETHER OR NOT ANY IRS AGENT TOOK SPECIFIC RE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SPONSIBILITY FOR IMPOSING THES PENALTY.F SHEE SAID  NO,  THAT WAS NOT HOW IT WAS DONE.------ I THEN ASKED HER IF SHE WAS FAMILIAR--WITH CODE SECTION 67---I FORGOT WHETHER SHE SAID  YES  OR  NO.  IN ANY CASE I- ASKED HER,  IF YOU SAW A COPY OF IR CODE SECTION 6751, WOULD THAT REFRESH YOUR- RECOLLECTION?  SHE MUST HAVE SAID,  YES,  SINCE I NOW MOVED TO ADMIT SECTION- 6751 INTO EVIDENCE.-------------------------------------------- I HANDED A COPY OF SECTION 6751 TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY WHO WAS- SITTING RIGHT IN BACK OF ME. HE READ IT, BUT APPEARED TO HAVE A PUZZLED LOOK- ON HIS FACE, WHEN HE SAID,  NO OBJECTION.  I THEN HANDED THE DOCUMENT TO THE- CLERK, SO IT COULD BE MARKED AS AN EXHIBIT, AND SHE HANDED IT UP TO JUDGE- DAWSON, WHO PROCEEDED TO READ IT.------------ HE READ:------  NO PENALTY UNDER THIS TITLE SHALL- BE ASSESSED UNLESS THE INITIAL DETERMINATION OF SUCH ASSESSMENT IS PERSONALLY- APPROVED (IN WRITING) BY THE IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL MAKING SUCH- DETERMINATION OR SUCH HIGHER LEVEL OFFICIAL AS THE SECRETARY MAY DESIGNATE.-------------  JUDGE DAWSON, OF COURSE, REALIZED THAT SECTION 6751 (WHICH PROVIDED THAT A- DOCUMENT CONTAINING AT LEAST TWO SIGNATURES WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR THE- FRIVOLOUS PENALTY TO BE IMPOSED) TOTALLY IMPEACHED THE TESTIMONY OF THE- GOVERNMENT S WITNESS THEN SITTING BEFORE HIM.------ THEREFORE, HE SOUGHT TO SAVE THE- GOVERNMENT S WITNESS FROM BEING TOTALLY DISCREDITED BY SAYING:------------  WELL, COURTS- HAVE HELD (OF COURSE, HE NEVER NAMED WHAT COURTS) THAT THIS PROVISION IS NOT- REALLY BINDING ON THE IRS------ (OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT),------------ SO THIS DOCUMENT IS- IRRELEVANT AND WILL NOT BE ADMITTED.--------------------------------------------  SO, JUDGE DAWSON WOULD NOT ALLOW THE- LAW, SECTION 6751,------ TO BE ADMITTED, SINCE IT WOULD ALLOW ME TO USE IT TO- DISCREDIT THE ENTIRE TESTIMONY OF THIS IMPRESSIVELY TITLED,------ GOVERNMENT- WITNESS.------ SINCE SHE ALSO STATED (IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH HER ALLEGED CREDENTIALS-, EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT QUALIFY HER AS AN  EXPERT )------ THAT SHE HAD TESTIFIED EXTENSIVELY AT BOTH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL TRIALS. IT IS-, THEREFORE, APPARENT THAT AT ALL SUCH TRIALS HER TESTIMONY WAS IN DIRECT CONFLICT- WITH THE LAW   UNFORTUNATELY DEFENDANTS AT SUCH TRIALS WOULD PROBABLY BE UNAWARE- OF THAT FACT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- B)------ ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S FIRST WITNESSES WAS- RETIRED SPECIAL AGENT TED WETHJE.------ HE IS MENTIONED IN THE FEDERAL MAFIA ON PAGES- 221, 222, AND 224 . THE GOVERNMENT LARGELY RELIED ON HIS PERJURED TESTIMONY TO- GAIN MY INDICTMENT AND CONVICTION IN 1985 AND THEREFORE SOUGHT TO USE THIS- EXPERIENCED AND UNCONSCIONABLE LIAR AT THIS TRIAL.------ HE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO LEGAL- AUTHORITY TO TESTIFY AT EITHER MY 1985 TRIAL OR AT THIS TRIAL, SINCE HE HAS NO- MORE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE-THE PAYMENT OF INCOME TAXES THAN THE MAN IN THE MOON.------- HE IS PRECLUDED FROM-DOING SO BY HIS OWN JOB DESCRIPTION (EXHIBIT A) AND BECAUSE- HE FALLS INTO SUBSECTION (A) OF PROVISION 7608 (EXHIBIT C).------------ ANY IRS AGENT WHO- CLAIMS HE IS LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO CARRY A FIREARM MUST FALL INTO SUBSECTION (A-) OF SECTION 7608, SINCE AGENTS WHO FALL INTO SUBSECTION (B) ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO-  CARRY FIREARMS.------------  SO, IF SPECIAL AGENT WETHJE WAS AUTHORIZED TO  CARRY- FIREARMS  DURING HIS EMPLOYMENT WITH THE IRS, HE COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED- TO ENFORCE THE PAYMENT OF LIQUOR, TOBACCO, AND FIREARMS TAXES AND SUCH OTHER- TAXES AS FALL WITHIN THE PROVISIONS OF SUBTITLE E OF THE IR CODE   AND NOT- INCOME TAXES, WHICH FALL WITHIN-SUBTITLE A OF THE IR-CODE.--------------------------------------------------------- SO WHEN I CROSS-EXAMINED HIM, THE FIRST THING I- SAID TO HIM WAS,  ISN T IT A FACT MR. WETHJE--THAT WHEN YOU WORKED-AT THE IRS- YOU CARRIED A FIREARM?------------  THE GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY OBJECTED TO THE QUESTION- (PROBABLY CITING  RELEVANCE ) AND ITS OBJECTION WAS IMMEDIATELY SUSTAINED BY- JUDGE DAWSON IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER,  SUSTAINED - MOVE ON.------  HOWEVER, I TRIED- TO ARGUE THAT WEATHER OR NOT WETHJE CARRIED A FIREARM WAS RELEVANT AS TO WHETHER- OR NOT HE WAS AUTHORIZED TO GIVE TESTIMONY AT THIS TRIAL SINCE IT INVOLVED- INCOME TAXES.------ HOWEVER, JUDGE DAWSON WOULD HEAR NONE OF IT.------ HE SUPPOSEDLY HAD- WARNED ME THAT WHEN HE SUSTAINED AN OBJECTION, I WAS NOT TO ARGUE ANY FURTHER- BUT HAD TO  MOVE ON.------  HOWEVER, I WAS ALSO UNDER THE IMPRESSION, THAT ONE HAD A- RIGHT TO ARGUE THE VALIDITY AND NECESSITY OF THE QUESTION YOU ASKED, BEFORE IT- WAS RULED UPON,------ AND IN THIS CASE (AS------ WELL AS IN NUMEROUS OTHER CASES) JUDGE- DAWSON RULED UPON THE GOVERNMENT S OBJECTION WITHOUT GIVING ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO- ARGUE WHY THE QUESTION WAS------ RELEVANT TO MY DEFENSE.-------------------------------------------- ALSO I AM HARD OF HEARING-, AND SO I MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD HIM SAY  SUSTAINED,  BUT BELIEVED I STILL HAD A- RIGHT TO ARGUE THE VALIDITY OF MY QUESTION   AND SO MIGHT HAVE RAISED ARGUMENTS--AFTER HE HAD STATED  SUSTAINED.------------  AT SUCH TIMES JUDGE DAWSON WOULD BARK,-------------  SANCTION,  WHICH MEANT I HAD JUST BEEN-HELD IN CONTEMPT OF COURT, WHICH- CARRIED A JAIL SENTENCE THAT WAS DOUBLE TO THAT METED OUT BY THE PREVIOUS- SANCTION.------ JUDGE DAWSON STARTED THE SANCTIONS AT ONE DAY IN JAIL, WHICH WERE- THEN DOUBLED FOR EACH SUCCEEDING SANCTION.------ I MUST HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST A- DOZEN SANCTIONS.------ IN ANY CASE, HE ALSO WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO ME BRING UP WETHJE S JOB DESCRIPTION, WHICH ALSO SHOWED THAT WETHJE HAD NO AUTHORITY TO- INVESTIGATE ANYBODY LIVING WITHIN THE CONTINENTAL U.S.A. IN CONNECTION WITH- INCOME TAXES, AND SO HE HAD NO AUTHORITY TO BE TESTIFYING AT THIS TRIAL.------ IN- THIS MANNER JUDGE DAWSON KNOWINGLY ALLOWED THE GOVERNMENT TO USE WITNESSES- AGAINST ME WHO HE KNEW HAD ABSOLUTELY NO AUTHORITY TO TESTIFY AT MY TRIAL.------------------------------------------------------------------ C.------ ANOTHER GOVERNMENT WITNESS-, REVENUE------ OFFICER LUDDIE TALLEY TESTIFIED THAT HE WAS INVOLVED (AT VARIOUS TIMES-) IN SEIZING NUMEROUS ITEMS FROM ME------ INCLUDING: AN AUTOMOBILE,-MONIES TAKEN FROM- ME WHICH WERE BEING HELD FOR ME AT THE CLARK COUNTY JAIL, AND 100% OF MY MONTHLY- SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFIT.------ HE HAD SENT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION A- FRAUDULENT, IRS NOTICE-OF- LEVY------ (WHICH HE HAD NO AUTHORITY TO SEND OUT, AND- WHICH IS TOTALLY BENIGN AND CAN BE IMMEDIATELY THROWN INTO THE NEAREST TRASH- CAN) ON WHICH HE HAD ADDED, IN HIS OWN HANDWRITING,  FULL LEVY ;------ A TERM THAT- APPEARS NO PLACE IN------ THE LAW GOVERNING  NOTICES-OF-LEVY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  WHEN I ASKED TALLEY,  ARE YOU AWARE OF IRS POCKET COMMISSIONS?,------  THE- GOVERNMENT CRIED OUT,  OBJECTION,  WHICH JUDGE DAWSON  SUSTAINED  AS USUAL.------------- HOWEVER, HAD I BEEN PERMITTED TO PROCEED WITH THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING, IT WOULD- HAVE PROCEEDED AS FOLLOWS.------ TALLEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO ANSWER,  YES  TO MY INITIAL- QUESTION. BASED ON THAT ANSWER,------ I------ WOULD THEN HAVE SAID,  AND THEY CONSIST OF- ENFORCEMENT AND NON-ENFORCEMENT COMMISSIONS, DO THEY NOT?------  AND HE WOULD HAVE- HAD TO SAY,  YES.------  AND THEN I-WOULD HAVE SAID,  AND WHAT KIND OF A POCKET- COMMISSION DO YOU HAVE?------------  AND HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO SAY,  A NON-ENFORCEMENT- POCKET COMMISSION.------------  AND THEN I WOULD HAVE SAID,  THEREFORE, YOU HAVE NO- ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WITH RESPECT TO INCOME TAXES, ISN T THAT CORRECT?------  IN- ORDER NOT TO COMMIT PERJURY, HE WOULD HAVE HAD-TO ANSWER,  CORRECT.-------   THEREFORE,  I WOULD HAVE SAID,  YOU HAD NO LAWFUL AUTHORITY TO SEIZE MY- AUTOMOBILE, THE MONEY BEING HELD FOR ME AT THE-CLARK COUNTY JAIL, OR MY MONTHLY- SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK, ISN T THAT CORRECT?------------  AND HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO ANSWER-,  CORRECT.------  AND THEN I WOULD HAVE SAID,  SO YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN AN ORDINARY- THIEF, EXCEPT YOU OPERATE UNDER COLOR OF LAW, ISN T THAT CORRECT?  AND HE WOULD- HAVE HAD TO ANSWER,  CORRECT.------  EXCEPT I WOULD HAVE CORRECTED HIM, BY SAYING.-------  NO, YOU ARE WORSE THAN AN ORDINARY THIEF. ORDINARY THIEVES AT LEAST DON T HAVE- THE GALL TO PRETEND THAT THEIR STEALING IS LEGAL, AND THEY, AT LEAST, TAKE SOME- RISK.------ THEY DON T HAVE FEDERAL JUDGES AND U.S.-ATTORNEYS PROTECTING-THEM.------- BECAUSE OF THE HYPOCRISY IN YOUR BRAND OF THIEVERY,------ AND BECAUSE IT RECEIVES THE- PROTECTION OF THE COURTS AND THE DOJ,------ IT MUST BE REGARDED AS A LOWER FORM OF- THIEVERY THEN THAT COMMITTED BY ORDINARY CRIMINALS.------------  HOWEVER, I NEVER GOT THE- CHANCE TO PROCEED ALONG THOSE LINES, SINCE I WAS PREVENTED FROM DOING SO BY- JUDGE DAWSON.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN ADDITION, WHEN I ASKED TALLEY,  WHEN YOU- SEIZE PROPERTY DO YOU DO IT LEGALLY OR ILLEGALLY?  HE RESPONDED BY SAYING,  I DO- IT LEGALLY.------  THIS LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR MY NEXT QUESTION, WHICH WAS,  DID YOU- EVER SEE A STATUTE THAT ALLOWED THE IRS TO SEIZE PROPERTY?  HOWEVER, BEFORE HE- COULD ANSWER, THE GOVERNMENT OBJECTED AND JUDGE DAWSON GAVE HIS USUAL-  SUSTAINED.------------  IF TALLEY HAD SAID  YES,  TO THAT QUESTION, I WOULD HAVE HANDED- HIM THE CODE AND ASKED HIM TO SHOW ME THE STATUTE THAT ALLOWED HIM TO SEIZE- PROPERTY LEGALLY, AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND SUCH A STATUTE,------- BECAUSE IT DOESN T EXIST.------ IF HE SAID  NO,  I WOULD HAVE ASKED,  THEN HOW DO- YOU KNOW YOU SEIZE PROPERTY LEGALLY?------  SO NO MATTER HOW TALLEY------ ANSWERED,------ I- WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPOSE THE FACT THAT IRS AGENTS HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO- SEIZE PROPERTY.-------BUT, AGAIN, THE GOVERNMENT S PROSECUTORS AND JUDGE DAWSON- INTERCEDED IN ORDER TO PREVENT ME FROM PROVING THAT ALL IRS SEIZURES ARE- ILLEGAL, AND NOT PROVIDED FOR BY LAW.---------------------------------------------------------------- FURTHER I PRODUCED A DOCUMENT SENT OUT BY THE SOCIAL-- SECURITY ADMINISTRATION THAT SHOWED THAT THE SEIZURE OF SOCIAL SECURITY-- BENEFITS BY THE IRS IS------ LIMITED TO 15% (ASSUMING THEY HAVE ANY SEIZURE-- AUTHORITY AT ALL, WHICH THEY DO NOT HAVE.)------ HOWEVER BASED UPON-- ERRONEOUS REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT, JUDGE DAWSON INSTRUCTED-- THE JURY THAT THE LAW ALLOWED THE IRS TO SEIZE 100% OF MY MONTHLY BENEFIT.-------------- THAT WAS DEAD WRONG, BUT EXPLAINING IT TO THE JURY-WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO --COMPLICATED, BESIDES I HAD A BETTER WAY TO DO IT.------ I WAS CALLING AS A-- WITNESS DR. RAYMOND HARTMAN OF BEAVER FALLS, PENNSYLVANIA.------------------------------------------------------------------- HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE MOVEMENT EVEN PREDATES MINE --SEE PAGE----OF  THE FEDERAL MAFIA. ).------ WHEN HE TOLD-ME THE IRS WAS TAKING- 100% OF HIS SOCIAL SECURITY, I PROVIDED HIM WITH INFORMATION WHICH HE SENT TO THE- SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION.------------ SHORTLY THEREAFTER THEY SENT HIM A REFUND OF- APPROXIMATELY $9,------000 AND RESTORED 100% OF HIS MONTHLY BENEFIT.------------ SINCE I HAD TO- SUPPLY JUDGE DAWSON WITH AN OUTLINE OF WHAT MY WITNESSES WERE GOING TO TESTIFY- ABOUT, HE INFORMED ME THAT HE WOULD NOT PERMIT DR. HARTMAN TO TESTIFY ABOUT- GETTING HIS SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS RESTORED.------ WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY, HE SAID- THAT SUCH TESTIMONY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH INCOME TAXES.------------ I AM SURE THAT THE- FACT THAT DR.------ HARTMAN S------ TESTIMONY WOULD ALSO REFUTE WHAT JUDGE DAWSON HAD TOLD- THE JURY CONCERNING THE IRS S LEGAL AUTHORITY TO SEIZE 100% OF MY SOCIAL- SECURITY BENEFITS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS DECISION..------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (D) ALONG THE SAME LINES, THE GOVERNMENT S SUMMARY  EXPERT,  IRS- AGENT- CLINTON LOWDER TESTIFIED EXTENSIVELY- CONCERNING DEPOSITS TO MY BANK ACCOUNTS WHICH HE CLAIMED REVEALED THAT- SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY HAD BEEN DEPOSITED TO MY  EIGHT BANK ACCOUNTS------  IN- CONNECTION WITH THE YEARS AT ISSUE.- WHEN I HAD PREVIOUSLY INQUIRED ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF ALL HIS TESTIMONY REGARDING------- THESE BANK DEPOSITS, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED THAT IT WAS RELATED TO HOW MUCH-  INCOME  I HAD RECEIVED DURING THIS PERIOD.------ I SAID, NO IT DIDN T.------------ I POINTED- OUT THAT IT MERELY INDICATED HOW MUCH MONEY I HAD DEPOSITED TO MY BANK ACCOUNTS- AND NOTHING MORE,------ AND DEPOSITING MONEY TO ONES BANK ACCOUNT IS NOT A CRIME-   NOR HAD I BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY SUCH CRIME.------ SUCH DEPOSITS MIGHT BE RELATED TO A- CRIME IF I HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH MONEY LAUNDERING, OR SELLING PRODUCTS THAT WERE- ILLEGAL.------ I FURTHER POINTED OUT THAT SUCH------ BANK DEPOSITS COULD------ NOT BE- CONSIDERED AS BEING INDICATIVE OF THE RECEIPT OF------  INCOME  UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT- PUT ON AN  EXPERT  IN THE LAW, WHO WOULD TESTIFY (AND BE SUBJECT TO- CROSS-EXAMINATION) THAT DEPOSITS TO ONES BANK ACCOUNTS CONSTITUTED THE RECEIPT- OF  INCOME  WITHIN THE MEANING OF CODE SECTION---- SINCE THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT- PUT ON ANY SUCH  EXPERT  WITNESS (SINCE THEY KNEW I WOULD HAVE EATEN THEM UP- ALIVE) THEY COULD NOT LEGALLY CLAIM THAT MERE BANK DEPOSITS CONSTITUTED   TO ANY DEGREE------------- THE RECEIPT OF  INCOME  WITHIN THE MEANING OF CODE- SECTION---------------- BUT JUDGE DAWSON (ILLEGALLY) DID SO ANYWAY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN ADDITION, WHEN I CROSS-EXAMINED MR. LOWDER------ I ASKED HIM,  ISN T- THE PURPOSE OF YOUR ANALYSIS OF MY BANK DEPOSITS AN ATTEMPT ON YOUR PART TO- ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF INCOME TAXES YOU BELIEVE I------ OMITTED FROM THE TAX RETURNS- I FILED FOR THE YEARS AT ISSUE?------  I ACTUALLY HAD TO REPEAT THAT QUESTION THREE- OR FOUR TIMES BEFORE I GOT A STRAIGHT ANSWER FROM HIM.------------ WHEN HE FINALLY- ADMITTED THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF HIS ACTIVITY,------ I ASKED:------  ISN T IT A FACT THAT- SECTION 6201(2) (A) GIVES THE SECRETARY THE AUTHORITY TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF- TAXES THAT HAVE BEEN OMITTED TO BE PAID BY STAMP, BUT NO LAW- AUTHORIZES THE SECRETARY (OR THE IRS) TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES THAT HAS- BEEN OMITTED FROM AN INCOME TAX RETURN?------   OBJECTION! HE IS- RAISING THE LAW, YOUR HONOR.------------------   SUSTAINED. MOVE ON.------------------   BUT YOUR HONOR, I- ASKED THAT QUESTION MERELY TO SHOW THAT THE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW MR. LOWDER TO DO- WHAT HE CLAIMS HE WAS DOING.   MR. SCHIFF: YOU HAVE DELIBERATELY VIOLATED MY- ORDER THAT YOU ARE NOT TO RAISE ISSUES OF LAW, NOR ARGUE WITH ME WHEN I SUSTAIN- A GOVERNMENT OBJECTION; THEREFORE, YOU WILL BE SANCTIONED FOR DOING SO.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  OF------ COURSE, NO LAW AUTHORIZES THE IRS (NOR THE GOVERNMENT AT- CRIMINAL TAX TRIALS) TO ATTRIBUTE TO ANYONE MORE IN INCOME TAXES THAN WHAT THEY- REPORTED ON THEIR TAX RETURNS.------ THEREFORE, SEEKING TO PURSUE ANOTHER TACK, I- SAID,  MR. LOWDER, WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE A PERSONS VARIOUS SOURCES OF- INCOME AND POSSIBLE DEDUCTIONS AND SEEK TO CALCULATE A TAX THAT IS DIFFERENT- FROM WHAT THAT TAXPAYER REPORTED ON HIS RETURN, DO YOU DO THAT LEGALLY OR- ILLEGALLY?------   I DO IT LEGALLY  HE IMMEDIATELY REPLIED.------------ I WAS THEREFORE POISED- FOR MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION.  MR. LAWDER, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A STATUTE THAT- AUTHORIZED YOU TO CALCULATE A TAX THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT A TAXPAYER- REPORTED ON HIS RETURN?------------   OBJECTION------   SUSTAINED    BUT YOUR HONOR, I WAS- ONLY ..  SANCTION. YOU ARE DELIBERATELY DOING IT AGAIN.--------------------------------------------------------  IN THIS WAY, JUDGE DAWSON IN CRIMINAL COLLUSION- WITH THE GOVERNMENT,------ SOUGHT TO PREVENT ME FROM PROVING THAT NO LAW AUTHORIZED- EITHER THE IRS,------ SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY (OR HIS DELEGATE), OR THE JUSTICE- DEPARTMENT IN THIS PROSECUTION,------ TO CLAIM THAT I OWED------ MORE IN INCOME TAXES THAN- WHAT I HAD REPORTED ON MY  ZERO  RETURNS FOR ALL OF THE YEARS AT ISSUE.------------------------------------------------------------------ (F)----------- THEREFORE,------ DURING THE- PRESENTATION OF ITS CASE THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT PUT ON ONE WITNESS WHO WOULD- TESTIFY THAT I HAD ANY  INCOME  OR INCOME TAX  LIABILITY  FOR ANY OF THE YEARS- AT ISSUE, OR THAT ANYTHING (NOT ONE WORD, SENTENCE, OR PHRASE)------ IN ANY OF MY- BOOKS AND TAPES (INCLUDING MY  ZERO  RETURN) VIOLATED ANY LAW OR ENCOURAGED- ANYONE TO VIOLATE ANY LAW   THOUGH SUCH ALLEGATIONS WERE CONTAINED THROUGHOUT- THE INDICTMENT.------ AND THOUGH THEY HAD UNDERCOVER AGENTS AT BOTH OF MY LAST- SEMINARS (A TWO DAY SEMINAR HELD IN LAS VEGAS AND A ONE DAY SEMINAR HELD IN NEW- YORK CITY) THEY PLAYED NO EXCERPTS FROM EITHER SEMINAR AS SHOWING I HAD- ADVOCATED VIOLATIONS OF LAW AT EITHER SEMINAR   THOUGH SUCH ALLEGATIONS WERE- CONTAINED IN INDICTMENT.----------------------------------------------------------- AND NO LESS THAN------ SIX------ GOVERNMENT WITNESSES TESTIFIED THAT THEY COULD FIND NO- LAW------ THAT MADE THEM  LIABLE  FOR INCOME TAXES,------ OR REQUIRED THEM  TO PAY  INCOME- TAXES, AND AT LEAST FOUR OF THEM TESTIFIED THAT THEY BELIEVED  INCOME,  WITHIN------- THE MEANING OF THE IR CODE,------ MEANT------  CORPORATE PROFIT.------  IN ADDITION,------ ALL THREE- OF MY FORMER EMPLOYEES WHO WERE WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION TESTIFIED THAT AT NO TIME DID THEY, NOR ANY OF MY OTHER EMPLOYEES, EVER- BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THE MATERIAL SOLD AND SENT OUT BY FREEDOM BOOKS------ ENCOURAGED- ANYONE TO VIOLATE ANY LAW,------ NOR DID I EVER GIVE THEM ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT- I DID------ NOT HOLD MY BELIEFS ON TAXES OTHER THAN------ SINCERELY AND HONESTLY.------------ IN------- SHORT,------ THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT PRESENT A SCINTILLA OF EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT ANY OF- ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN ITS INDICTMENT AND WE------ SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A DIRECT- VERDICT OF ACQUITTAL AT THE CLOSE OF THE GOVERNMENT S CASE.------------------------------------------------------------ HOW JUDGE DAWSON SOUGHT TO- OBSTRUCT JUSTICE BY PREVENTING------ ME FROM PUTTING ON A DEFENSE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- JUDGE DAWSON SOUGHT TO PREVENT ME FROM PUTTING ON AN EFFECTIVE- DEFENSE, BY:----------------------------------------------- (1)------------ PREVENTING ME FROM CALLING- WITNESSES WHOSE TESTIMONY WAS CRUCIAL TO MY DEFENSE;----------------------------------------------- (2)------------ PREVENTING ME FROM TESTIFYING IN- THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER;------------------------------------------------- (3)------------ BY BLATANTLY MISSTATING THE LAW IN- HIS JURY INSTRUCTIONS, AND------------------------------------------------- (4)------------ BY REFUSING TO GIVE A PROPER JURY- INSTRUCTION ON THE MEANING OF  INCOME  AND BY REFUSING TO GIVE A JURY- INSTRUCTION THAT WAS FAVORABLE TO MY DEFENSE.-------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FACT THAT JUDGE DAWSON WOULD ACTUALLY PREVENT ME FROM CALLING WITNESSES- WHOSE TESTIMONY WAS MATERIAL TO MY DEFENSE WAS TOTALLY SHOCKING TO MANY OF THOSE- WHO ATTENDED MY TRIAL, AS WELL AS THE WITNESSES WHO WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO- TESTIFY IN THE MANNER WE HAD INTENDED.------------ FOR EXAMPLE, A KEY------ THEME THAT WAS- REPEATED THROUGHOUT THE INDICTMENT WAS THAT I HAD PREPARED  FALSE AND FRAUDULENT- DOCUMENTS  AND GAVE TAX ADVICE TO PEOPLE WHICH I  WELL KNEW AND BELIEVED  WAS- FALSE.------------ SUCH CLAIMS MADE TO THE GRAND JURY D.O.J. PROSECUTORS KNEW WERE FALSE-, BUT THEY WANTED TO GET AN IN INDICTMENT AND DIDN T CARE HOW MANY LIES THEY HAD- TO TELL TO THE GRAND JURY TO GET IT.------------ PROOF OF THIS IS THAT AT TRIAL, NO- GOVERNMENT WITNESS TESTIFIED THAT ANYTHING I SAID OR WROTE ABOUT WAS UNTRUE-   LET ALONE THAT I BELIEVED IT WAS UNTRUE------------------------------------------------------- AT- TRIAL, I CALLED AS AN ADVERSE WITNESS SPECIAL AGENT------ SAM HOLLAND, WHO WAS THE- MAN MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING THE INDICTMENT.------ HE WAS THE ONE WHO- ILLEGALLY GOT THE SEARCH WARRANT WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY HIS SEALED AFFIDAVIT ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MR. HOLLAND ACCUSED ME OF FILING  FALSE AND FRAUDULENT INCOME TAX--RETURNS,  AND OF  ENCOURAGING  OTHERS TO DO THE SAME, AND------  INSTRUCTING  AND-  ASSISTING  OTHERS TO FILE FRAUDULENT FORMS W-4.------  IN THE FEDERAL MAFIA- I EXPLAIN HOW TO DO BOTH.------ SO, IF MY INSTRUCTION WERE FALSE, THAT------ COULD EASILY- BE ESTABLISHED BY TURNING TO WHERE SUCH DOCUMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE- FEDERAL MAFIA.------------------ HOWEVER, WHEN I CALLED SAM HOLLAND TO THE STAND AS AN- ADVERSE WITNESS AND------------ I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD READ THE FEDERAL MAFIA-------, HE SAID  NO.  I HAD TO ASK HIM THAT QUESTION BEFORE I COULD ASK HIM ANY QUESTION- ABOUT THAT BOOK.------ IF HE HAD ANSWERED  YES,  MY NEXT QUESTION WOULD HAVE BEEN-,  CAN YOU TURN TO ANY STATEMENT IN THAT BOOK THAT MISSTATES THE LAW OR ENCOURAGES- ANYONE TO VIOLATE THE LAW?------  HOWEVER, I COULDN T ASK HIM THAT QUESTION, BECAUSE- HE NOW CLAIMED------ HE HAD NEVER READ THAT BOOK------------------! HERE IS THE- GOVERNMENT S LEAD INVESTIGATOR SUPPOSEDLY GATHERING EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT ALL OF- THE CHARGES IN THE INDICTMENT,------ AND HE CLAIMS NOT TO HAVE READ A BOOK OF MINE- THAT THE GOVERNMENT ENJOINED ME FROM SELLING BECAUSE IT PROMOTED VIOLATIONS OF- OUR TAX LAWS   AND HE CLAIMS NOT TO HAVE THAT BOOK??------!!! HE UNDOUBTEDLY POURED OVER IT, BUT------ COULDN T FIND ANYTHING IN IT THAT WAS UNTRUE- OR ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO VIOLATE THE LAW.------ THEREFORE, HE HAD TO GIVE THAT ABSURD- AND UNBELIEVABLE ANSWER IN ORDER TO AVOID HIS TOTAL EMBARRASSMENT IF HE WERE- FORCED TO ANSWER WHAT HE KNEW WAS GOING TO BE MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION.------------------------------------------------------- IN- ADDITION WHILE HE WAS ON THE WITNESS STAND I PLACE A  ZERO  RETURN IN FRONT OF- HIM AND ASKED HIM TO IDENTIFY ONE STATEMENT ON IT THAT WAS FALSE, AND HE WAS- UNABLE TO DO SO.------ I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT OBJECTED TO MY EVEN ASKING HIM TO- SO.--------------------------------------------------- THE POINT IS, A CLAIM THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO- THE GOVERNMENT S ENTIRE CASE WAS ITS CLAIM THAT I AM ESSENTIALLY A LIAR AND A- CHARLATAN AND SIMPLY DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT I SAY, WRITE AND TEACH IN CONNECTION- WITH INCOME TAXES.------------ TO REFUTE SUCH A CLAIM, I WAS PREPARED TO CALL NO LESS THAN- FIVE ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE KNOWN ME OVER THE YEARS AND MOST OF WHOM HAD REPRESENTED- ME IN VARIOUS MATTERS IN CONNECTION WITH MY STAND ON INCOME TAXES.------------ ALL OF THEM- WERE PREPARED TO TESTIFY THAT OVERLOOKING THE LEGAL VALIDITY OF MY BELIEFS ON- THE INCOME TAX,------ THEY ALL BELIEVED BEYOND ANY QUESTION THAT I HELD THOSE- BELIEFS HONESTLY AND SINCERELY.------ THEIR TESTIMONY ALONE WOULD HAVE KNOCKED THE- GOVERNMENTS CASE INTO A COCKED HAT.------ BUT JUDGE DAWSON WOULD NOT LET THEM- TESTIFY.------ SINCE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY NOEL SPAID HAD ALREADY FLOWN IN, I PUT HER- ON AS A CHARACTER WITNESS, BUT TOLD THE OTHER LAWYERS THEY NEED NOT SHOW UP-, SINCE THEY WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TESTIFY.------------------------------------------ ALSO JUDGE DAWSON WOULD NOT ALLOW THE FOLLOWING PERSONS TO TESTIFY CONCERNING- HOW THEY RELIED ON MY MATERIAL AND HOW I RELIED ON RESEARCH AND IN FORMATION- THEY SUPPLIED TO ME:----------------------------------------------- 1)------------------------ FORMER IRS SPECIAL AGENT JOE- BANNISTER----------------------------------------------- 2)------------------------ FORMER------ IRS REVENUE OFFICER------ JOHN- TURNER----------------------------------------------- 3)------------------------ BOB SCHULTZ , CHAIRMAN OF  WE THE- PEOPLE-----------------------------------------------  4)------------------------ THE GOVERNMENT S OWN CLINICAL- PSYCHOLOGIST, DANIAL S.

AND, IN- THIS CASE, EVEN PUNISHMENT HAS NOT HAD A CORRECTIVE IMPACT IN HIS THINKING OR- BEHAVIORS. HE APPEARS IMPERVIOUS TO ANY SUGGESTION THAT HE RECONSIDER HIS- CONCLUSIONS OR HIS ACTIONS, IN PART BECAUSE OF THE THOROUGH RESEARCH- HE HAS CONDUCTED WHICH HAS YIELDED EVIDENCE AND FACTS TO SUPPORT HIS- CONCLUSIONS, COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF TO BE AN-  EXPERT  WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT SUPERSEDES THAT OF ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL CLAIMING TO- HAVE EXPERTISE IN THIS SUBJECT AREA.------------------------------------------- MOST PEOPLE HAVE BELIEFS THAT HAVE A- GREATER DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY AND OPENNESS TO CHANGE THAN DOES MR. SCHIFF.------- ALTHOUGH SOME MAY HAVE BELIEFS THAT PARALLEL MR. SCHIFF S, THEY DIFFER FROM HIM- IN THAT THEY ARE UNWILLING TO JEOPARDIZE THEIR FREEDOM AND SUFFER THE- CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR BELIEFS TO THE DEGREE THAT MR. SCHIFF HAS.------------------------------------------- AS A RESULT-, IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AT THIS POINT IN HIS LIFE TO PERSUADE- HIM THAT HE IS WRONG, PARTICULARLY SINCE HE FEELS THAT THERE ARE FEW- IF ANY INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD MATCH THE BREATH AND DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE HE- APPEARS TO HAVE AS A RESULT OF THE TIME, EFFORT, FOCUS, AND INTELLECT HE HAS- DEVOTED TO THE SUBJECT.------------------------------------------- ANY ARGUMENTS AGAINST HIM ARE LIKELY TO BE SEEN BY- HIM AS NA VE AND SOPHOMORIC, AND HE IS LIKELY TO DISMANTLE ANY SUCH ARGUMENTS- QUICKLY AND HANDILY BY QUICK REFERENCE TO MATERIALS HIS OPPONENT IS UNLIKELY TO--HAVE AT THE READY FOR CONSIDERATION AND REBUTTAL.------------------------------------------ HE HOLDS THESE BELIEFS WITH SUCH CONVICTION THAT EVEN THE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES OF INCARCERATION FOR- THE REST OF HIS NATURAL LIFE FAILS TO SHAKE HIS RESOLVE.------ THIS- DOES TEND TO SET HIM APART FROM THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL HE ADAMANTLY FEELS THAT- HE HAS DISCOVERED SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE- REGARDING THIS NATION S ECONOMIC AND TAXATION PRACTICES, AND WHEREAS OTHERS WHO- ARE NOT DRIVEN BY A MOOD DISORDER MIGHT BE MORE OPEN MINDED TO ARGUMENTS, WEIGH- PERSONAL CONSEQUENCES AND ELECT NOT TO PURSUE THEIR CAMPAIGN, IRWIN SCHIFF HAS- CHOSEN A ROUTE FRAUGHT WITH SIGNIFICANT AND POSSIBLE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  HIS ANALYSIS ALONE ELIMINATED ANY CLAIM OF  WILLFULNESS  OR THAT MY- PAST CONVICTIONS WERE  NOTICE TO ME  THAT WIPED OUT  WILLFULNESS  WHICH IS WHAT------- THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUALLY REPEATED IN ITS FINAL ARGUMENT TO THE JURY.------ BOTH THE- PROSECUTORS AND JUDGE DAWSON KNEW THAT JUDGE HAYES S REPORT MADE SUCH A CLAIM- TOTALLY SPURIOUS.--------------------------------------------------- MORE TO FOLLOW:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE JOB DESCRIPTION OF SPECIAL AGENTS (EXHIBIT A) CLEARLY REVEALS THAT--- THEY HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES--- OF PERSONS RESIDING WITHIN THE CONTINENTAL USA;------ SECTION 7608 (EXHIBIT--- B) REVEALS THAT THE ONLY IRS AGENTS (SUBSECTION (B)) WHO MIGHT HAVE--- AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE PAYMENT OF INCOME TAXES [WHICH FALLS INTO--- SUBTITLE A] ARE THOSE AGENTS FROM THE  INTELLIGENCE------ DIVISION OF THE IRS--- WHOM THE SECRETARY CHARGES ETC. ETC. ETC ; HOWEVER, THE PUBLIC NEVER--- COMES IN CONTACT WITH SUCH AGENTS;------ WHILE THOSE AGENTS WHOM THE PUBLIC--- DEALS WITH, SPECIAL AGENTS AND REVENUE------ OFFICERS,------ MUST FALL INTO--- SECTION (A) AND, THEREFORE,------ CAN------ ONLY HAVE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE--- PAYMENT OF------ SUBTITLE E------ TAXES, SUCH AS LIQUOR, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS.--------------------------------------------------- WITH RESPECT TO  POCKET COMMISSIONS  (EXHIBIT C): THE IRS ISSUES TWO--- TYPES,  ENFORCEMENT  AND  NON-ENFORCEMENT------  COMMISSIONS.------ ALL IRS--- SEIZURES ARE DONE BY REVENUE OFFICERS WHO ARE ONLY ISSUED---------  NON-ENFORCEMENT  POCKET COMMISSIONS, WHICH AGAIN------ PROVES THAT THEY HAVE--- NO LEGAL AUTHORITY TO SEIZE ANYTHING, SUCH AS:------ BANK ACCOUNTS, WAGES---, AUTOMOBILES, STOCK PORTFOLIOS, ETC.

LOWDER CONTINUALLY REFERRED TO  TRANSFERS  BETWEEN------ MY  EIGHT BANK--- ACCOUNTS.------  ACTUALLY I ONLY HAD FOUR ACCOUNTS (PLUS MY PILL ACCOUNT) AT--- ANY ONE TIME.------ WHEN------ THE IRS ILLEGALLY SEIZED MY BANK ACCOUNTS WITH BANK--- OF AMERICA (AND ATM WITHDRAWALS FROM MY PILL ACCOUNT SAVED THE DAY---, BECAUSE IT ALLOWED ME TO PAY MY EMPLOYEES AND OTHER CREDITORS)------------ I--- OPENED UP ACCOUNTS WITH THE NEVADA------ STATE BANK BECAUSE THEIR DEPOSIT--- AGREEMENT SAID THEY WOULD ONLY TURN OVER DEPOSITOR FUNDS  PURSUANT TO--- LEGAL PROCESS  WHICH ELIMINATED IRS NOTICES-OF-LEVY (IF THEIR--- DIFFERENCES WERE POINTED OUT TO THEM.)--------------------------------------------------------- HOWEVER,------ THEY HAVE SINCE--- CHANGED THEIR DEPOSIT AGREEMENT TO------ MAKE IT MORE COMPATIBLE FOR THEM TO--- ILLEGALLY HONOR IRS NOTICES -OF -LEVY, WHICH DOING SO, IS STILL A--- VIOLATION OF NEVADA STATE LAW.------ IN ANY CASE, TWO OF THE FOUR ACCOUNTS--- WERE FOR THE FREEDOM FOUNDATION.------ ONE ACCOUNT WAS INTEREST BEARING, THE--- OTHER WAS NOT.------------ I KEPT FUNDS NOT IMMEDIATELY NEEDED IN THE INTEREST--- BEARING ACCOUNT, AND TRANSFERRED FUNDS TO THE NON INTEREST BEARING--- CHECKING ACCOUNT AS NEEDED.------ THE TWO ACCOUNTS I HAD FOR FREEDOM BOOKS--- CONSISTED OF A----- MERCHANT ACCOUNT AND MY GENERAL CHECKING ACCOUNT.------ THE--- MERCHANT ACCOUNT IS WHERE CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS ARE AUTOMATICALLY--- DEPOSITED BY THE COMPANY HANDLING THOSE FUNDS, WHILE CHECKS AND OTHER--- RECEIPTS ARE DEPOSITED DIRECTLY INTO THE CHECKING ACCOUNT.--------------------------------------------------- SO THERE WAS--- NOTHING DEVIOUS OR SHADY ABOUT HAVING THESE FOUR ACCOUNTS (OR THE EIGHT--- THE GOVERNMENT KEPT REFERRING TO) AS THE GOVERNMENT SOUGHT TO--- DEPICT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN ADDITION, THROUGHOUT THE INDICTMENT I AM ACCUSED OF  KNOWING AND--- BELIEVING  THAT PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING I TEACH AND WRITE ABOUT THE--- INCOME TAX I KNOW TO BE FALSE.------ CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ON APRIL 26, 2005 SCHIFF FILED A----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MOTION TO DISMISS-------, WHICH THE-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GOVERNMENT OPPOSED ON MAY---- 24, 2005 TO WHICH---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SCHIFF REPLIED ON MAY-------------------------------------------------------------- 27, ALSO--------------------------------------------------------------------------------!

THE GOVERNMENT SOUGHT TO REDUCE TO JUDGMENT ASSESSMENTS-- (WHICH I CLAIMED WERE BOTH FRAUDULENT AND TIME BARRED) IT HAD MADE AGAINST-- ME FOR THOSE YEARS.

PRO GRANTED THE GOVERNMENT ITS SUMMARY JUDGMENT. IN-- MOVING FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT THE GOVERNMENT LITERALLY BURIED ME IN A VARIETY-- OF LEGAL PLEADINGS AND DOCUMENTS, WHICH HAD TO BE ADDRESSED IF I WERE TO-- DEFEAT ITS MOTION. EVENTUALLY, I DISCOVERED THAT: (1) THE STATUTE THE-- GOVERNMENT USED TO IMPOSE THE FRAUD PENALTIES------------------------ COULD-- NOT APPLY TO ME ON--- ANY---- BASIS,------- AND (2) JUDGE PRO HAD BASED HIS-- RULING ON A LEGAL ASSUMPTION THAT SIMPLY--------------------------- COULD-- NOT APPLY IN THIS CASE-----------------------------------.------- THEREFORE--, HIS SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN MY VIEW IS--- CLEARLY VOID---- AS A MATTER OF LAW-- JUST ON THESE TWO GROUNDS------------------------ ALONE-------.

GEORGE S PRELIMINARY-- INJUNCTION,------ IT APPEARS FROM HIS ORDER AND OTHER STATEMENTS HE MADE AT THE-- PRELIMINARY HEARING THAT IF I CUT OUT CERTAIN PAGES FROM------------------------------------  THE FEDERAL MAFIA: HOW THE GOVERNMENT ILLEGALLY-- IMPOSES AND UNLAWFULLY COLLECTS INCOME TAXES,----------- I MIGHT BE ABLE TO-- SELL A SANITIZED VERSION.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- APPARENTLY BY-- ADVERTISING OTHER BOOKS AND TAPES IN THE BACK OF------ THIS BOOK I CONVERTED THE-- BOOK------ TO  COMMERCIAL SPEECH,  THUS DENYING IT----- 1ST------ AMENDMENT-- PROTECTION. (DOES THIS MAKE SENSE TO ANYBODY?)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THEREFORE, FOR NOW, FREEDOM BOOKS WILL ONLY SELL MY OTHER-- BOOKS AND SUCH RELATED BOOKS AS: (1) THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (UNLESS I AM-- ENJOINED FROM SELLING THAT TOO); (2) TITLE 28; (3) 26 C.F.R, A 5-VOLUME-- SET;------ (4) SEN. WILLIAM V. ROTH S BOOK,  THE POWER TO DESTROY  (ITS DUST-- JACKET CLAIMS THAT THE BOOK CONTAINS  SHOCKING REVELATIONS ABOUT THE-- IRS [SUCH AS]   HOW THE IRS   WITH NEAR ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY GRANTED BY-- CONGRESS   PLAYS JUDGE, JURY, AND EXECUTIONER, DEPRIVING COUNTLESS TAXPAYERS-- OF BASIC RIGHTS.)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  IT WAS ROTH S SENATE COMMITTEE THAT INVESTIGATED THE IRS IN-- 1997 AND UNCOVERED WIDE SCALE IRS ABUSE OF TAXPAYERS); AND (5) THE BOOK--  FUNDAMENTALS OF LITIGATION FOR PARALEGALS.  (INCREDIBLY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS-- PASSED A LAW THAT COMPELS ALL AMERICANS TO ACQUIRE THE LITIGATING SKILLS OF-- PROFESSIONAL LAWYERS.------ HOW ELSE CAN YOU FIGHT THE  DEPRIVATION  OF YOUR-- RIGHTS THAT SENATOR ROTH SPEAKS ABOUT?)------ I WILL ALSO STILL SELL (FOR $5.--00) MY COLOR - CODED------ GUIDE TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND-- DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.-------------- ONE CANNOT HELP BUT FEEL A TWINGE OF-- NOSTALGIA UPON READING THE CONSTITUTION, SINCE IT POIGNANTLY REMINDS US OF-- DAYS GONE BY.------ ALL OF THESE BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE ON MY-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ONLINE STORE----.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN MY APPEAL TO-- THE----- 9TH------ CIRCUIT MY LAWYER DID NOT ARGUE THE MERITS OF MY-- BELIEFS.------ HE COULD ONLY ARGUE THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT MY BOOK SAID, IT WAS-- PROTECTED BY THE----- 1ST------ AMENDMENT. IF HE ARGUED THE MERITS OF MY-- BELIEFS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY THE COURT, SINCE MY BELIEFS ARE NOT-- IN ACCORD-------------------------------------------------------- WITH WHAT-- APPELLATE COURTS HAVE RULED OUR TAX LAWS SAY, AND LAWYERS ARE APPARENTLY-- BOUND BY WHAT APPELLATE COURTS SAY THE LAW IS------   AND CANNOT ARGUE OTHERWISE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS I AM REPRESENTING MYSELF IN MY-- PENDING CRIMINAL TRIAL SINCE NO LAWYER CAN ARGUE THE MERITS (IF ANY) OF MY-- INCOME TAX BELIEFS IN FEDERAL COURTS OR THEY WILL BE SANCTIONED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ALONG THESE LINES, I CANNOT SEE HOW MY BELIEFS ON INCOME-- TAXES CAN MISLEAD ANYONE.------ APART FROM CHECKING MY BELIEFS AGAINST THE LAW-- ITSELF - WOULD I SELL THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE IF IT CONTRADICTED WHAT I-- SAY IN MY BOOKS?------ - ALL OF MY BOOKS CITE NUMEROUS COURT DECISIONS:------ OVER-- 100 SUCH DECISIONS ARE CITED IN----- "THE FEDERAL MAFIA-----" ALONE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOWEVER, NOT ONLY AM I POSTING JUDGE LLOYD D. GEORGE S ENTIRE-- 35 PAGE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION TO THIS WEBSITE (AS HE ORDERED ME TO DO--), WHICH CONTAINS HIS ANALYSIS AS TO WHY CINDY NEUN, LARRY COHEN AND MYSELF-- PREPARED  FALSE TAX RETURNS AND OTHER TAX-RELATED DOCUMENTS  (BECAUSE--)  THESE RETURNS AND DOCUMENTS FALSELY REPORT THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS HAVE NO-- TAXABLE INCOME AND NO TAX LIABILITY.  (PAGE 13)------ IN ADDITION, I HAVE ALSO-- POSTED TO THIS WEBSITE NUMEROUS------------------------- RESPONSES--------- FROM------------------------- DIFFERENT SETS OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWYERS--------- WHO ALSO------------------------ ARGUE------- AND-------------------------- CONTEST------- MY VIEWS REGARDING THE MEANING OF--------INCOME  AND WHETHER OR-- NOT THERE IS A LAW MAKING ANYONE  LIABLE  FOR INCOME TAXES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN ADDITION I HAVE ALSO POSTED------ THREE  REPORTS AND-- RECOMMENDATIONS  FROM U.S. MAGISTRATE JUDGE LAWRENCE R. LEAVITT WHO ALSO-- ARGUES THAT------ MY VIEWS ON THESE ISSUES ARE------------------------ DEAD WRONG-------.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THESE OFFICIAL, LEGAL VOICES ALL-- EXPLAINING   ON THIS WEBSITE - WHY MY VIEWS ON INCOME TAXES ARE--------------------------DEAD WRONG-------, HOW CAN ANYONE BE MISLED BY ME? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I URGE EVERYONE TO READ ALL OF THE PLEADINGS NOW POSTED TO-- THIS WEBSITE FILED BY U.S. ATTORNEYS AND THE COURT ALL CLAIMING THAT MY-- UNDERSTANDING OF OUR INCOME TAX LAWS IS------------------------ DEAD WRONG-------.-------- (MORE SUCH------ PLEADINGS AND DOCUMENTS------ WILL BE POSTED TO THIS WEB SITE AS-- THEY BECOME AVAILABLE)------ I, THEREFORE, URGE EVERYONE TO: (1) CHECK OUT THE-- INTERNAL REVENUE CODE ITSELF; (2) CONSULT WITH-YOUR LAWYER AND/OR ACCOUNTANT-- CONCERNING ANY AND ALL MATERIAL CONTAINED ON THIS WEBSITE AND ANYTHING I-- MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN AND SAID ABOUT INCOME TAXES; AND (3) ASK THE IRS ITSELF--, BEFORE YOU RELY ON ANYTHING I MIGHT HAVE SAID OR WRITTEN IN CONNECTION WITH-- INCOME TAXES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- REMEMBER, ALL FEDERAL JUDGES AND U.S. ATTORNEYS MAINTAIN THAT-- MUCH OF WHAT I SAY ABOUT INCOME TAXES IS------------------------ DEAD WRONG---------, AND IN MANY CASES, MIGHT EVEN CONSTITUTE TAX EVASION.------ I, OF COURSE, DO NOT-- AGREE WITH THAT, SINCE I WOULD NEVER ADVOCATE VIOLATIONS OF LAW   WHICH IS-- WHY I SELL THE LAW AND ITS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. HOWEVER, I MAY EVEN BE--  DELUSIONAL,------------------------  SO DON T TAKE MY WORD FOR ANYTHING---------, WITHOUT CHECKING OUT ALL OF THE UNDERLYING FACTS AND WHAT THE IRS, THE DOJ--, AND THE COURTS------ HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE MATTER.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ON PAGES 33   35 OF THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION YOU WILL FIND-- ALL THE THINGS I HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO DO BY THE COURT.------------ REMEMBER, I AM-- APPEALING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS INJUNCTION TO THE SUPREME COURT AND-- HOPEFULLY THAT COURT WILL ACCEPT CERTIORARI.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WOULD LIKE TO HELP ME MAKE THAT VOYAGE-- TO THE SUPREME COURT SO I CAN ATTEMPT TO SALVAGE THAT PORTION OF THE 1ST-- AMENDMENT THAT GUARANTEES  FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND OF THE PRESS--,  CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THAT VOYAGE------ WILL BE GRATEFULLY ACCEPTED-------------------------   SINCE IF I ALLOW THIS INJUNCTION TO STAND, THE----- 1ST-------- AMENDMENT IS EFFECTIVELY DEAD IN AMERICA.------- THE BRIEFS WE FILED ON THIS-- ISSUE WITH THE----- 9TH------ CIRCUIT APPEAL WILL SHORTLY BE POSTED TO THIS-- WEB SITE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ALSO JUDGE LLOYD D. GEORGE S PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ORDER--, WAS BASED ON A HEARING IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT DID----- NOT PUT ON ONE WITNESS-- THAT I COULD CROSS-EXAMINE.------ I, ON THE OTHER HAND, DEMANDED TO BE PUT UNDER-- OATH AND CHALLENGED THE GOVERNMENT TO CROSS-EXAMINE ME AND IDENTIFY ANY-- PASSAGE IN ANY OF MY BOOKS THAT ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO BREAK THE LAW.------ THEY-- REFUSED TO DO SO EVEN THOUGH I OFFERED TO (1) STOP SELLING ALL OF MY BOOKS;-- AND (2) NOT OPPOSE THEIR INJUNCTION IF THEY DID SO.------ YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE-- 2-  HOUR HEARING BY------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ CLICKING HERE----.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PRIMARY REASON T--------------------------------------------------------HE-- GOVERNMENT GAVE, FOR BANNING--- THE FEDERAL MAFIA---- WAS THAT IT CONTAINS-- INFORMATION ON HOW TO FILE A  ZERO  RETURN. THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED THAT MY--  ZERO  RETURN PROMOTED TAX EVASION AND WAS SOMEHOW TIED IN TO  COMMERCIAL-- SPEECH,  THEREFORE;--- THE FEDERAL MAFIA---- WAS NOT PROTECTED BY THE 1ST-- AMENDMENT.------ HOWEVER, I HAVE NOW POSTED THE  ZERO  RETURN I PERSONALLY FILED-- FOR THE YEAR 2003 ON THIS WEBSITE.------ THEREFORE, ANYONE CAN HAVE THE-- INFORMATION--- FREE OF CHARGE----. SO, WHERE IS THE  COMMERCIAL SPEECH ?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I HAVE-- ALSO POSTED TO THIS WEBSITE A WAGE STATEMENT THAT SHOWS HOW THE IRS-- (ACTUALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT) GOES ABOUT CONFISCATING 90% OF A PERSON S-- WAGES WITHOUT HEARINGS OR COURT ORDERS OF ANY KIND. IS THIS THE ACTION OF A--  GREAT NATION ?-------------------------------------------------- IF YOU'D LIKE TO HELP RID AMERICA OF THIS ECONOMICALLY DESTRUCTIVE AND----- ILLEGALLY ENFORCED  TAX,  HELP DISSEMINATE THESE PLEADINGS FAR AND WIDE.----- THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL OF ITS MINIONS OBVIOUSLY ARE TRYING TO CRUSH ME IN----- ORDER TO PREVENT ME FROM--- INFORMING AND EDUCATING---- THE AMERICAN PUBLIC----- CONCERNING HOW IT--- ILLEGALLY---- AND--- DESTRUCTIVELY---- COLLECTS INCOME TAXES   AND----- WHAT THE PUBLIC MIGHT DO TO PROTECT ITSELF.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BESIDES HAVING UNLIMITED----- MANPOWER TO COME AT ME, THE GOVERNMENT ALSO HAS A PRINTING PRESS WHICH----- ALLOWS IT TO (ILLEGALLY) PRINT AS MUCH FIAT CURRENCY AS IT NEEDS TO DO THE----- JOB. I, OF COURSE, HAVE NO SUCH PRINTING PRESS. ALL I HAVE TO FIGHT WITH IS----- TRUTH, AND WHATEVER ENERGY I CAN MUSTER AT AGE-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOWEVER, FIGHTING THE GOVERNMENT BOTH CIVILLY AND CRIMINALLY TAKES BOTH TIME----- AND MONEY. SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HELP ME FINANCIALLY FIGHT A GOVERNMENT----- WHOSE--- LAWLESS---- ENFORCEMENT OF THE INCOME TAX HAS LITERALLY--- BANKRUPTED THIS----- NATION----, AND CONVERTED IT INTO BEING THE WORLD S BIGGEST DEBTOR NATION, WHILE----- DESTROYING ITS RAILROADS, SHIPPING LINES, AND MOST OF ITS FACTORIES, YOU CAN----- MAIL CONTRIBUTIONS TO FREEDOM BOOKS, 444 EAST SAHARA, LAS VEGAS, NEVADA---------------------------------------------------------- OR BUY COPIES OF THE BOOKS AND RESEARCH FROM FREEDOM BOOKS----.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOWEVER, NOT ONLY HAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEEN--- ILLEGALLY---- COLLECTING----- INCOME TAXES, AS IS CLEARLY SHOWN IN THE DOCUMENTS NOW POSTED TO THIS WEB----- SITE, BUT IT HAS BEEN THE LAWLESS, IRRESPONSIBLE AND DESTRUCTIVE COLLECTION----- OF THIS TAX THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF PRACTICALLY----- AMERICA S ENTIRE INDUSTRIAL BASE AND OUR TOTAL DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN CAPITAL----- TO FUND FEDERAL DEFICITS. WHERE 50 YEARS AGO PRACTICALLY ALL THE PRODUCTS----- AMERICAN S USED AND WORE WERE MADE IN AMERICA, ALMOST NOTHING WE USE OR WARE----- IS MADE IN AMERICA TODAY.------ AND IT IS NOT CHEAP FOREIGN LABOR THAT HAS----- DRIVEN AMERICAN JOBS OVERSEAS, BUT THE GOVERNMENT S DESTRUCTIVE ECONOMIC AND----- FISCAL POLICIES (PUSHED BY BOTH DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS-----) THAT HAVE DONE IT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I SAW THIS HAPPENING 30 YEARS AGO, WHICH IS WHY I WROTE--- THE BIGGEST CON: HOW----- THE GOVERNMENT IS FLEECING YOU----. THE LAST TWO CHAPTERS OF THAT BOOK ARE----- ENTITLED,  THE DECLINE OF U.S. ECONOMIC POWER   HOW THE GOVERNMENT AND THE----- FEDERAL RESERVE ARRANGED IT  AND  THE SOLUTION TO AMERICA S ECONOMIC AND----- SOCIAL PROBLEMS.  A MORE SIMPLIFIED VERSION IS COVERED IN HOW AN ECONOMY----- GROWS AND WHY IT DOESN T, PUBLISHED IN---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF JOB LOSS IN AMERICA AND  OUTSOURCING  IS THE----- SAME TODAY AS IT WAS WHEN I FOCUSED ON THE PROBLEM SOME 30 YEARS AGO. ------------------------LOU----- DOBBS OF CNN------- HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR MONTHS. SO I-- SENT HIM AN E-MAIL ON THE SUBJECT, SINCE NONE OF HIS GUESTS APPEARED TO HAVE-- A CLUE AS TO WHY THIS IS HAPPENING AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO ABOUT IT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- READ MY ECONOMIC-- COMMENTARY TO LOU DOBBS----.----------- "WHEN WILL LOU DOBBS GET IT RIGHT?-----".------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHY NOT WRITE OR E-MAIL LOU DOBBS AND ASK HIM TO HAVE ME ON HIS SHOW, SINCE----- ITS ABOUT TIME THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEARD SOMEONE ON NETWORK TV WHO KNOWS----- SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM; WHY IT DEVELOPED, AND WHAT STEPS THE NATION----- MUST TAKE IF THE PROBLEM IS TO BE SOLVED, IF IT IS NOT ALREADY TOO LATE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASE MY BOOKS, RESEARCH AND OTHER INFORMATION NOW FOR THERE IS NO----- GUARANTEE THAT THE 9TH CIRCUIT WILL REVERSE ITS OPINION SUSTAINING THE FIRST----- AMENDMENT INJUNCTION. GET ALL OF THE TRUTH WHILE YOU STILL CAN.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WELCOME TO AMERIKA.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [1] FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, THE INCOME TAX STARTED IN 1943 WHEN THE----- GOVERNMENT INSTITUTED THE  WITHHOLDING TAX  AS A TEMPORARY, WARTIME MEASURE----- AND CALLED IT A  VICTORY TAX.  CONGRESSMEN WOULD HAVE RISKED BEING LYNCHED----- HAD THEY ATTEMPTED TO PASS A LAW, DURING PEACETIME THAT TOOK TAXES OUT OF----- THE PAYCHECKS OF WORKING AMERICANS. HOWEVER, WITH 10 MILLION AMERICANS UNDER----- ARMS AND NUMEROUS SERVICEMEN DYING EVERYDAY, HOW COULD THOSE ON THE HOME----- FRONT OBJECT TO A  VICTORY TAX ? IN THIS MANNER, CONGRESS WAS ABLE TO PASS A----- TAX THAT WAS--- UNCONSTITUTIONAL---- ON A VARIETY OF GROUNDS, (FOR ONE SUCH----- SURPRISING GROUND--- SEE THE FEDERAL MAFIA - PP----159-161), AND THE FEDERAL------GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ENCOURAGING AMERICANS------ TO SPEND-- (AND NOT SAVE), SINCE THIS IS HOW------ GOVERNMENT STATISTICIANS AND ECONOMISTS-- (IDIOTICALLY) MEASURE AMERICAN  PROSPERITY,  NOT BY HOW MUCH AMERICANS-- PRODUCE AND SAVE, BUT HOW MUCH AMERICANS------ SPEND AND CONSUME.------ HOWEVER, WHEN-- AMERICANS SPEND, PRACTICALLY ALL THE PRODUCTS THEY NOW BUY ARE MANUFACTURED-- IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.------ THEREFORE, AMERICAN CONSUMER SPENDING DOES NOT ENRICH-- AMERICANS, IT ENRICHES THOSE FOREIGN WORKERS WHO PRODUCE THE PRODUCTS THAT-- AMERICANS NOW BUY.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THEREFORE, WHEN-- OUR GOVERNMENT NEEDS MONEY TO FUND ITS DEFICITS, IT CAN T LOOK TO AMERICANS--, SINCE AMERICANS ARE HARD AT WORK  SPENDING  NOT- SAVING.  THEREFORE,-OUR-- GOVERNMENT NOW HAS TO RELY ON FOREIGNERS TO FUND ITS DEFICITS.------------ SO, WHERE-- ONCE AMERICAN FACTORIES PRODUCED THE CONSUMER GOODS THAT GAVE AMERICA THE-- WORLD S HIGHEST STANDARD OF-LIVING, AND WHERE ITS ECONOMY------ GENERATED THE-- SAVINGS NEEDED TO FINANCE FEDERAL DEFICITS--TODAY THE AMERICAN ECONOMY-- PRODUCES NEITHER.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AMERICA, THANKS TO-- FEDERAL PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE:  THE NEW DEAL,   THE FAIR DEAL,   THE-- GREAT SOCIETY,  THE NEW FRONTIER,  AND THE  WELFARE STATE,  (ALL VARIATIONS-- OF SOCIALISM) HAVE RESULTED IN AMERICA NOW BECOMING------ TOTALLY DEPENDANT--------- ON: (1) THE CONSUMER GOODS PRODUCED BY FOREIGNERS (AND THEIR-- WILLINGNESS TO SHIP THEM TO US ON CREDIT), AND (2) THE WILLINGNESS OF-- FOREIGNERS TO LEND US THEIR MONEY, SO OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN PAY ITS-- BILLS.------ WHAT------ HAPPENS TO THE AMERICAN STANDARD OF LIVING (TO SAY NOTHING OF-- AMERICA S ABILITY TO WAGE WAR) WHEN FOREIGN NATIONS NO LONGER WANT TO DO-- EITHER?------ SO, AMERICA S ONCE GREAT, ECONOMY, WHICH TOOK PAST GENERATIONS OF-- PRODUCTIVE AMERICANS APPROXIMATELY 300 YEARS TO BUILD (UNDER A FREE-- ENTERPRISE SYSTEM WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS HERE),------ WASHINGTON D.C.-- POLITICIANS------ MANAGED TO DESTROY IN APPROXIMATELY 5--YEARS OF MEDDLING.-------- TRAGICALLY,------ THE DAY MUST INEVITABLY ARRIVE WHEN SOMEBODY WILL WRITE A BOOK --ENTITLED,  THE RISE AND FALL OF AMERICA.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
