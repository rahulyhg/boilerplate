---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TEXT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE JOURNAL OF THE AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATION OF WRITING PROGRAMS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LETTERS TO THE EDITOR-------------------------  THE APRIL 2002 ISSUE OF TEXT CARRIED AN ARTICLE BY-------------------------------- KEVIN--------- BROPHY---- ON THE PROSE POEM. THIS ARTICLE ATTRACTED SEVERAL RESPONSES.--------- TOM SHAPCOTT'S AND MOYA COSTELLO'S ARE PRINTED BELOW.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FROM TOM SHAPCOTT---------------------------------------------- DEAR TESS AND NIGEL----THANKS FOR THE NEW ISSUE OF TEXT. I WAS INTERESTED TO READ BILL MANHIRE'S----------PIECE AND AGREED WITH MUCH IT SAID-AND ESPECIALLY THE CONCEPT OF OPENING--------- STUDENTS TO THE CONCEPT OF REACHING INTO THE DARK. THIS TIES IN WITH THE--------- ARTICLE ON THE PROSE POEM BY KEVIN BROPHY AND I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A--------- 'RESPONSE' TO KEVIN'S PIECE.----------------------- THE PROSE POEM IN AUSTRALIA - AND ELSEWHERE------------------------ IN HIS ARTICLE---- THE PROSE POEM: A SHORT HISTORY, A BRIEF REFLECTION----------- AND A DOSE OF THE REAL THING----- KEVIN BROPHY GIVES A QUICK READING----------- OF THE HISTORY OF THIS GENRE, BEGINNING IN FRANCE WITH BAUDELAIRE AND----------- FINDING, IT WOULD SEEM, SOME SORT OF FRINGE HABITATION IN AMERICA. BROPHY----------- THEN GOES ON TO RELATE DIFFICULTIES HE HAS HAD IN PERSUADING HIS STUDENTS----------- TO ATTEMPT THE FORRN.------------- I BELIEVE HIS 'DIFFICULTIES' POSSIBLY RELATE TO TWO THINGS. FIRSTLY-----------FROM HIS ARTICLE HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE TAKEN ACCOUNT OF ANY AUSTRALIAN----------ATTEMPTS TO DEVELOP THE FORM, AND SECONDLY, THE SENSE OF RESISTANCE HE----------NOTES MIGHT BE ALIGNED WITH ATTEMPTS TO PERSUADE STUDENTS TO WRITE POETRY--------- AT ALL.--------------- THIS LATTER STATEMENT OF MINE IS, PERHAPS, OVERSTRESSING THE POINT-----------, BUT I THINK MANY TEACHES OF CREATIVE WRITING HAVE FOUND A CERTAIN RESISTANCE----------- AMONG STUDENTS TO ATTEMPT POETRY OUTSIDE THE OLD 'MAINSTREAM' FORMAL----------- STRUCTURES. THIS, IN MY EXPERIENCE, RELATES BACK TO THE GENERAL AUSTRALIAN----------- RESISTANCE TO ANY FORMS OF MODERNISM IN THE 20TH CENTURY AND A-SUSPICION----------- OF EXPERIMENTATION AS-A SELF CONSCIOUS LITERARY DEVICE.--------------- AT THE BASIC LEVEL, NEW STUDENTS OFTEN HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN EVEN----------- WRITING ABOUT THEIR LOCAL ENVIRONMENT. SOMETHING FAR OFF, FANTASTIC----------- (OR FANTASY-FUL) OR GLAMOROUS IS OFTEN THE INSTINCTIVE CHOICE. HOW MANY----------- FUTURISTIC OR GOTHIC OR NEANDERTHAL EPICS HAVE WE SEEN-FROM BEGINNERS?----------- TO HARNESS WRITERS DOWN TO NAMING SPECIFIC STREETS OR SUBURBS IS AN----------- EARLY BUT MAJOR TASK. TO MAKE THE LEAP BEYOND HABITATION AND SPECIFIC----------- PERCEPTION INTO THE SUBJECTIVE DISLOCATIONS AND LEAPS OF ASSOCIATION----------- IMPLICIT IN THE PROSE POEM IS A LEAP INDEED.------------- PERHAPS IF WE HAD AN ANTHOLOGY OF THE PROSE POEM IN AUSTRALIA THE TASK--------- OS TEACHERS MIGHT BE CONSIDERABLY LIGHTENED. AND SOME VERY EXCITING POSSIBILITIES--------- OPENED UP.--------------- IN 1982 WHEN I WAS WRITER-IN-RESIDENCE AT DEAKIN UNIVERSITY IN GEELONG----------- THEIR MAGAZINE---- MATTOID----- PUBLISHED AN INTERVIEW WITH ME ON THE----------- PROSE POEM. THIS WAS REPRINTED IN 1990 IN MY COLLECTION OF ESSAYS,---- BITING----------- THE BULLET----- (SIMON---- & SCHUSTER) AND IN THAT I GAVE NOT ONLY A----------- RUN-DOWN ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORM--FROM 19TH CENTURY FRANCE TO----------- MODERN ENGLISH EXPLORATIONS OF THE GENRE, MOST NOTABLY IN THE U.S. (AND----------- LEANING ON LATIN AMERICAN EXEMPLARS, WHICH IN-THE 1960S BECAME SUDDENLY----------- AVAILABLE IN TRANSLATION IN THE STATES). KEVIN BROPHY DOES-NOT MENTION----------- THE GREAT RISE OF PROSE POEMS IN THE LATIN AMERICA, NOR EUROPE, BUT----------- THESE WERE PERTINENT PHASES. WHEN MARK STRAND AND CHARLES SIMIC PUBLISHED--------------- ANOTHER REPUBLIC----- IN 1976 (ECCO NY) THEY MADE A MAJOR STEP IN----------- INTRODUCING 17 CONTEMPORARY POETS IN ENGLISH TRANSLATION. OF THESE-----------, NO LESS THAN SEVEN WERE REPRESENTED-WITH PROSE POEMS, SEVERAL OF THEM----------- ENTIRELY IN THIS FORM: FRANCIS PONGE, HENRI MICHAUX, ZBIGNIEW HERBERT-----------, JULIO CORTAZAR, OCTAVIO PAZ, MIROSLAV HOLUB AND ITALO CALVINO. MOST----------- OF THESE NAMES ARE NOW WELL KNOW, EVEN IN AUSTRALIA.------------- MY INTERVIEW ARTICLE EXPLORED SOME OF THE REASONS THESE TOOK HOLD IN--------- THE CREATIVE MINDS OF AN IMPORTANT SEGMENT OF AMERICAN POETS. WHAT I DID--------- NOT MENTION WAS THAT AMERICAN POETRY AT THAT STAGE HAD ALREADY MASSIVELY--------- BROKEN WITH OLD FORMAL TRADITIONS, AND 'FIELD POETRY' OFFERED AN EVEN--------- GREATER SENSE OF FLEXIBILITY AND LAYOUT EXPERIMENT THAN THE PROSE POEM.--------- NEVERTHELESS, IT CAN BE SAID THE PROSE POEM DID ESTABLISH ITS PLACE AND--------- THERE ARE MANY MORE COLLECTIONS OF GREAT INTEREST PUBLISHED THAN IS HINTED--------- AT IN KEVIN BROPHY'S (ADMITTEDLY CONCISE) ARTICLE.--------------- THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORM IN AUSTRALIA WAS OUTLINED IN MY PIECE-----------, AND IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO RE-PRINT IT AT THE END OF THIS SMALL RESPONSE.----------- I HAD BEEN INTERESTED - AND STILL AM - IN THE CONCEPT OF AN ANTHOLOGY----------- OF PROSE POEMS FROM AUSTRALIA, THOUGH TO DATE I HAVE NOT MANAGED TO----------- INTEREST A PUBLISHER. PERHAPS IT IS NOW TIME.---------------- WHEN I EDITED THE UQP VERSE ANTHOLOGY---- THE-MOMENT MADE MARVELLOUS---------------- IN 1998 I INCLUDED PROSE POEMS BY PAMELA BROWN, JOANNE BUMS, GARY CATALANO------------AND JUDITH RODRIGUEZ--HER---- BORGES AT----- 73 ALSO INVOKES ONE OF THE----------- MOST-INFLUENTIAL OF THE INFLUENTIAL LATIN AMERICAN EXPERIMENTERS IN----------- THE FORM, SEEN AT ITS MOST EXPANSIVE AND FLEXIBLE).--------------- CERTAINLY AS A TECHNIQUE, THE PROSE POEM CONTINUES TO ATTRACT AUSTRALIAN----------- POETS AND THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF BOOK-LENGTH COLLECTIONS----------- THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED HERE. I COULD LIST, FOR INSTANCE, ANDREW TAYLOR'S--------------- PARABOLAS----- (WHICH AS I MENTIONED IN MY MATTOID INTERVIEW WAS----------- THE FIRST BOOK OF PROSE POEMS TO BE PUBLISHED IN THIS COUNTRY), TWO----------- BOOKS BY BRUCE BEAVER (----HEADLANDS----- UQP 1986 AND---- AS IT WAS---------------- UQP 1979), TWO BY MYSELF (----TURNING FULL CIRCLE----- NEW POETRY----------- 1979 AND---- STUMP AND GRAPE AND BOPPLE-NUT BULLION----- 1982), SEVERAL STUNNING----------- BOOKS BY GARY CATALANO (INCLUDING---- FRESH LINEN-----, UQP 1988), ANIA----------- WALWICZ, LAURIE DUGGAN (INCLUDING THE AWARD-WINNING---- THE ASH RANGE----------------, PICADOR 1987), RODNEY HALL'S---- THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WORLD----- (UQP----------- 1981), ALL OF PHILIP HAMMIELL'S BOOKS FROM 1976 TO 1994, RUDI KRAUSMANN'S--------------- FROM ANOTHER SHORE----- (WILD---- & WOOLLEY 1975), GERARD LEE'S--------------- MANUAL FOR A GARDEN MECHANIC----- (1976), ALISON CROGGON'S---- NEVIGATO---------------- (BLACK PEPPER 1996), AND BOOKS BY PAMELA BROWN, JOANNE BUMS AND ANNA----------- COUANI. AND THAT IS ONLY SKIMMING THE SURFACE.--------------- IN ADDITION, MANY AUSTRALIAN POETS HAVE PUBLISHED OCCASIONAL PROSE----------- POEMS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THEIR GENERAL COLLECTIONS: CHRIS WALLACE-CRABBE-----------, DAVID MALOUF AND KEVIN HART, ON TO M.T.C.CRONIN, LUKE DAVIES, JOHN SCOTT-----------, JOHN KINSELLA AND MICHAEL SARABIN, AGAIN TO NAME ONLY A FEW.--------------- WHAT THESE LISTS DO SUGGEST IS THAT AS A DISTINCT GENRE, THE PROSE----------- POEM IN AUSTRALIA IS ALIVE AND WELL. PROBABLY IN BETTER HEALTH THAN----------- THE SESTINA, THE SONNET OR THE HAIKU.------------- THE ADVANTAGE OF AN ANTHOLOGY, NOW, WOULD BE TO SUGGEST TO TEACHERS OF--------- CREATIVE WRITING IN AUSTRALIA SOMETHING OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEVELOPMENT--------- OF THE FORM. AND IT HAS TAKEN, I THINK, SPECIFICALLY AUSTRALIAN RESONANCES.--------- IF IT COULD BE SAID TO REMAIN ESSENTIALLY LYRICAL IN ITS PREOCCUPATION--------- WITH LANGUAGE (AND EVEN CADENCE), IT IS MORE GENTLY SATIRICAL AND SOMETIMES--------- EVEN RUEFUL THAN ITS AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS. IT HAS LESS ANGER, MORE STOICISM.--------- LESS EXTRAVAGANCE, MORE ESSENTIAL CAUTION. WE ARE, LET US REMEMBER, A--------- SUPREMELY CAUTIOUS PEOPLE. THE TAMPA AFFAIR HAS, MOST RECENTLY, ALL TOO--------- CLEARLY ILLUSTRATED THAT.--------------- BUT THE AUSTRALIAN EVOLUTION OF THE PROSE-POEM IS NO MERELY PALLID----------- THING, A SORT OF PALE REFLECTION OF THE WAN ENGLISH VERSIONS (AND, AS----------- WITH RECENT ENGLISH ART WORKS WHICH SET OUT TO SHOCK, THE ENGLISH PROSE----------- POEM HAS A TERRIBLE POSING SAFETY-PIN-IN-THE-NOSTRIL AND STUD-IN-THE-PENIS----------- DETERMINATION THAT MERELY CHAFES). IT ALSO HAS SOMETHING OF THE AUSTRALIAN----------- LACONIC WIT AND DEFIANCE, AND IT CAN GET UNDER THE SKIN OF THE MORE----------- CONVENTIONAL VERSE STRUCTURES, WHICH BEAR THE GHOSTLY TRAIN OF THE MEASURED----------- CADENCE STILL. AS KEVIN BROPHY SAYS, THE PROSE POEM IS SUBVERSIVE. THAT----------- IS SOMETHING AUSTRALIANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD AT, EVEN IF THEY ARE----------- OUTWARDLY CAUTIOUS AND CONFORMIST. IF YOUNG READERS COULD SEE SOMETHING----------- OF THE RANGE AND SCOPE THAT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE LAST GENERATION OF----------- OUR POETS, THEY MIGHT BE MORE ABLE TO-SEE FOR THEMSELVES HOW AND WHERE----------- THE ADVENTURE MIGHT TAKE THEM.---------------------------------- THE 1982 INTERVIEW WITH MATTOID: ON PROSE POETRY------------- MATTOID:---- COULD WE START, TOM, BY DISCUSSING THE GENRE OF THE PROSE------------- POEM? THERE SEEMS PERHAPS A-CONTRADICTION OF TERMS HERE. POETRY AND------------- PROSE ARE SEPARATE MATTERS, HOW CAN-YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER AND EXPECT------------- THEM TO BE A 'REAL' FORM? WHAT DO YOU THINK A PROSE POEM CAN DO THAT------------- EITHER A POEM OR PROSE CAN'T DO?---------------------- TOM SHAPCOTT: YOUR STATEMENT THAT IT SEEMS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS------------- IS THE POINT AT WHICH THE PROSE POEM BEGAN. MOST TRUE PROSE POEMS------------- OPERATE FROM A SENSE OF CONTRADICTION OR I'D PREFER TO SAY THE TENSION------------- BETWEEN CERTAIN SORTS OF CLAIMS BEING MADE UPON LANGUAGE. THE BASIC------------- CLAIMS ARE THE DEMANDS OF AN INNATE LYRICISM AND THE DEMANDS OF PROSE------------- REALISM. I THINK THE GENRE AS IT HAS EVOLVED IN THE LAST-----OR------------- 130 YEARS OR SO HAS TRIED TO MAKE USE OF THE INTRINSICALLY DRAMATIC CONFLICT------------- INVOLVED. TO PLACE IT IN ITS HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: THE FIRST SUSTAINED------------- ATTEMPTS WERE BY CHARLES BAUDELAIRE - WORKS WRITTEN AS A RESULT OF------------- HEIGHTENED STATES THROUGH DRUG-TAKING. IT WAS THE URGENCY OF GETTING------------- SOMETHING DOWN, I'M SURE, THAT MADE HIM-WRITE THESE AS PROSE. HE WAS------------- A SUPERB CRAFTSMAN, AND HE DISCOVERED THAT SOMETHING CAME THROUGH------------- WHICH WAS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED HAD HE ATTEMPTED------------- IT IN A STANZAIC FORM. THERE ARE PRECURSORS TO THAT SORT OF DISCOVERY:------------- IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WALT WHITMAN USED A NON-STANZAIC LOPING STRUCTURE------------- AT A TIME WHEN IT WAS A REAL INNOVATION; THIS WAS BASED ON THE DYNAMICS------------- OF THE HEBRAIC PSALMS, WHICH INVOLVE A COUNTERBALANCE IN EACH SENTENCE.------------- BUT BAUDELAIRE'S PROSE POEMS OPENED UP FURTHER WAYS - THEY WERE CELEBRATORY,--------------IN OTHER WORDS, LYRICAL, BUT THEY USED THE LANGUAGE OF ORDINARY CONVERSATIONAL------------- DISCOURSE. AND IT WAS THROUGH THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THESE TWO FORCES------------- THAT SOMETHING INHERENTLY DIFFERENT CAME OUT. THE FRENCH TRADITION------------- EVER SINCE HAS EXPLORED THIS. IN ENGLISH, SUCH EXPERIMENTATION WAS------------- MUCH SLOWER. ELIOT'S EARLY ATTEMPTS WERE QUASI-TRANSLATIONS OF THE------------- FRENCH, AND HE LATER ABANDONED THE FORM. THEN, IN THE 1920S AND 1930S-------------, OTHER (MAINLY AMERICAN) WRITERS MADE SPORADIC EXPERIMENTS...------------------ M:---- YOUR SUMMARY OF THE PROSE POEM'S ORIGINS AND RELATIONSHIPS RAISES------------- SEVERAL INTERESTING POINTS ABOUT THE FORM. JUST BEFORE WE PURSUE THOSE-------------, THOUGH, COULD YOU BRING YOUR SURVEY UP TO DATE?----------------------- TS: AMERICAN, ENGLISH, EVEN AUSTRALIAN POETS HAD DONE THE ODD LITTLE------------- EXERCISE. FROM THE 1920S ONWARD. BUT THE FORM IN ENGLISH CAME TO A------------- NEW STAGE OF RICHNESS FROM THE LATE 1950S WHEN AMERICAN POETS STARTED------------- USING THE PROSE POEM IN A SERIOUS AND SUSTAINED WAY. THIS WAS THROUGH------------- THEIR POSTWAR INTEREST IN EUROPEAN AND ESPECIALLY SPANISH-LANGUAGE------------- POETRY AND TRANSLATIONS. THE SPANISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES HAD, AS IT------------- WERE, SPONTANEOUSLY FALLEN FOR THE COMBINATION OF VIGOUR AND VIOLENCE------------- IMPLICIT IN THE STRUCTURE. IN AUSTRALIA, CHRIS WALLACE-CRABBE WAS------------- THE FIRST POET TO TACKLE IT SERIOUSLY AS A FORM. HE WAS INFLUENCED-------------, THOUGH, BY THE FRENCH PROSE POEM, WHICH HAD BECOME A MUCH MORE ELEGANT------------- AND ALMOST 'COURTLY' STUDY IN LAYERS OF IRONY. THROUGH THE LAST DECADE------------- THE AMERICANS HAVE WIDELY EXPLORED THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE CLASH------------- BETWEEN THE EXTROVERT DYNAMISM AND GREED AND INTROVERTED IDEALISM------------- AND DESPAIR, AND THE PROSE POEM ALLOWED THEM TO HIT THE RAW NERVE------------- OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS - WHAM - IN A WAY THAT HAD ONLY BEEN TENTATIVE------------- BEFORE - SAY, IN THE WORK OF E E CUMMINGS...------------------ M:---- TO PURSUE THAT QUESTION OF FORM AND EXPECTATIONS: IF THE LINE-BREAKS------------- IN A POEM SUGGEST HOW WE SHOULD READ IT, WHAT MEANS DOES THE PROSE------------- POEM HAVE OF DIRECTING THE EXPECTATIONS WE BRING TO IT?----------------------- TS: VERY OFTEN THE 'POETIC' PART OF THE PROSE POEM IS EXPRESSED THROUGH------------- AN APPEAL TO ILLOGIC: TO STATES OF RECEPTIVITY WHICH DENY WHAT WE------------- HAVE COME TO EXPECT PROSE TO OFFER - THAT IS, RATIONAL DISCOURSE-------------, DESCRIPTIVE CLARITY, EVEN RHETORIC IN ITS CONVENTIONAL SENSE OF PERSUASION-------------, OF USING LANGUAGE TO SET CERTAIN COGS IN MOTION. THE PROSE POEM CREATES------------- ITS LYRICAL FRISSON BY POINTING THE READER'S ANTICIPATORY GLANDS IN------------- THAT DIRECTION- AND THEN SOMEHOW WORKING A CHANGE ... ALSO, THE PROSE------------- POEM SEEMS VERY MUCH A PRESENT-TENSE FORM. IT OPERATES ON A SENSE------------- OF IMMEDIACY: I AM DOING THIS, THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME. AND THAT'S------------- IMMEDIATELY CONDUCIVE TO A DREAM STATE, BECAUSE A DREAM HAS EXACTLY------------- THAT THINGS-ARE-HAPPENING-TO-ME-NOW FEELING. WHAT'S IMPLICIT IS THAT------------- I AM A PASSIVE RECEIVER OF CERTAIN THINGS. THINGS FLOW AROUND THE------------------ "I-----". THIS HAS BECOME CHARACTERISTIC OF A LOT OF PROSE POETRY:------------- AN OBSERVER IS OPERATED ON BY ALL SORTS OF THINGS, SOME MAGICAL, SOME------------- ABSOLUTELY MUNDANE. OFTEN THE JUXTAPOSITION BECOMES THE ACTIVE FORCE------------- - 'I AM SITTING IN A CAR THERE IS A BLUE PRAM BEING WHEELED PAST BY------------- A LADY WEARING A PINK FLORAL EIDERDOWN...' THE NAMING QUALITY BECOMES------------- IMPORTANT.----------------- M:---- SO ALTHOUGH SOME OF YOUR PROSE POEMS SUGGEST A NARRATIVE, THAT'S------------- NOT THE IMPORTANT THING?----------------------- TS: NO. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER INTERESTING QUALITY OF THE PROSE POEM------------- APART FROM THAT SURREAL EXPERIENCE PRESENTED WITH THE OPENNESS OF------------- A PASSIVE DREAM STATE. THIS IS THE IMPLICITLY DRAMATIC CONTEXT OF------------- A YOU-AND-ME. THE POEM BECOMES A DIALOGUE BETWEEN WRITER AND READER.------------- MANY OF THE MORE BIZARRE ELEMENTS OF A LOT OF PROSE POEMS ATTEMPT------------- TO PROVOKE THE READER INTO PARTICIPATING IN WHAT THE WORK OFFERS.------------- SOMETIMES SHOCK TACTICS ARE USED. SOMETIMES COERCIVE TACTICS.------------------ M:---- I'VE NOTICED THAT IN SOME OF YOUR PROSE POEMS THERE'S ALSO A DIALOGUE------------- WITHIN YOURSELF, OR THERE'S AN IMPLIED INTERLOCUTOR, AND PERHAPS VERY------------- OCCASIONALLY A DRAMATIC IMPERSONATION.------------------- TS: YES, THOUGH THAT'S LESS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FORM THAN THE USE OF--------- SURREALISM. THIS IS A WAY IN WHICH SURREALISM HAS BECOME LEGITIMATE, OPENING--------- UP POSSIBILITIES THAT SEEM NOT JUST JEJUNE.------------------ M:---- ARE THERE OTHER WAYS, THEN, IN WHICH VOICES, OR POINTS OF VIEW-------------, ARE IMPORTANT IN THE PROSE POEM?----------------------- TS: I SUGGEST THAT THE BEST PROSE POEMS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY------------- HAVE ALL TENDED TO BE GROUPS OF POEMS WHICH BUILD UP INTO SEQUENCES.------------- OCTAVIA PAZ, IN HIS BOOK-LENGTH---- EAGLE OF SUN----- (THE FIRST MAJOR------------- LATIN-AMERICAN ESSAY IN THE FORM, BY THE WAY), USES THE----- "I------------------" AS AN ORDINARY PERSON FULL OF PRACTICALITIES, INVOLVED WITH ORDINARY------------- FUNCTIONS, WHO IS ALSO EXPLORING WHAT IT IS TO BE A MEXICAN, AND AS------------- WELL HAVING A VISION OF THE OLD AZTEC GODS IN THE PRESENT-DAY WORLD.------------- ALL THESE THINGS COHERE BECAUSE OF THE SURREALISM AND TYPICAL SPANISH------------- VIOLENCE OF THE JUXTAPOSITIONS, THE BALANCE BETWEEN FLAT PROSE AND------------- HIGHLY FLORID COLOURATION. IT ONLY WORKS AS A SEQUENCE: EACH SMALL------------- PIECE BUILDS UPON THE NEXT AND UPON THE NEXT, LIKE INFINITE VARIATION.----------------------------- M:---- SO YOU GET BOTH THE ADVANTAGE OF LYRICISM, WHICH YOU MENTIONED------------- EARLIER, AND THE MORE EXTENDED SCOPE OF PROSE?----------------------- TS: THIS IS WHERE THE PROSE POEM CAN DEVELOP AS A MAJOR FORM. IT'S------------- A WAY OF CREATING A LYRICAL EPIC, IF YOU LIKE, WITHOUT A NARRATIVE------------- BUT WITH AN IMPLIED DRAMATIC CONTEXT, SO THAT ALL THOSE THINGS WE'VE------------- BEEN TALKING ABOUT, TENSIONS WITHIN EVEN THE ESSENCE OF THE WORD-------------, THE WORDS AS THEY CLING TOGETHER IN A SENTENCE, ARE EXPANDED AND BUILT------------- UPON IN THIS LARGER ACCRETION. THE MOST EXCITING AND SUCCESSFUL PROSE------------- POEMS OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAVE TAKEN THIS FORM - SUCH AS ITALO------------- CALVINO'S---- INVISIBLE CITIES-----, ROBERT BLY HAS ALSO DONE THREE------------- OR FOUR BOOKS OF PROSE POEMS; THEY'RE SMALL SEQUENCES BECAUSE BLY------------- IS ALWAYS A MINIATURIST, BUT ALL EXPLORE THAT CAPACITY FOR GROWTH------------- THROUGH ACCRETION. IN AUSTRALIA, ANDREW TAYLOR'S---- PARABOLAS----- WAS------------- A PIVOTAL WORK, THE FIRST BOOK-LENGTH COLLECTION OF PROSE POEMS HERE.------------- TO MENTION JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER AUSTRALIAN WRITERS: ANNA COUANI------------- ATTEMPTS A FORM CLOSER TO THE NON-NARRATIVE SHORT-STORY BUT WITH ALL------------- THE LYRICISM OF AN ETERNALLY DISPLACED PRESENT-TENSE I MENTIONED BEFORE.------------- ROBERT KENNY IN---- ETCETERA----- TRIES TO RECREATE AND EXPLORE HIS------------- CHILDHOOD IN THE EARLY 1950S: HE USES SHORT PROSE FORMS THAT LIST------------- JUST A FEW NON-ESSENTIAL ITEMS SUDDENLY ISOLATED TO GIVE THAT STRANGE------------- INTENSITY LIKE AN UNEXPECTED PHOTOGRAPH OF A FAMILIAR SCENE. THE BOOK------------- ITSELF MIGHT NOT 'LIVE' MORE THAN A FEW YEARS, BUT ITS IMPORTANCE------------- IS GREATER THAN CAN BE OBJECTIVELY MEASURED: IT'S ALREADY GIVEN RISE------------- TO OTHER COLLECTIONS OF A SIMILAR SORT ?? BY LAURIE DUGGAN AND DENIS------------- GALLAGHER, FOR INSTANCE.------------------ M:---- AMONG THE TITLES YOU MENTION----- PARABOLAS---- AND YOUR OWN------------------ TURNING FULL CIRCLE---- BOTH USE THE IMAGE OF THE CURVE, OF THE------------- MOMENTUM THAT COMES BACK TO ITSELF. PRESUMABLY RECURRENCE IS IMPORTANT------------- IN THOSE SEQUENCES OF PROSE POEMS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?----------------------- TS: YES, THAT HITS VERY MUCH TO THE CENTRE. FINDING WHAT'S WITHIN------------- THE CIRCLE. THE GREATEST OF ALL FRENCH PROSE POETS MUST BE FRANCIS------------- PONGE AND HIS---- SOAP----- IS A GREAT CIRCULAR PATTERN OF FINDING AND------------- REFINDING...I HADN'T PREVIOUSLY TRACED THAT AS AN OVERRIDING FORMAL------------- FOCUS, THOUGH I'D BEEN INTRIGUED BY THE CAPACITY OF THE PROSE POEM------------- TO WORK THROUGH EXTENDED GROUPINGS - AND CERTAINLY THE 'RONDO' OR------------- 'VARIATION' MUSICAL FORMS HAD SEEMED SOMEHOW PARALLEL.------------------ M:---- YET IN YOUR OWN----- TURNING FULL CIRCLE---- YOU DO USE THE IMAGE------------- OF MUSIC FROM TIME TO TIME SO YOU HAVE THAT SENSE OF DEVELOPMENT OF------------- MOTIF, ITS RECURRENCE AND VARIATION.----------------------- TS: IN MY COLLECTION THERE WERE CERTAIN RECURRING MOTIFS AND A SELF-CONSCIOUS------------- PREOCCUPATION WITH 'TURNING FULL CIRCLE', OF ENDING UP WHERE YOU STARTED------------- - BUT YOU NEVER COME BACK TO WHERE YOU STARTED WITH EXACTLY THE SAME------------- PERSPECTIVE.------------------ M:---- YES, THERE'S NO SENSE OF ANY CONTRIVED CONNECTIONS AND YET THEY------------- OBVIOUSLY DO RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER.----------------------- TS: ONE HAS PREOCCUPATIONS IN ANY TIME OF ONE'S LIFE. BUT OTHERS------------- WHICH ARE MUCH MORE BASIC COME THROUGH. FOR THE VERY LAST GROUP I------------- LOOKED BACK - AND THEN I TRIED TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS, PARTLY BECAUSE------------- I FELT I'D BEEN FOLLOWING A CERTAIN THREAD, SEEING WHERE IT LED, AND------------- SUDDENLY I THOUGHT: NO, THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TOO------------- IN THIS FORM. THAT WAS WHERE I INTRODUCED THE SHORT-LOIN CHOPS - TO------------- CREATE A COMPRESSED SHORT-STORY RESONANCE. I USED A THIRD PERSON THERE------------- AS A CONTRAST. THE TEMPTATION WAS TO BUST THE FORM OPEN, TRY SOMETHING------------- WIDER...------------------------------------------------- READING THAT INTERVIEW AGAIN, THESE DECADES LATER, I AM OF COURSE STRUCK----------- WITH THE EXTENDED BOOK-LENGTH PROSE POEM SEQUENCE THAT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED----------- IN AUSTRALIA IN MORE RECENT YEARS. CERTAINLY LAURIE DUGGAN'S---- THE----------- ASH RANGE----- STANDS OUT, BUT ALSO JOHN TRANTER'S RECENT---- DIFFERENT----------- HANDS----- (FOLIO/FREMANTLE ARTS CENTRE PRESS 1998), WHICH CALLS ITSELF----------- 'SEVEN STORIES', COMES MORE TRULY INTO THE GENRE OF PROSE POEM (AND-----------, FOR THAT MATTER, SOME OF DAVID BROOKS' STORIES SIMILARLY LEAN IN THAT----------- DIRECTION RATHER THAN AS STRAIGHTFORWARD 'PROSE'). I MYSELF HAVE ALWAYS----------- CONSIDERED MY NOVEL---- WHITE STAG OF EXILE----- MORE TRULY A PROSE POEM.----------- THE THING IS, I MUST MAINTAIN, WE NOW HAVE AN ACHIEVED BODY OF WORK----------- IN THIS FORM. WE SHOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT IT. KNOWING IT MORE CLOSELY-----------, WE CAN TEACH IT MORE ABLY. THAT IS MY BELIEF.---------------- TOM SHAPCOTT------------ PROFESSOR OF CREATIVE WRITING, UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FROM MOYA COSTELLO------------------------------------------------ TO THE EDITORS,------------ RE KEVIN BROPHY'S PAPER 'THE PROSE POEM: A SHORT HISTORY, A BRIEF REFLECTION----------- AND A DOSE OF THE REAL THING' IN THE APRIL 2002 EDITION OF TEXT: HTTP://WWW.GU.EDU.AU/SCHOOL/ART/TEXT/APRIL--------------------------------02/BROPHY.HTM---------------, I QUOTE FROM THE PAPER:--------------------------------------- WHILE THE SUBVERSIVE FRENCH POETIC FORM OF VERS LIBRE WAS TAKEN UP------------- BY ENGLISH WRITERS IN THE MODERNIST ERA TO THE POINT WHERE FREE VERSE------------- NOW DOMINATES POETRY WRITTEN IN ENGLISH,-------- THERE HAS BEEN NO COMPARABLE------------- INTEREST IN THE PROSE POEM AMONG ENGLISH-SPEAKING WRITERS.--------- [MY------------- EMPHASIS-------------------------------------] FOR THE SOUNDINGS '97 POETRY CONFERENCE IN ADELAIDE, I DELIVERED A----------- PAPER ON THE PROSE POEM (UNPUBLISHED, THOUGH SIMILAR COMMENTS IN IT----------- APPEAR IN MY ARTICLES 'THE FETISHIZED FRAGMENT'?

IT'S----------- A QUOTE FROM JOANNE BURNS' MANIFESTO IN THAT NOW CLASSIC TEXT---- POETRY----------- AND GENDER FROM BROOKS AND WALKER----- (UQP 1989). BURNS TALKS OF HERSELF----------- AS 'A HYBRID, PROSE POETIE SORT OF POET'. IN THE SAME BOOK PAMELA BROWN----------- SAYS OF HER PROSE PIECES THAT THEY ARE 'SNAPSHOTS OF CONDITIONS. INCIDENTS----------- OF EMOTION. EPISODES FROM A LONG RUNNING SERIAL. CHRONICLES OF A TRANSITION----------- WHICH IS NEVER COMPLETED'.--------------- THE BEST EXEMPLARY PRACTITIONERS OF THE PROSE POEM TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE----------- AT ANY TIME ARE AMONG CONTEMPORARY AUSTRALIAN WOMEN WRITERS (OFTEN CATEGORISED----------- AS FEMINIST/EXPERIMENTAL), INCLUDING BURNS AND BROWN. ANNA COUANI AND----------- SUSAN HAMPTON ARE TWO MORE.---------------- BROPHY COMMENTS IN HIS PAPER:---------------------------------------- ONE CONSEQUENCE OF THE RELATIVE NEGLECT OF THE PROSE POEM IN ENGLISH------------- IS ITS LASTING PRESENCE AS A SUBVERSIVE AND ALTERNATIVE POETIC TRADITION:------------- A PERMANENT SHADOW THROWN BY THE DOMINANCE OF FREE VERSE; A NIGGLING------------- OUTSIDER; AN EXOTIC AND POSSIBLY DECADENT THIRD WAY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN------------- PROSE AND POETRY.------------------------------------- ALL OF THE WOMEN I MENTION ABOVE HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE FORM SINCE----------- AT LEAST THE EARLY 1980S. ALL OF THEM AT ONE STAGE BELONGED TO THE SYDNEY----------- WOMEN WRITERS' WORKSHOP, A WORKSHOP CHARACTERISED AS FEMINIST AND EXPERIMENTAL-----------, AND ONE OF ITS AIMS FOR BEING SET UP WAS TO COUNTER PATRIARCHAL PRACTICES----------- IN WRITING AND PUBLISHING. THE FOUR WOMEN MENTIONED HAVE, BETWEEN THEM-----------, HAVE PUBLISHED OVER 20 BOOKS.---------------- HAMPTON'S FIRST BOOK COSTUMES (1981) CONTAINED SOME PROSE POEMS GEMS----------- SUCH AS 'THE KITCHEN OF AUNTY MI AND AUNTY PEARL', AND HER LATEST FANTASTIC----------- BOOK,---- A LATIN PRIMER----- (CERBERUS 1998), COULD BE SAID TO CONTAIN----------- ONE LONG EXTENDED (BRILLIANT) PROSE POEM.---------------- BROPHY ASKS AND ANSWERS HIS QUESTION:--------------------------------------- WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE THEN TO BE WRITING A PROSE POEM?----------------------------------------------------- IN HER STATEMENT IN---- POETRY AND GENDER----- BURNS SAYS:--------------------------------------- THE PROSE POEM, THE POEM IN THE PROSE IS MORE HUMBLE, OR PERHAPS------------- MORE PATIENT, MORE SUBTLE. IT KNOWS THE POTENTIAL, THE FREEDOM OF------------- NOT BEING TOO OBVIOUS. THE PROSE POEM SAYS FIND ME.-------------------------------------- ANNA GIBBS NOTED IN HER PAPER ON FEMINISM AND FICTOCRITICISM (TEXT----------- OCTOBER 1997): HTTP://WWW.GU.EDU.AU/SCHOOL/ART/TEXT/OCT-----------------------------97/GIBBS.HTM---------------- THAT THE PROSE POEM IS ONE OF THE 'INDETERMINATE FORMS' OF 'LITERARY----------- DETRITUS' THAT FICTOCRITICISM MAKES USE OF.
