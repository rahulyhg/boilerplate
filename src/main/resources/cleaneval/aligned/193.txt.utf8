THE AUTHORS INTENDED TO DEVELOP THE-BELMONT REPORT INTO A BOOK, BUT DID NOT DO SO FOR REASONS THAT REMAIN UNKNOWN-BUT SHOULD BECOME APPARENT TO THE READER UPON DISCOVERY OF THE VARIOUS-CONNECTIONS OF THE JBS FOUNDERS. SINCE THE JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY SUCCESSFULLY-LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF CHRISTIANS THROUGH THE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE-MOVEMENT, THE BELMONT BROTHERHOOD IS MUST READING FOR EVERY CHRISTIAN:------------------------HTTP://WATCH-UNTO-PRAYER.ORG/BELMONT.HTML---------------------------------------  THE PASSAGE WHICH INTRIGUED US IS FOUND UNDER-SECTION #5 -- A PROFILE OF FORMER JBS NATIONAL COUNCILMAN, J. NELSON SHEPHERD-,WHO BELONGED TO THE VERY ELITE NEWCOMEN SOCIETY. THIS MYSTERIOUS SOCIETY-WAS TO BE EXPOSED BY AUTHORS OF THE BELMONT BROTHERHOOD IN THEIR BOOK WHICH-NEVER MATERIALIZED, AND THERE IS SCANT INFORMATION AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE.-THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEWCOMEN SOCIETY FOR SOME LENGTH OF TIME WAS CHARLES-PENROSE, JR. WHO WAS ALSO A MEMBER OF TWO HIGH-LEVEL, SUBVERSIVE AND ONE-WORLD-SOCIETIES IN THE U.S. KNOWN AS THE----------------------- PILGRIM-SOCIETY AND THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING UNION----.------ WE HAVE ALREADY POSTED-TWO REPORTS BY ERIC SAMUELSON ABOUT THESE SOCIETIES, WHICH HAVE THEIR ORIGINS-IN THE CECIL RHODES-MILNER ROUND TABLE GROUP OF GREAT BRITAIN, WHICH PURPOSE-WAS TO REESTABLISH THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS AND, ULTIMATELY-,TO BRING THE WORLD UNDER THE DOMINATION OF A RESTORED BRITISH EMPIRE.-----------------------------------  WHAT CECIL RHODES AND ALFRED MILNER HAD IN-MIND WAS THE FORMATION OF A MASTER/SLAVE SOCIETY BASED UPON THE PRINCIPLES-OF EUGENICS AS DERIVED FROM PLATO'S REPUBLIC.---------------------------------------------------------MALTHUSIAN-EUGENICS---- IS THE PHILOSOPHY OF DEPOPULATION THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF-INFERIOR RACES --"HUMAN WEEDS"-- AND THE SELECTIVE BREEDING OF "A RACE-OF THOROUGHBREDS" AS DESCRIBED EARLY IN THIS CENTURY BY ROCKEFELLER-FUNDED-,PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOUNDER, MARGARET SANGER. WHEN THOMAS MALTHUS' THEORY-OF POPULATION WAS LATER COUPLED WITH CHARLES DARWIN'S EVOLUTIONARY MODEL-,THE RESULT WAS KNOWN AS SOCIAL DARWINISM.--------------------------------------------  THE COMBINATION OF MALTHUSIAN POPULATION-CONTROL, WHICH INCLUDED THE--------------------------------------------- DELIBERATE-NEGLECT OF POPULATIONS AND INDIRECT METHODS OF KILLING OFF POPULATION--------------------------------------,WITH DARWINISM, PRODUCED NATIONAL SOCIALISM (GERMANY), INTERNATIONAL SOCIALISM-(MARXIST RUSSIA) AND INTERNATIONAL CORPORATE CAPITALISM (GLOBAL SOCIALISM-,HEADQUARTERED IN THE UNITED STATES), AND THESE FORMS OF SOCIAL CONDUCT-HAVE CONSTITUTED THE MAIN REASON FOR THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF PLANETARY-RESOURCES, FAMINES, PLANNED BIOLOGICAL WAREFARE, ENVIRONMENTAL POISONING-,SUPPRESSION OF KNOWLEDGE, SUPPRESSION OF INVENTIONS, DEPENDENCE ON BACKWARD-TECHNOLOGY FOR THE POPULATION, PLANNED WARS TO KILL OFF POPULATIONS AND-GENERAL PLANETARY DISORDER. THE PROBLEM IS IN THE SOCIAL DARWIN-MALTHUS-PARADIGM, WHICH HAS NOW BEEN COMBINED WITH THE PSEUDO-SCIENCES OF BEHAVIORISM-AND GENETICS IN THE ATTEMPT TO ASSERT EVEN TIGHTER CONTROL OVER THE PLANETARY-POPULATION, YIELDING FORMS OF NEO-DARWINISM BEING PERPETRATED BY A HOST-OF POST-ATLANTEAN RE-TREADS, PER A 1947 PRINCETON CONSENSUS.---------------------------------------------  MALTHUSIAN EUGENICS HAS LONG CAPTIVATED THE IMAGINATIONS-OF THE VERY ELITE WHO CONTROL THE WORLD'S WEALTH AND POWER STRUCTURES.-NEARLY TWO CENTURIES OF APPLIED PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL DARWINISM HAVE POSITIONED-THE WORLD WHEREBY THE EMPOWERED ELITE CLASSES MAY GOVERN THE SLAVE RACE-THEY CREATE TO LABOR UNDER THEIR MONOPOLIST CAPITALIST RULE. SINCE THE-ORDERS OF FREEMASONRY LARGELY COMPRISE THE RULING ELITE WHICH OWNS THE-TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS, A MASONIC HISTORY OF---------------------------------------------------------- THE-ROUND TABLE---- IS INSTRUCTIVE:--------------------------------------------  THROUGHOUT MOST THE NINETIETH CENTURY-,FRENCH FREEMASONRY, AND NOT ENGLISH FREEMASONRY, WAS THE DOMINANT REVOLUTIONARY-FORCE IN THE OLD WORLD - OFFERING THE LOWER AND MIDDLE CLASSES A VOICE-IN GOVERNMENT. SINCE ITS BEGINNING IN 1717, THE BRITISH BROTHERHOOD WAS-ARISTOCRATIC, CAPITALIST, AND MONOPOLISTIC.----------------------------------------------------------  WHEN FRENCH GRAND ORIENT FREEMASONRY-SENT A GERMAN-BORN MASON, KARL MARX (1818 - 1883) TO ENGLAND TO AGITATE-THE LOWER CLASSES TO REBEL AGAINST THE BRITISH ARISTOCRACY, THE BRITISH-ARISTOCRACY BECAME CONCERNED. TO COUNTER THE INCREASINGLY INFLUENTIAL IDEOLOGY-OF FRENCH FREEMASONRY, IN 1870 A SELECT GROUP OF ENGLISH MASONRY DEVISED-A PLAN WHICH WOULD BOTH SATISFY THE PROLETARIAT AND KEEP THE MASONIC OLIGARCHY-IN POWER. THE SCHEME WAS INTRODUCED AT OXFORD, BY FREEMASON JOHN RUSKIN.----------------------------------------------------------  RUSKIN'S INSPIRATION AND DEVOTION-TO THE CREATION OF AN ELITE OF RACE PATRIOTS DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM PLATO'S-REPUBLIC. IN THE REPUBLIC, PLATO CALLED FOR "A RULING CLASS WITH A POWERFUL-ARMY TO KEEP IT IN POWER AND A SOCIETY COMPLETELY SUBORDINATE TO THE MONOLITHIC-AUTHORITY OF THE RULERS.- RUSKIN SENT OUT TO RECOUP AND EXTEND THE INFLUENCE-OF BRITISH MASONRY. HE WANTED TO DO THIS BY EDUCATION OF THE WORKING MAN.-HIS VIEWS ON THE RULING CLASS AS DEVELOPED FROM PLATO'S REPUBLIC, SENT-SHOCK WAVES THROUGH OXFORD.----------------------------------------------------------  "[YOU, THE UNDERGRADUATES ARE] THE-POSSESSORS OF A MAGNIFICENT TRADITION OF EDUCATION, BEAUTY, RULE OF LAW-,FREEDOM, DECENCY AND SELF-DISCIPLINE BUT... THIS TRADITION [CAN] NOT BE-SAVED, AND DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE SAVED, UNLESS IT CAN BE EXTENDED TO THE-LOWER CLASSES IN ENGLAND ITSELF AND TO THE NON-ENGLISH MASSES THROUGHOUT-THE WORLD. IF THIS PRECIOUS TRADITION IS NOT EXTENDED TO THESE TWO GREAT-MAJORITIES, THE MINORITY OF UPPER-CLASS ENGLISHMEN WILL ULTIMATELY BE SUBMERGED-BY THESE MAJORITIES AND THE TRADITION LOST. TO PREVENT THIS, THE TRADITION-MUST BE EXTENDED TO THE MASSES AND TO THE EMPIRE.----------------------------------------------------------"  RUSKIN'S RATIONALE FOR PROCLAIMING-SUCH IDEAS WAS TO PLANT IN THE FERTILE MINDS OF HIS OXFORD STUDENTS THE-THEORY THAT IF THEY EDUCATED THE WORKING MAN AND ELEVATED HIM TO THE MIDDLE-CLASS, HE WOULD LABOR IN BEHALF OF THE ARISTOCRACY TO PERPETUATE THE TRADITION-OF THE UPPER-CLASS ENGLISHMEN - WHICH TRADITION WAS TO CONTROL THE FINANCES-OF NATIONS THROUGH GROUND RENT--BANKING AND TRADE. RUSKIN TAUGHT THAT IT-WAS THE ESSENTIAL DUTY OF THE ARISTOCRACY TO GUARANTEE AN EDUCATION FOR-THE SO THAT AN EXPANDED MIDDLE CLASS WOULD RULE THE COUNTRY. THIS ARRANGEMENT-WOULD BE A TYPE OF LEGAL SLAVERY WHEREBY BOTH CLASSES WOULD BENEFIT. THROUGH-THE POWER OF FINANCE, THE RULING CLASS WOULD MAINTAIN CONTROL FROM BEHIND-THE SCENES, WHILE THE-WORKING CLASS WOULD HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE IN-THE COMMON WEALTH MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH LOANS.----------------------------------------------------------  RUSKIN SUCCESSFULLY TRANSMITTED HIS-VISION-TO HIS STUDENTS AT OXFORD. THEY IN TURN BECAME THE MASONIC MOVERS AND SHAKERS-IN THE NEW POLITICS AND ECONOMICS THAT TODAY GOVERN THE SEVEN INDUSTRIAL-NATIONS OF THE WORLD - THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, ENGLAND, GERMANY, FRANCE-,ITALY, AND JAPAN.----------------------------------------------------------  A WEALTHY YOUNG MAN, CECIL RHODES-,LIKE JOHN RUSKIN BELIEVED THAT ONLY THE BRITISH ELITE COULD AND SHOULD-RULE THE WORLD TO THE BENEFIT AND HAPPINESS OF MANKIND. SHORTLY AFTER ARRIVING-AT OXFORD, RHODES WAS INITIATED INTO FREEMASONRY AT THE APOLLO UNIVERSITY-LODGE NO-----. ON APRIL 17, 1877, HE WAS RAISED A MASTER MASON IN THE SAME-LODGE. RHODES ALSO JOINED A SCOTTISH RITE LODGE AT OXFORD CALLED PRINCE-ROSE CROIX LODGE NO.--------------------------------------------------------------  WHAT SORT OF CHARACTER WAS CECIL-RHODES? RHODES WAS A CRITIC OF ENGLISH FREEMASONRY - OF ITS IMPOTENCE AND-INCOMPETENCE IN ADVANCING BRITISH RACE INTEREST. AFTER BEING RAISED TO-MASTER MASON ON APRIL 17, 1877, RHODES DRAFTED A PROGRAM FOR WORLD DOMINION-BY THE BRITISH RACE PATRIOTS. TO GUARANTEE THE FUNDING FROM HIS VAST WEALTH-OF HIS WORLD VISION FOR THE BRITISH EMPIRE, RHODES WROTE IN 1877 THE FIRST-OF SEVEN WILLS THAT HE COMPOSED OVER HIS LIFETIME. THE FIRST WILL CALLED-FOR THE FORMATION OF A "SECRET SOCIETY" WHOSE PRIMARY FUNCTION WOULD BE-FOCUSED ON RETURNING ENGLAND TO HER FORMER GLORY. HE VIEWED ENGLISH FREEMASONRY-AND ITS CONSPIRACY AS IMPOTENT AND IN EFFECT DEFUNCT IN THIS REGARD. IRONICALLY-,WHEN THE SOCIETY RHODES HAD ENVISIONED WAS FINALLY ORGANIZED AFTER HIS-DEATH, ITS MEMBERSHIP CONSISTED ONLY OF ENGLISH FREEMASONS. "THE ROUND-TABLE," AS IT WAS KNOWN, SOON BECAME THE MOST POWERFUL APPENDAGE OF THE-BRITISH BROTHERHOOD.----------------------------------------------------------  IN HIS THIRD WILL RHODES LEFT HIS-ENTIRE ESTATE TO FREEMASON LORD NATHAN ROTHSCHILD AS TRUSTEE. RHODES STIPULATED-THAT HIS GIGANTIC FORTUNE BE USED BY HIS DISCIPLES TO CARRY OUT THE PROGRAM-HE ENVISIONED. ROTHSCHILD APPOINTED FREEMASON ALFRED MILNER TO HEAD UP-THE SECRET SOCIETY FOR WHICH RHODES'S FIRST WILL MADE-PROVISION. LORD MILNER-ONCE REMARKED OF HIMSELF, "MY PATRIOTISM KNOWS NO GEOGRAPHICAL BUT ONLY-RACIAL LIMITS. I AM A BRITISH RACE PATRIOT.----------------------------------------------------------"  UPON HIS APPOINTMENT BY ROTHSCHILD-TO CHAIR RHODES'S SECRET SOCIETY, MILNER RECRUITED A GROUP OF YOUNG MEN-FROM OXFORD AND TONYBEE HALL TO ASSIST HIM IN ORGANIZING HIS ADMINISTRATION-OF THE NEW SOCIETY. ALL WERE RESPECTED ENGLISH FREEMASONS. AMONG THEM-WERE-RUDYARD KIPLING, ARTHUR BALFOUR, LORD ROTHSCHILD, AND SOME OXFORD COLLEGE-GRADUATES KNOWN AS "MILNER'S KINDERGARTEN."-IN 1909, MILNER'S KINDERGARTEN-,WITH SOME OTHER ENGLISH MASONS, FOUNDED THE ROUND TABLE. THE GRANDFATHER-OF ALL MODERN BRITISH MASONIC "THINK TANKS" WAS BORN.----------------------------------------------------------  THREE POWERFUL THINK TANK OFFSHOOTS-OF THE ROUND TABLE ARE (---THE ROYAL INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS-(RIIA), ORGANIZED IN 1919 IN LONDON; (2) THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS-(CFR), ORGANIZED IN 1921 IN NEW YORK CITY; AND (3) THE INSTITUTE OF PACIFIC-RELATIONS (IPR), ORGANIZED IN 1925 OR THE TWELVE COUNTRIES HOLDING TERRITORY-IN WHAT TODAY WE CALL THE PACIFIC RIM.----------------------------------------------------------  THE INITIAL ASSIGNMENT OF THE ROUND-TABLE WAS NOT NECESSARILY TO DESTROY THE POLITICAL EXPERIMENTS OF FRENCH-FREEMASONRY, SUCH AS SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM, BUT TO COOPERATE WITH THEM-FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE ENGLISH MASONIC CONSPIRACY.----------------------------------------------------------  SOME SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THE ORGANIZATION-OF THE ROUND TABLE, OF WHICH H.G. WELLS WOULD BE A FOUNDING MEMBER, WELLS-EXPLAINED THE STRATEGY BY WHICH ARISTOCRATIC ENGLISH FREEMASONRY WOULD-REACH ITS GOAL OF WORLD DOMINION. HE CALLED IT AN "OPEN CONSPIRACY" AS-OPPOSED TO FRENCH FREEMASONRY'S CLOSED OR SECRET CONSPIRACY.----------------------------------------------------------  "THE OPEN CONSPIRACY WILL APPEAR-FIRST, I BELIEVE, AS A CONSCIOUS ORGANIZATION OF INTELLIGENT AND QUITE-POSSIBLY IN SOME CASES WEALTHY MEN, AS A MOVEMENT HAVING DISTINCT SOCIAL-AND POLITICAL AIMS . . .---------------------------------------------"  H.G.

ALL OF THEM, MOREOVER, SHARED SIDNEY [WEBB]'S BELIEF -- WHICH-HAD LED HIM TO SPEND SO MUCH EFFORT ON LONDON EDUCATION AND ON THE SCHOOL-OF ECONOMICS -- THAT SOCIAL IMPROVEMENT DEPENDED UPON THE TRAINING OF THE-SUPERIOR MANPOWER NEEDED TO CARRY OUT SCHEMES OF REFORM.
