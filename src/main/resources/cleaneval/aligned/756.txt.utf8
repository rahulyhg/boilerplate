CHOOSING GOOD CONDITIONS IS IMPORTANT: NOT ONLY YOU SEE THE AURA BETTER-, BUT ALSO TO GAIN A CONFIDENCE ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE.-----------SITUATE THE PERSON IN FRONT OF A VERY SOFTLY ILLUMINATED PLAIN WHITE BACKGROUND.- A COLOR BACKGROUND WILL CHANGE AURA COLORS--SO YOU NEED ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT- COMBINING COLORS. SOME COMBINATIONS OF BACKGROUND AND AURA COLORS MAY-CAUSE MISINTERPRETATION- PROBLEMS.-------------- CHOOSE ONE SPOT TO LOOK AT. THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREHEAD IS VERY GOOD. THIS- IS A LOCATION OF SO CALLED BROW-CHAKRA OR THE THIRD EYE. IN-SOME CULTURES (INDIA---THEY PUT A MARK ON A FOREHEAD. SUCH A-MARK IN ANCIENT TIMES COULD MEAN THE INVITATION- TO LOOK AND SEE THE AURA.-------------- LOOK AT THIS SPOT FOR 30 TO 60 SECONDS OR LONGER-------------- AFTER 30 SECONDS ANALYZE SURROUNDINGS WITH YOUR PERIPHERAL VISION, WHILE STILL- LOOKING AT THE SAME SPOT.-------- CONTINUING THE CONCENTRATION IS MOST IMPORTANT.- RESIST TEMPTATION TO LOOK AROUND.--------- YOU SHOULD SEE THAT THE BACKGROUND- NEARBY THE PERSON IS BRIGHTER AND HAS A DIFFERENT COLOR THAN THE BACKGROUND FURTHER- AWAY. THIS IS YOUR OWN PERCEPTION OF THE AURA. THE LONGER YOU CONCENTRATE, THE- BETTER YOU WILL SEE IT. REMEMBER, CONCENTRATION ON ONE SPOT INCREASES YOUR SENSITIVITY- BY ACCUMULATING THE EFFECT OF THE AURA VIBRATION REACHING YOUR EYES.------------------- TAKING A SNAPSHOT OF AN AURA.------------------ AFTER CONCENTRATING LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THE AURA, CLOSE YOUR EYES. FOR A SECOND- OR TWO YOU WILL SEE THE AURA ONLY. BE PREPARED. YOU-HAVE ONLY ONE SECOND OR TWO- UNTIL YOUR PHOTOSENSITIVE CELLS WILL STOP VIBRATING AND SENDING VISUAL SENSATIONS- TO THE BRAIN. AND IF YOU MISS IS, YOU HAVE TO START CONCENTRATING AGAIN. TRY TO- EXPERIMENT HOW FAST OR SLOW YOU SHOULD CLOSE YOUR EYES.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OBSERVING AURAS OF OTHER PEOPLE------------------ THE BEST IS TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT SOMEONE'S BROW CHAKRA (THIRD EYE OR WISDOM EYE-, WHICH IS LOCATED @1.5 CM ABOVE THE NOSE, BETWEEN EYES) AND AIM TO ACHIEVE THE- STATE OF MIND SIMILAR TO THE CONCENTRATION TECHNIQUE DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR AT LEAST- 30-60 SECONDS. I HAVE TRIED ALSO LOOKING AT THROAT AND HEART CHAKRAS WITH SIMILAR- RESULTS. HOWEVER, IF YOU CONCENTRATE ON SOMEONE'S CHEST IT LOOKS SO UNUSUAL THAT- THE PERSON CONCERNED IS USUALLY VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT. WHEN YOU LOOK INTO SOMEONE'S- BROW CHAKRA YOU CAN ACTUALLY CONTINUE CONVERSATION.--------- AGAIN, VERY SOFTLY ILLUMINATED BACKGROUND, WITH NO SHADOWS IS BEST. WITH PRACTICE-, ANY UNIFORMLY ILLUMINATED BACKGROUND (SUCH AS A BLUE SKY FOR EXAMPLE) WILL SUFFICE.----------------- HOW TO SEE YOUR OWN AURA------------------ STAND ABOUT 1.5 M IN FRONT OF A GOOD SIZE MIRROR. IN THE BEGINNING IT IS BEST- IF THE BACKGROUND BEHIND YOU IS PLAIN WHITE AND THERE ARE NO SHADOWS.-ILLUMINATION- SHOULD BE VERY SOFT AND UNIFORM-NOT BRIGHT. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ABOVE-FOR SEEING- AURAS.--------- PRACTICE FOR AT LEAST 1-----MINUTES-EACH DAY TO INCREASE YOUR SENSITIVITY AND- DEVELOP AURIC SIGHT. REMEMBER THAT PRACTICE IS-REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AURIC SIGHT.----------------- AURIC SIGHT AND AFTER-IMAGES------------------- ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS DURING MY WORKSHOPS IS:----- "TOM-, ARE MY EYES PLAYING TRICKS ON ME ?-----" THE ANSWER IS NO, YOU HAVE JUST LEARNT- TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOUR EYES ARE CAPABLE OF. LIGHT SENSORS IN OUR EYES (RED- GREEN AND BLUE) ARE VIBRATION SENSORS WHICH ARE HIGHLY NON-LINEAR AND THEY HAVE- MEMORY. THE CONSEQUENCE OF MEMORY IS THAT THEY CAN OSCILLATE FOR UP TO SEVERAL- SECONDS AFTER THE VISUAL STIMULATION HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED.--------- THIS MEMORY OF VISUAL STIMULATION IS FREQUENTLY PERCEIVED AS AFTERIMAGE. AFTERIMAGES- HAVE A PRECISELY THE SAME SHAPE AS ORIGINAL IMAGES. AFTERIMAGE OF AN OBJECT SURROUNDED- BY ITS AURA IS LARGER THAN THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. THE INCREASE IN SUCH AFTERIMAGE--IS DUE TO THE VIBRATION OF AN AURA AND ACTUALLY REPRESENTS A----- "SNAPSHOT------" OF AN AURA. IT IS-THEREFORE ESSENTIAL TO FOCUS AT ONE SPOT WHEN WATCHING THE AURA- AND RESIST TEMPTATION TO CHANGE THE POINT OF FOCUS, OTHERWISE AN IMAGE OF THE- AURA MAY BECOME CONFUSED WITH THE AFTERIMAGE OF AN OBJECT.----------------- MEANING OF AURA AND ITS COLORS------------------ THE AURA IS A REFLECTION OF OUR TRUE NATURE AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT. AT THIS POINT- IT IS PERHAPS NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN WHAT DO I MEAN BY----- "TRUE NATURE-----" AND- WHY SOME EFFORT IS NECESSARY TO----- "DISCOVER-----" IT. OUR SOCIETY SEEMS TO- EMPHASIZE SYMBOLS, STEREOTYPES, HABITS, MANNERS, SUPERFICIAL BEHAVIOR, PRETENDING-, FOLLOWING OTHERS AND SUBMITTING FREE WILL TO SOME-------LEADERS-----". OUR----- "EDUCATION------" SEEMS TO BE BASED ON VIEWS AND EXPECTATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO TRY TO CONTROL THE FLOCK.--------- OUR TRUE NATURE IS WHAT IS-LEFT WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AND DISCARD ALL OUR HABITS-, STEREOTYPES, MANNERS, AND PRETENDING, SUPERFICIAL BEHAVIOR AND BECOME FULLY CONSCIOUS-, TRULY NATURAL AND SPONTANEOUS. NOTE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE SO ATTACHED TO THEIR- MANNERS AND HABITS THAT IT IS VERY HARD, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO DISCOVER WHO THEY- REALLY ARE. THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN INSTANT-INSIGHT INTO THEIR PERSONALITY SEEMS -TO BE BY WATCHING THEIR AURA, BECAUSE THE AURA SHOWS THEIR TRUE NATURE, BEHIND- ANY FACADE OF SUPERFICIAL BEHAVIOR.--------- IN GENERAL, THE MORE COLORFUL, CLEANER AND BRIGHTER THE AURA, THE BETTER AND MORE- SPIRITUALLY ADVANCED IS THE PERSON. ALSO, THE MORE UNIFORM THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION- IN THE AURA, THE HEALTHIER AND MORE BALANCED THE PERSON IS.--------- DISTRIBUTION OF THE ENERGY IN THE AURA SEEMS TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF A----------------------------------------------------- POWERFUL- MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC TOOL----, BUT USUALLY REQUIRES USING-A COMPLEX EQUIPMENT. THE--SCOPE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO CONCENTRATE ON WHAT WE CAN EASILY-SEE WITH OUR EYES.--------- OUR AURA SURROUNDS THE ENTIRE BODY, BUT THE INTERPRETATION OF COLORS BELOW RELATES- TO THE AURA AROUND THE HEAD ONLY. MEANING OF COLORS AROUND THE HEAD PRESENTED- BELOW SUGGESTED IN THE-LITERATURE HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE AUTHOR. WHEN YOU LEARN- TO SEE AURA WELL, YOU CAN VERIFY IT FOR YOURSELF,-BY CONCENTRATING ON CERTAIN- THOUGHTS WHILE WATCHING YOUR AURA, OR TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEIR THOUGHTS ARE WHEN- YOU SEE THEIR AURAS.--------- USUALLY, PEOPLE HAVE ONE OR TWO DOMINATING COLORS -STRONG POINTS) IN THEIR AURA.- THESE COLORS (OR THEIR AURIC PAIRS) WILL BE MOST LIKELY THEIR FAVORITE COLORS.--------- IN ADDITION TO DOMINANT COLORS, THE AURA REFLECTS THOUGHTS, FEELINGS AND DESIRES-, WHICH APPEAR LIKE----- "FLASHES------",---- "CLOUDS-----" OR----- "FLAMES------", USUALLY FURTHER AWAY FROM THE HEAD. FOR EXAMPLE A FLASH OF ORANGE IN THE AURA- INDICATES A THOUGHT OR DESIRE TO EXERCISE POWER AND CONTROL. ORANGE AS A DOMINANT- COLOR IS A SIGN OF POWER AND GENERAL ABILITY TO CONTROL PEOPLE. QUICKLY CHANGING------ "FLASHES-----" INDICATE QUICKLY CHANGING THOUGHTS.----------------- MEANING OF CLEAN COLORS OF THE AURA----- (COLORS OF THE RAINBOW, BRIGHT, SHINY, MONOCHROMATIC COLORS):-------------------------- PURPLE:--------- INDICATES SPIRITUAL THOUGHTS. PURPLE IS NEVER A STRONG- POINT IN THE AURA. IT APPEARS ONLY AS TEMPORARY----- "CLOUDS-----" AND----- "FLAMES------", INDICATING TRULY SPIRITUAL THOUGHTS.----------------- BLUE:--------- BALANCED EXISTENCE, SUSTAINING LIFE, EASED NERVE SYSTEM-, TRANSMITTING FORCES AND ENERGY. PEOPLE WITH BLUE STRONG POINT IN THEIR AURA ARE- RELAXED, BALANCED AND FEEL READY TO LIVE IN A CAVE AND SURVIVE. THEY ARE BORN- SURVIVORS. BLUE THOUGHT IS A THOUGHT ABOUT RELAXING THE NERVE SYSTEM TO ACHIEVE- THE BALANCE OF THE MIND OR A THOUGHT ABOUT SURVIVING. ELECTRIC BLUE CAN OVERRIDE- ANY OTHER COLOR IN THE AURA, WHEN THE PERSON IS RECEIVING AND/OR TRANSMITTING- INFORMATION IN A TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION. FOR EXAMPLE MICHEL DESMARQUET, AUTHOR- OF--------------------------------------- "THIAOOUBA PROPHECY---------", FREQUENTLY- GLOWS WITH THE ELECTRIC BLUE DURING HIS LECTURES, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ANSWERS QUESTIONS- FROM THE PUBLIC.----------------- TURQUOISE:--------- INDICATES DYNAMIC QUALITY OF BEING, HIGHLY ENERGIZED- PERSONALITY, CAPABLE OF PROJECTION, INFLUENCING OTHER PEOPLE. PEOPLE WITH TURQUOISE- STRONG POINT IN THEIR AURA CAN DO MANY THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ARE GOOD ORGANIZERS.- THEY FEEL BORED WHEN FORCED TO CONCENTRATE ON ONE THING. PEOPLE LOVE BOSSES WITH- TURQUOISE AURAS, BECAUSE SUCH BOSSES EXPLAIN THEIR GOALS AND INFLUENCE THEIR TEAM- RATHER THAN DEMAND EXECUTING THEIR COMMANDS. TURQUOISE THOUGHT IS A THOUGHT ABOUT- ORGANIZING AND INFLUENCING OTHERS.----------------- GREEN:--------- RESTFUL, MODIFYING ENERGY, NATURAL HEALING ABILITY. ALL- NATURAL HEALERS SHOULD HAVE IT. PEOPLE WITH A GREEN STRONG POINT IN THEIR AURAS- ARE NATURAL HEALERS. THE STRONGER THE GREEN AURA, THE BETTER THE HEALER. THEY- ALSO LOVE GARDENING AND USUALLY HAVE A----- "GREEN HAND-----" - ANYTHING GROWS- FOR THEM. BEING IN A PRESENCE OF A PERSON WITH A STRONG AND GREEN AURA IS A VERY- PEACEFUL AND RESTFUL EXPERIENCE. GREEN THOUGHT INDICATES A RESTFUL STATE AND HEALING.----------------- YELLOW:--------- JOY, FREEDOM, NON-ATTACHMENT, FREEING OR RELEASING VITAL- FORCES. PEOPLE WHO GLOW YELLOW ARE FULL OF INNER JOY, VERY GENEROUS AND NOT ATTACHED- TO ANYTHING. YELLOW HALO AROUND THE HEAD: HIGH-SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT. A SIGNATURE- OF A SPIRITUAL TEACHER. DO NOT ACCEPT SPIRITUAL TEACHINGS FROM ANYONE WHO DOES- NOT HAVE SUCH A YELLOW HALO. BUDDHA AND CHRIST HAD YELLOW HALOS EXTENDING TO THEIR- ARMS. TODAY IT IS RARE ON EARTH TO FIND A PERSON WITH A HALO LARGER THAN 1 INCH.--YELLOW HALO APPEARS AS-A RESULT OF A HIGHLY ACTIVE BROW CHAKRA (WHICH CAN BE SEEN- GLOWING WITH VIOLET BY MANY PEOPLE AT MY WORKSHOPS). HIGHLY SPIRITUAL PEOPLE STIMULATE- THE BROW CHAKRA CONTINUOUSLY FOR MANY YEARS, BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS HAVE INTENSIVE- SPIRITUAL THOUGHTS IN THEIR MINDS. WHEN THIS CHAKRA IS OBSERVED WHEN HIGHLY ACTIVE-, A YELLOW (AURIC PAIR) HALO APPEARS AROUND IT, SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE HEAD. YELLOW- THOUGHT INDICATES A MOMENT OF JOY AND-CONTENTMENT.----------------- ORANGE:--------- UPLIFTING AND ABSORBING. INSPIRING. A SIGN OF POWER.- ABILITY AND/OR DESIRE TO CONTROL PEOPLE. WHEN-ORANGE BECOMES A STRONG POINT, IT- USUALLY CONTRIBUTES TO A YELLOW HALO, WHICH THEN BECOMES GOLD, INDICATING NOT- ONLY A SPIRITUAL TEACHER, BUT A POWERFUL SPIRITUAL TEACHER, SOMEONE CAPABLE OF- DEMONSTRATING HIS/HER UNIQUE ABILITIES. ORANGE THOUGHT IS A THOUGHT ABOUT EXERCISING- POWER OR A DESIRE TO CONTROL PEOPLE.----------------- RED:--------- MATERIALISTIC THOUGHTS, THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PHYSICAL BODY.- PREDOMINANTLY RED AURA INDICATES MATERIALISTICALLY ORIENTED PERSON.----------------- PINK--------- (=PURPLE+RED): LOVE (IN A SPIRITUAL SENSE). TO OBTAIN A- CLEAN PINK, YOU NEED TO MIX THE PURPLE (THE-HIGHEST FREQUENCY WE PERCEIVE) WITH- RED (THE LOWEST FREQUENCY). PINK AURA INDICATES THAT THE PERSON ACHIEVED A PERFECT- BALANCE BETWEEN SPIRITUAL AWARENESS AND THE MATERIAL EXISTENCE. THE MOST ADVANCED- PEOPLE HAVE NOT ONLY A YELLOW HALO AROUND THE HEAD (A PERMANENT-STRONG POINT IN- THE AURA) BUT ALSO A LARGE PINK AURA EXTENDING FURTHER AWAY. THE PINK COLOR IN- THE AURA IS QUITE RARE ON EARTH AND APPEARS ONLY AS A TEMPORARY THOUGHT, NEVER- AS A STRONG POINT IN THE AURA.---------------------------- MEANING OF DIRTY COLORS:-------------- (COLORS APPEARING DARKER THAN BACKGROUND MORE LIKE A SMOKE THAN A GLOW)----------------- BROWN:--------- UNSETTLING, DISTRACTING, MATERIALISTIC, NEGATING SPIRITUALITY.----------------- GRAY:--------- DARK THOUGHTS, DEPRESSING THOUGHTS, UNCLEAR INTENTIONS-, PRESENCE OF A DARK SIDE OF PERSONALITY.----------------- SULFUR--------- (COLOR OF A MUSTARD): PAIN OR LACK OF EASE, ANGER----------------- WHITE:--------- SERIOUS DISEASE, ARTIFICIAL STIMULATION (DRUGS). WHY DOES -THE WHITE COLOR IN THE AURA INDICATE PROBLEMS? WHITE COLOR IS LIKE A NOISE, RATHER- THAN A SET OF HARMONIOUS TONES (MONOCHROMATIC COLORS). IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO----- "TUNE------" THE NOISE TO AN ORCHESTRA PLAYING HARMONIOUS MUSIC, HENCE THE WHITE AURA INDICATES- A LACK OF HARMONY IN THE BODY AND MIND. NATURE, WHICH WE ARE A PART OF, IS HARMONIOUS.- THIS HARMONY COMES IN DISCRETE VIBRATION----- "TONES-----" OR HARMONICS, PARTIALLY- DESCRIBED BY THE MODERN QUANTUM PHYSICS.----- SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE THE DEATH, THE AURA BECOMES WHITE, AND GREATLY INCREASES- IN INTENSITY. FOR THIS REASON IN MOST CULTURES----- "DEATH-----" IS DEPICTED IN- WHITE (NOT BLACK), BECAUSE IN THE PAST, PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY SEE A WHITE AURA -BEFORE DEATH. IT SEEMS-THAT OUR ANCESTORS KNEW MUCH MORE THAN WE ARE PREPARED -TO ADMIT.----------------- AMPLIFYING YOUR AURA VIBRATION AND BIO-ENERGY------------------ THINGS WHICH CAN GREATLY AMPLIFY YOUR AURA ARE:---------------------------------------------------------- MEDITATION---- (PURIFYING- YOUR MIND FROM ANY THOUGHTS)------------------------------------------------------ CONCENTRATION EXERCISE---- WITH- THE CROSS--------------------------------------------------------------- MATCHING YOUR AURA WITH- THE ENVIRONMENT----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
