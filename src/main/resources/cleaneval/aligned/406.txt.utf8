-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I WAS BORN SEPTEMBER- 30,1955 AT------------------------------------------------------------- 11:07 P.M. WEIGHING 6 LBS- 11/4 OZ.---------------------------------------------------------------- I'VE GAINED WEIGHT SINCE-THEN....-------------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS IS A COLLECTION--IN NO PARTICULAR-ORDER--OF MY WEIGHT AT DIFFERENT AGES. AS YOU'LL SEE, MY BODY WEIGHT WAS-A DEFINING AND PERSISTENTLY PERVASIVE PART-OF MY LIFE FROM A VERY EARLY-AGE.------------------------------------------------------------ I AM THE FAT DAUGHTER OF A FAT-WOMAN WHO DESPERATELY WANTED TO SAVE ME FROM THE PAIN SHE'D SUFFERED AS-A CHILD, INCLUDING THE TAUNTS AND HATEFUL MESSAGES OF INADEQUACY AND UNDESIRABILITY-THAT CAME FROM--- HER---- MOTHER.------------------------------------------------------------ THESE WORDS ARE WRITTEN TO DOCUMENT----MY-LIFE EXPERIENCE---- AS A CHUBBY CHILD, FAT TEENAGER, AND SUPER-SIZED ADULT.-THERE IS NO BLAME, AND I AM NOT ANGRY AT MY MOTHER...THIS IS--- MY-----STORY, AND I THINK IT--- NEEDS---- TO BE TOLD. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE-NOT, AND/OR NEVER HAVE BEEN FAT, THE NUMBERS ALONE MAY NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH-INFORMATION OR INSIGHT. WHEREVER POSSIBLE, I AM INCLUDING CHILDHOOD PICTURES-WHICH CAN BE VIEWED BY CLICKING ON MY AGE AT-THE BEGINNING OF THE-PARAGRAPH.-I WILL ADD PICTURES-OVER TIME AS I FIND AND SCAN THEM.------------------------------------------------------------ PLEASE KEEP MY STORY IN MIND-WHEN JUDGING YOURSELF, OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE (WHICH ACTUALLY, SHOULD BE ONE-AND THE SAME;-) TEACH YOURSELF, AND THE FAT PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE THAT THEIR-VALUE SHOULD NOT BE DETERMINED BY THEIR BODY SHAPE, SIZE OR ANY OF A HUNDRED-OTHER VARIABLES. LEARN TO BE BEAUTIFUL, SMART AND STRONG ON THE INSIDE----FIRST----.-THIS WILL RADIATE FROM YOUR CENTER REGARDLESS OF YOUR PHYSICAL SIZE, AND----EVERYONE-----WILL KNOW HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE------------------------------------------------------------! IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE HOW I STARTED-OUT,------------------------------------------------------- CLICK HERE-----AND I WILL SHARE A FEW PICTURES OF MYSELF AS AN INFANT AND TODDLER.------------------------------------------------------------ AGE 5: WE LIVED IN GARDEN APARTMENTS-,AND AN OLDER BOY OF 7 NAMED KEVIN CALLED ME--- FAT----. SOMEONE TOLD ME-THAT HE DREW A PICTURE OF ME IN CHALK ON THE FRONT OF THE BRICK BUILDING.-IT WAS A CRUDE STICK FIGURE WITH A CIRCLE FOR THE HEAD AND A LARGER BUBBLE-FOR THE BODY. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER BEING CALLED--- FAT.---------------------------------------------------------------- AGE 7: DURING A TRIP TO THE DOCTOR-FOR MY USUAL EARACHE PROBLEMS, IT IS DECIDED THAT I SHOULD BE--- PUT---- ON-A DIET. I DON'T RECALL MY EXACT WEIGHT, BUT WHAT I--- DO---- REMEMBER IS-GOING HOME WITH A PIECE OF PAPER WHICH INSPIRED MY MOM TO GIVE ME A BOWL-OF WHEATIES WITH SKIM MILK AND--- NO SUGAR---- FOR DINNER. THE REST OF-THE FAMILY HAD STEAK, OR HAMBURGERS. I WAS--- MARKEDLY DIFFERENT---- FROM-THIS MOMENT ON.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AGE-----8: 88 LBS, I THINK. I HAVE A CLEAR, BUT DISTANT MEMORY OF BEING AT-MY COUSIN SELMA'S COUNTRY HOME, AND SHE GIVES ME A PAIR OF SHORTS TO TRY-ON. THEY DON'T FIT, AND SHE TELLS ME THAT A LITTLE GIRL MY AGE SHOULDN'T-WEIGH THIS MUCH, AND THAT IF I LOSE 40 LBS SHE WILL BUY ME ALL THE NEW-SHORTS I WANT...I--- ADORE---- SELMA, SO I PROMISE TO-DO IT--BECAUSE EVEN-THOUGH I'M SURE SHE LOVES ME, I'M SOMEHOW CERTAIN THAT SHE'LL LOVE ME--- MORE-----IF I'M NOT CHUBBY. DURING THIS SAME YEAR, I ALSO HAD DIET PILLS FOR THE----FIRST-----TIME.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AGE-----9: 121 LBS. MRS WISE'S FOURTH GRADE CLASS IS LINED UP OUTSIDE THE NURSE'S-OFFICE AT RIDGE RANCH SCHOOL IN PARAMUS, NJ. WE ARE BEING WEIGHED, AND-WHEN IT'S MY TURN, I AM LOGGED AT 121 LBS. THE NURSE POINTS OUT THAT I-WEIGH MORE THAN EVEN THE BIGGEST AND STRONGEST BOYS IN THE SCHOOL. I HEAR-SOME OF THE BOYS IN MY CLASS LAUGHING AND EXCLAIMING "WOW, WHAT A TUB OF-LARD--MASON WEIGHS OVER A HUNDRED POUNDS!" THIS FACT IS MENTIONED MUCH-MORE OFTEN THAN THE FACT THAT I LEARNED A MONOLOGUE--- IN NORWEGIAN------AS-WELL AS DESIGNING AND CREATING THE SCENERY FOR THE CLASS PLAY--A FEAT I-PERSONALLY FOUND MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE.------------------------------------------------------------ AGE 10: 131 LBS. MY MOTHER TAKES-ME TO DR DI DONATO BECAUSE I HAVE AN EARACHE. OF COURSE, I AM WEIGHED (EAR-INFECTIONS ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO FATNESS, RIGHT?) AND WHEN THE DOCTOR-COMES INTO THE EXAMINATION ROOM, HE SHAKES HIS HEAD IN DISGUST AND EXCLAIMS-,"131 POUNDS! MY NURSES DON'T WEIGH THAT MUCH!!!" I AM HUMILIATED, LOOKING-TO MY MOTHER FOR COMFORT--WHO IN TURN LOOKS AT THE DOCTOR AND SAYS, "DOCTOR-,DIDN'T YOU KNOW? SUSAN IS GOING TO BE WEARING--- MY---- CLOTHES TO SCHOOL-THIS FALL!" THE DOCTOR SEEMED TO IGNORE MY MOTHER'S REMARK, BUT SAYS "WE'VE-GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HER," AS THOUGH I WERE NOT EVEN PRESENT. I WAS-GIVEN DIET PILLS--- AGAIN----, AND I REMEMBER LATER THAT YEAR TELLING MY-TEACHER THAT I WASN'T TAKING THEM, BUT FLUSHING THEM DOWN THE TOILET. I-WAS PROUD OF THAT, HAVING READ THAT DIET PILLS CAN BE DANGEROUS...BUT I-DON'T THINK SHE SAW IT THAT WAY, AND THOUGH I'M NOT CERTAIN, I THINK SHE-MIGHT HAVE CALLED MY PARENTS AND TOLD THEM. WAS I CLAIRVOYANT, OR SIMPLY-"TOO SMART FOR MY OWN GOOD?------------------------------------------------------------" AGE 11: 156 LBS. MY SIXTH GRADE-TEACHER WAS MISS FOWLER, WHO WAS A BASTION OF STRICTNESS. SHE KEPT ME AFTER-SCHOOL ONE DAY TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THE GIRL SCOUTS--FROM WHICH I'D JUST-RESIGNED. MISS FOWLER TOLD ME THAT I WAS BRIGHT AND-TALENTED, AND OH, YEAH--I-HAD "SUCH A PRETTY FACE," BUT I HAD TO LOSE WEIGHT...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AGE-----12: 166 LBS. BEFORE SCHOOL STARTED, MY MOM TOOK ME SHOPPING FOR BACK-TO-SCHOOL-CLOTHES. SHE HELD UP A DRESS FOR MY APPROVAL. I GASPED AND SAID "I'M NOT-REALLY--- THAT---- WIDE!" MY MOTHER REPLIED, "YES, YOU ARE. WE RARELY SEE-OURSELVES AS WE REALLY ARE...THE WAY--- EVERYONE ELSE---- SEES US.------------------------------------------------------------ IT'S MY FIRST YEAR IN JUNIOR-HIGH SCHOOL. MR. CIRINELLI IS MY HOMEROOM TEACHER, AND HE TAKES IT UPON-HIMSELF TO MENTOR ME IN--- "YOU'D BETTER LOSE THAT WEIGHT NOW, 101.-----"HE-HAS JUST LOST 66 LBS ON WEIGHT WATCHERS, AND ENCOURAGES ME TO JOIN. SO-,I JOIN THE TEEN GROUP-OF WEIGHT WATCHERS THAT MEETS IN THE LUNCHROOM OF-ALEXANDER'S DEPARTMENT STORE ON FRIDAY NIGHTS.-THAT FIRST NIGHT, THEY WEIGH-ME AND-GIVE ME A REPORT CARD WHICH LOGS MY WEIGHT AND-PROGRESS AND ALSO-DISPLAYS MY GOAL WEIGHT, WHICH IS 88 LBS. THE WOMAN WHO WEIGHS ME IN SAYS--YOU HAVE TO LOSE A-WHOLE PERSON!" I WAS-VERY GUNG-HO FOR A WHILE, BUT-SLIPPED UP--NO, I--- CHEATED----! MR. CIRINELLI WARNED THAT I WAS GOING-TO RUIN MY LIFE IF I DIDN'T LOSE WEIGHT, AND MY MOTHER-TOLD ME THAT IT-WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR ME TO STICK TO THE DIET THAN FOR HER...MY WHOLE-LIFE WAS AHEAD OF ME, BUT HERS WAS ALREADY SETTLED. SHE WAS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AGE-----13: I'D JUST SURVIVED THE MOST--- INTERESTING---- SUMMER OF MY YOUNG-LIFE. MY PARENTS SENT ME TO DIET CAMP IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. I WAS ALMOST-200 LBS, BUT CAN'T RECALL THE EXACT NUMBER. I'D NEVER BEEN TO SLEEP-AWAY-CAMP BEFORE, BUT I WILLINGLY WENT SO THAT I COULD TRANSFORM MY LIFE AND-GUARANTEE MY FUTURE HAPPINESS THROUGH WEIGHT LOSS.------------------------------------------------------------ THE SHORT VERSION OF THIS STORY-IS THAT THE CAMP WAS A BROKEN DOWN HELL-HOLE, AND I RESPONDED APPROPRIATELY-TO THIS SITUATION WITH CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, A CORNERSTONE OF 60'S POLITICS-FOR CHANGE! THE RESULT? I WAS-EXPELLED FROM DIET CAMP. THE CAMP DIRECTOR-CALLED MY MOTHER AND SAID "YOU'VE GOT TO COME AND GET HER...SHE'S GOT HER-WHOLE BUNK ON STRIKE...GIRLS ARE REFUSING TO COME TO MEALS OR GO TO ACTIVITIES.-SUSAN HAS TURNED THIS PLACE UPSIDE DOWN AND DISRUPTED THE ENTIRE CAMP------------------------------------------------------------!" I WAS--- THRILLED---- TO BE LEAVING.-I SWORE I'D STICK TO MY DIET AND MAKE MY PARENTS PROUD. IT HAD BEEN THE-LONGEST FOUR WEEKS OF MY-LIFE, AND IT WASN'T UNTIL WE WERE A FEW HOURS-AWAY FROM THE CAMP THAT MY MOTHER TURNED TO ME IN ANGER AND SAID "WE DIDN'T-COME TO GET YOU BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH. WE CAME BECAUSE THE CAMP DIRECTOR-,SELMA ETTENBERG SAID YOU'D DISRUPTED THE ENTIRE CAMP, AND THEY COULD NOT-GET THINGS UNDER CONTROL UNTIL YOU WERE GONE------------------------------------------------------------!" ON THE SURFACE, I WAS DEVASTATED-AND EMBARRASSED...BUT UNDERNEATH, I WAS SMILING. IT WAS MY FIRST TASTE-OF POWER, AND I KNEW THAT I HAD BEEN--- RIGHT----------------------------------------------------------------! AGE 14: 257 LBS. MY FRESHMAN-YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND THE SCHOOL NURSE WEIGHS ME IN AT 257 LBS. I'D-BEEN ADMITTED TO BERGEN COUNTY VOCATIONAL---- & TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL IN-HACKENSACK, NJ. MY ENTRANCE EXAM SCORED IN THE TOP 10%.------ MY PLAN WAS-TO STUDY COMMERCIAL ART...BUT MY MEMORIES-OF DIETS AND FAT-BASHING ARE-MUCH MORE VIVID THAN ANYTHING I ACCOMPLISHED IN MY ACADEMIC CAREER--INCLUDING-RIBBONS WON IN A NATIONAL TEEN ARTS FESTIVAL, AND A VERY SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE-IN A ONE-ACT PLAY COMPETITION.------------------------------------------------------------ AFTER THE SUDDEN DEATH OF A BELOVED-SECOND COUSIN FROM CANCER, I WAS DETERMINED-TO LOSE THE WEIGHT "---SO MARTY-WOULD BE PROUD OF ME.------THAT WAS MY FIRST GO-ROUND WITH DR. STILLMAN.-HAMBURGERS, HOT DOGS, HARD-BOILED EGGS AND COTTAGE CHEESE, PLUS 8 GLASSES-OF WATER A DAY. I LOST ABOUT 30 LBS OR SO BEFORE I FALTERED.------------------------------------------------------------ AGE16: 311 LBS. IN AN OBESITY-CLINIC AT HACKENSACK HOSPITAL, I WEIGH IN AT 311 LBS. THE NURSE IN CHARGE-OF MY CASE IS VERY NICE. I LIKE HER A LOT, AND SHE CONVINCES ME THAT I-CAN DO THIS--MAYBE EVEN LOSE ENOUGH WEIGHT FOR SOMEONE TO ASK ME TO THE-PROM NEXT YEAR. HOW SAD...AFTER ALL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SELF-ESTEEM WOULD-HAVE GONE A LONG WAY IN MAKING ME DESIRABLE. AS USUAL, I LOSE--- SOME---- WEIGHT-,BUT IT'S NEVER ENOUGH.------ THIS IS ALSO THE YEAR THAT I AUDITIONED FOR-THE PART OF MAMA ROSE IN BERGEN TECH'S PRODUCTION OF "GYPSY.------" DESPITE-A STANDING OVATION FOR MY AUDITION, I DIDN'T GET THE PART--BECAUSE OF MY-WEIGHT.------ I WAS TOLD THAT I JUST DIDN'T FIT THE IMAGE OF MAMA ROSE-BECAUSE OF MY SIZE.------ OY.------------------------------------------------------------ AGE 17: 321 LBS. OUR FAMILY BELONGED-TO A CAMPING CLUB, AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE--- JERSEY SKEETERS---- WAS-A WOMAN NAMED CAROL. SHE WAS WELL OVER 300 LBS, WITH A HUSBAND AND CHILDREN-WHO ADORED HER. SUDDENLY DURING THE LAST YEAR OR SO, SHE GOT THIN. ON WEIGHT-WATCHERS, OF COURSE...SO NOW THAT I-HAD MY DRIVERS LICENSE--I JOINED THE-CLASS THAT CAROL LECTURED. SHE TOLD-ME HOW MUCH EVERYONE-IN THE CLASS ADORED-ME, AND HOW MUCH THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD, TOO--ONCE I'D LOST THE WEIGHT.-SHE WANTED TO MAKE A GIANT POSTER OF MY "REPORT CARD" TO MOTIVATE ME AND-HELP THE CLASS MONITOR MY PROGRESS. DUH. CAN YOU SAY--- "MAKE AN EXAMPLE-OF ME, AND HUMILIATE ME ANY WAY YOU CAN?----" A COUPLE OF MONTHS, AND I-WAS GONE------------------------------------------------------------! AGE 17 3/4: 356 LBS. MY MOTHER-WORKED AT CASTRO CONVERTIBLES IN PARAMUS, NJ. SHE WAS THEIR FIRST FEMALE-SALESPERSON, AND SHE WAS FAT.------------------------------------------------------------ ONE DAY, I'M IN THE STORE TO-SEE HER, AND I NOTICE THIS MAN WATCHING-ME. I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY HE WAS-LOOKING AT ME, BUT I IGNORED HIM BECAUSE I WAS IN MY MOM'S PLACE OF BUSINESS.------------------------------------------------------------ THAT NIGHT, SHE TELLS ME THE-STRANGE MAN WAS BOB, AND HE'D TAKEN AN INTEREST IN ME BECAUSE HE'D LOST-OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS ON WEIGHT WATCHERS. SO...A FEW DAYS AFTER-HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION, I JOIN YET ANOTHER WEIGHT WATCHERS GROUP AND WEIGH-IN AT 356 LBS. BOB ASSURES ME THAT IF I DO THE RIGHT THING, I'LL LOSE WEIGHT-AND SOMEDAY, MAYBE EVEN HAVE A BOYFRIEND. IF I DON'T, I'LL NEVER BE HAPPY.------------------------------------------------------------ AGE 19: 375 1/2 LBS. I AM ACCEPTED-FOR PARTICIPATION IN AN OBESITY RESEARCH PROGRAM AT THE NEW YORK STATE-PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE AT COLUMBIA PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL IN NEW YORK CITY.-BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION, INCARCERATION AND THE FEAR OF BEING INTEGRATED WITH-,OR MISTAKEN FOR A MEMBER OF THE GENERAL PSYCHIATRIC POPULATION-----THESE-WERE A FEW OF MY FAVORITE THINGS.---------------------------------------------------------------- I STAYED FOR THE BETTER PART-OF SIX MONTHS AND LOST 88 1/2 LBS. I WAS UNDER 300 LBS FOR THE FIRST TIME-SINCE THE AGE OF 16...------------------------------------------------------------ AGE 20?: 375ISH...AGAIN. FOLLOWING-AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT AND SERIOUS BACK INJURY, I LAND IN A DRUG REHAB-IN MIAMI, FL ON MAY 20, 1976 BECAUSE MY MOTHER HAS CONVINCED THEM THAT-MY COMPULSIVE EATING IS COMPARABLE TO CHEMICAL ABUSE.--- I'M ADMITTED BECAUSE-THE PAPERWORK GOES THROUGH, AND THE PROGRAM GETS THE BUCKS.---------------------------------------------------------------- THIS PLACE MAKES THE DIET CAMP-LOOK LIKE PARADISE. THE FOOD IS HORRENDOUS--THE FACILITY (AN OLD-MOTEL-JUST A BLOCK OFF OF BISCAYNE BAY) IS ROACH INFESTED, AND WORSE...AND A-SELF-IMPOSED REGIMEN OF ARBITRARY FASTING IS--- EASY.---- YEAH, I LOST-WEIGHT. AND THEN I REGAINED IT...------------------------------------------------------------ AGE 22/23: STILL IN MIAMI, NOW----WORKING-----IN THE PROGRAM. ONE OF THE DIRECTORS DECIDES THAT I HAVE TO LOSE WEIGHT-TO SET AN EXAMPLE FOR OUR CLIENTS, SO UNDER THE THREAT OF "LOSE WEIGHT-,OR LOSE YOUR JOB," I GO TO MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL ON MIAMI BEACH AND ENROLL-IN THE OPTIFAST PROGRAM.------------------------------------------------------------ DAVID KUDZMA, MY DOCTOR IS VERY-COOL. HE'S SEARING, SARCASTIC AND TAUNTS ME, TELLING ME I'LL NEVER SUCCEED.-I DID THOUGH...I LOST 67 1/2 LBS, AND HE ADMITTED THAT HE--- MIGHT---- HAVE-BEEN WRONG. IN THE LONG RUN, HE WASN'T. AND I ALREADY HAD THE SEEDS OF-ANOREXIC AND BULIMIC BEHAVIORS PLANTED WITHIN ME. I WASN'T DRINKING MY-5 PACKETS A DAY, THINKING THAT SOMEHOW IF I CUT THE 350 CALORIES A DAY-IN HALF, I'D LOSE MORE WEIGHT...FASTER. I ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER-NEARLY PASSING OUT--REPEATEDLY OVER A PERIOD OF A WEEK OR SO. I WAS TOO-WEAK TO DRIVE TO THE HOSPITAL, SO A FRIEND BROUGHT ME. I KEELED OVER IN-DR. KUDZMA'S OFFICE. I REMEMBER "SPIRALING" TOWARD THE FLOOR, AND THE NEXT-THING I REMEMBERED WAS WONDERING HOW, IF I WAS ON THE FLOOR, THE CEILING-SEEMED SO CLOSE...(I WAS ACTUALLY BEING WHEELED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM ON-A GURNEY. I NEVER ASKED, AND DON'T THINK I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY GOT ME-UP OFF OF THE FLOOR.)------------------------------------------------------------ ONCE I'D RECOVERED FROM WHAT-WAS REFERRED TO AS AN "UNKNOWN VIRAL THING," I AM DETERMINED TO RESUME-MY DIET. I BEG FOR AN APPOINTMENT WITH A STAFF SURGEON WHO WILL PERFORM-A GASTRO-INTESTINAL BYPASS ON ME.------------------------------------------------------------ THE SURGEON TELLS ME ABOUT ALL-OF THE RISKS, PRESUMABLY TO SCARE ME, BUT I AM NOT AFRAID. "I AM GOING-TO DIE ANYWAY," I TELL HIM. "JUST DO IT." HE REFUSED. I'LL BET THAT'S A-RECORD, HUH? HIS NAME WAS DR. ACKROYD AND HE WAS AT MOUNT SINAI, TOO. I-HATED HIM THAT DAY...BUT IF I COULD THANK HIM NOW, I WOULD.------------------------------------------------------------ AGE 24: 433 LBS. I COULDN'T BELIEVE-I'D BROKEN THE 400 POUND MARK, AND WITH THE BLESSING OF THE DOCTOR BY WHOM-I WAS EMPLOYED, I EMBARKED ON A HIGH PROTEIN, LOW CARBOHYDRATE DIET. WHEN-THAT DIDN'T YIELD LONG LASTING RESULTS, I HAD MY JAWS WIRED SHUT. I LOST-ABOUT 22 LBS IN 8 WEEKS. EVERY MORNING, I BEAT A RAW EGG INTO A GLASS OF-ORANGE JUICE. I DON'T KNOW HOW I SURVIVED--PHYSICALLY, OR EMOTIONALLY.-ONE OF THE THINGS ONE MUST DO WHEN THEIR JAWS ARE WIRED IS KEEP A PAIR-OF WIRE CUTTERS HANDY IN CASE THE VICTIM--ER, DIETER, THAT IS, BEGINS TO-VOMIT. THE WIRES MUST BE CUT TO AVOID CHOKING ON ONES OWN VOMIT. (IF THIS-FRIGHTENS OR MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, GOOD. IT OUGHT TO. I WISH I'D BEEN-FRIGHTENED INSTEAD OF DESPERATE.)------------------------------------------------------------ I HAD TO HAVE THE WIRES CUT TO-HAVE EMERGENCY DENTAL SURGERY, AND CHOSE NOT TO GET THEM RE-WIRED. A YEAR-OR SO LATER, I ASKED A DENTIST TO REMOVE THE BRACES BECAUSE I HAD NO INTENTION-OF BEING RE-WIRED, AND HE REFUSED AT FIRST. HE WANTED ME TO RECONSIDER--AND-HE WASN'T EVEN THE ONE WHO'D PUT THEM IN------------------------------------------------------------! AGE 25: 450-500 LBS (APPROXIMATELY-)I COULDN'T WEIGH MYSELF, BUT THIS IS A FAIR ESTIMATION.------------------------------------------------------------ AGE 26: 425 LBS ON THE MORNING-OF MY GASTROPLASTY SURGERY.------------------------------------------------------------ AGE 27: 321 LBS, AND I AM NOW-ANOREXIC AND BULIMIC. YES, REALLY! I KNOW, BECAUSE I WATCHED ALL THE TALK-SHOWS AND READ THE BOOKS. THE SYMPTOMS SAID THAT SOMEONE SUFFERING FROM-THESE EATING DISORDERS IS OFTEN EMACIATED, (BUT NOT ALWAYS) THE REAL KEY-WAS, AND IS--- BEHAVIORS----! I'M NOT TALKING HERE ABOUT "BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION-,"OR DISCIPLINE. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SELF-DESTRUCTIVE, SELF-LOATHING BEHAVIORS-THAT DESTROY OUR BODIES AND OUR SOULS. SELF-ESTEEM IS THE PENICILLIN THAT-KEEPS THESE DESTRUCTIVE OBSESSIONS WITH DIETING AND AIRBRUSHED PHYSICAL-PERFECTION AT BAY.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AGE-----44: 420 OR SO (GIVE OR TAKE A FEW POUNDS,) BUT---------------------------------------------------------------- DOES IT REALLY MATTER?---------------------------------------------------------------- THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, COMMENTS?-LET ME KNOW------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
