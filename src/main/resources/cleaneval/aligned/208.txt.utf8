---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TEN YEARS ON-------------------------------------------------  THE DEFENDANT AS A DEAF MUTE-----------------------------------------------------  BY MOE AYE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE DEFENDANT AS A DEAF MUTE----------------------------------------  IT WAS EARLY MORNING, AROUND 6.30 AM, ON 14 JUNE 1991, WHEN A WARDEN---------------- SHOUTED TO ALL THE PRISONERS------ "KEEP YOUR CELL CLEAN AND PUT---------------- YOUR PRISON DRESS ON NEAT AND TIDY. SIT IN THE PRISON AND KEEP SILENT.---------------------" WE ALL UNDERSTOOD THAT A VIP WOULD VISIT THE PRISON.-------------------  ALTHOUGH WE SAT IN OUR CELLS FOR NEARLY FOUR HOURS, NO ONE ARRIVED---------------- AT THE PRISON AND WE WERE ALL VERY HUNGRY. WE TRIED TO ASK A WARDER---------------- WHEN THE VIP WOULD ARRIVE, BUT HE KNEW NOTHING AND SAID,----- "I'M---------------- ALSO VERY HUNGRY.------------------------"  IT WAS NEARLY 12.00 WHEN WE HEARD A NOISY WHISTLE AND THE SOUND---------------- OF WARDERS AT THE MAIN GATE. MANY WARDERS RAN THERE SHOUTING TO---------------- US,----- "SIT IN PRISON POSITION AND SHUT YOUR MOUTHS.-----" WE---------------- KNEW THAT THE VIP HAD ARRIVED AT THE MAIN GATE. FIFTEEN MINUTES---------------- LATER THE VIP, ESCORTED BY MANY PRISON OFFICERS AND WARDERS, PASSED---------------- THROUGH OUR CELLBLOCK. TEN MINUTES LATER, A NUMBER OF WARDERS SHOUTED---------------- TO US THAT WE COULD SIT EASY THIS MEANT THE VIP HAD LEFT THE PRISON. ----------------WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY HE HAD VISITED. WE KNEW ONLY THAT WE HAD HAD---------------- TO SIT IN THE PRISON POSITION FOR LONG HOURS AND FELT HAPPY BECAUSE---------------- WE WOULD HAVE BREAKFAST.-------------------  WHILE WE WERE-LYING ON OUR MATS WAITING FOR BREAKFAST A WARDER-----------------ASKED WHO MOE AYE WAS. HE ORDERED ME TO GET OUT OF THE CELL. MY---------------- CELLMATES LOOKED AT ME AND I GAVE THEM A SMILE. WE UNDERSTOOD THAT---------------- IF SOMEONE WAS TAKEN OUT OF HIS CELL AT-NOON OR NIGHT, IT MEANT---------------- A TRIAL OR RE-INTERROGATION. AS SOON AS-I STEPPED OUT A WHITE HOOD---------------- WAS PULLED OVER MY HEAD. THEN I HAD TO FOLLOW HIM LIKE A BLIND MAN.---------------------WHEN I ARRIVED IN THE-MAIN GATE, SOMEONE ASKED ABOUT MY BACKGROUND---------------- FOR-A FEW MINUTES. THEN I WAS HANDCUFFED-AND FORCED AND GET INTO---------------- A CAR. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF CAR AND WHO WAS IN THERE WITH---------------- ME. AFTER DRIVING FOR NEARLY FIVE MINUTES THE CAR STOPPED AND REALIZED---------------- THAT I WOULD BE SENT TO THE MILITARY COURT, AS IT WAS LOCATED IN---------------- FRONT OF THE CENTRAL PRISON, INSIDE THE SAME COMPOUND AS THE CENTRAL---------------- PRISON AND MY PRISON.-INSEIN SPECIAL JAIL.-THE HOOD WAS REMOVED---------------- FROM MY HEAD AND I COULD SEE IT WAS AS I HAD THOUGHT - I WAS IN---------------- FRONT OF THE NOTORIOUS MILITARY COURT. ONE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE---------------- OFFICER IN PLAIN CLOTHES ORDERED ME TO GET OUT OF THE CAR. TWO POLICEMEN---------------- LEAD ME TO A-SMALL ROOM COVERED WITH WIRE MESH. I SAW THAT THERE---------------- WERE THREE OTHER SMALL ROOMS AND-A BIG HALL NEARBY. I-COULD SEE---------------- THE OLD, DIRTY WALL OF INSEIN CENTRAL PRISON FROM MY ROOM.-------------------  AT THIS STAGE I HAD BEEN IN PRISON FOR SIX MONTHS, AFTER TWO MONTHS---------------- AT THE MIS INTERROGATION CENTRE. IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL FOR PRISONERS---------------- TO WAIT THIS LONG BEFORE THEY WERE TRIED. SOME HAD TO WAIT FOR YEARS----------------, SUCH AS MIN KO NAING, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ABFSU, WHO WAS ARRESTED---------------- IN 1989 IN BUT NOT TRIED UNTIL------ DURING MY SIX MONTHS IN PRISON---------------- BEFORE THE TRIAL, I WAS NEVER EVEN SURE WHAT I HAD BEEN CHARGED---------------- WITH. ABOVE THE CELL DOORS IN FORMATION ABOUT EACH PRISONER WAS---------------- POSTED BY THE AUTHORITIES, STATING THE PRISONER'S NAME, NUMBER AND---------------- THE SECTION OF THE ACT THAT THE PRISONER WAS CHARGED UNDER. HOWEVER---------------- THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHARGES WAS CONSTANTLY CHANGED FOR THE---------------- POLITICAL PRISONERS. SOMETIMES I WOULD LEAVE TO TAKE MY SHOWER BELIEVING---------------- THAT I WAS BEING CHARGED UNDER SECTION 5(J) OF THE EMERGENCY PROVISION---------------- ACT, BUT WHEN I RETURNED THIS HAD BEEN CHANGED TO ANOTHER ACT. AT---------------- TIMES THESE CHANGES HAPPENED ON A DAILY BASIS. FOR SOME PRISONER---------------- EVER THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS CHANGED COMPLETELY, SO THAT ONE---------------- DAY THEY WOULD BELIEVE THEY WERE CHARGED WITH STEALING AND THE NEXT---------------- DAY THIS HAD CHANGED TO ANOTHER CHARGE, SUCH AS USING DRUGS OR EVEN---------------- JUST BEING HOMELESS.-------------------  I BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD TWO OBJECTIVES IN MIND BY DOING---------------- THIS FIRSTLY IT WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL TACTIC TO MAKE THE PRISONERS---------------- CONFUSED. SECONDLY IT WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE THE WARDERS LOSE RESPECT---------------- FOR THE POLITICAL PRISONERS, BY-SUGGESTING THEY HAD COMMITTED CRIMINAL---------------- ACTS. IN BURMESE CULTURE IT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE FOR THE WARDERS---------------- TO THEN TREAT THE WARDERS WITH MUCH LESS RESPECT.-------------------  A FEW MINUTES AFTER I HAD BEEN TAKEN TO THE ROOM A PLAIN-CLOTHES---------------- MIS OFFICER, A POLICE OFFICER AND TWO ARMED SOLDERS ENTERED THE---------------- ROOM AND ASKED ME ABOUT MY BACKGROUND FOR A WHILE. THE MIS OFFICER---------------- SAID.----- "YOUR WILL BE SENT TO THE MILITARY COURT SOON. PLEASE---------------- KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN OR MAKE ANY REPLY---------------- TO THE MILITARY COURT. IF YOU DO, YOUR PRISON SENTENCE WILL BE DOUBLED.---------------- NOW OUR COMMANDER, FROM MIS UNIT 7, HAS ALREADY DECIDED TO GIVE---------------- YOU FIVE YEARS IMPRISONMENT, BUT IF YOU COMPLAIN OR REPLY WITH ANGRY---------------- WORDS TO THE COURT, YOU WILL BE SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS IMPRISONMENT.------------------------"  THE POLICE OFFICER ALSO SAID.----- "YOU SHOULD KEEP QUIET IN THE---------------- COURT FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FUTURE.-----" THEN THEY LEAD ME TO THE---------------- COURT. AFTER WALKING FOR TWO MINUTES, WE ARRIVED AT A LARGE ROOM---------------- AND I SAW THAT THERE WERE SEVEN SOLDIERS AND FIVE POLICEMEN, ALL---------------- ARMED, STANDING NEAR THE DOORS IN THE HALL. I WAS SURPRISED THAT---------------- THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE PRESENT JUST FOR MY TRIAL. THERE WAS A---------------- LOW STAGE AT THE TOP OF THE HALL, ABOVE WHICH HUNG THE BURMESE FLAG----------------, AND ON EITHER SIDE OF IT LARGE PHOTOGRAPHS OF GENERAL AUNG SAN AND---------------- THE DICTATOR NE WIN. THERE WERE MANY CHAIRS, NEARLY 30 OR 40, ON---------------- WHICH SOME MEN IN PLAIN CLOTHES WERE SITTING. THERE WERE MANY CEILING---------------- FANS AND THE HALL WAS SILENT EXCEPT FOR THE NOISE OF THE FANS.-------------------  THEN I WAS FORCED TO SIT ON THE CHAIR NEAREST THE STAGE. A POLICE---------------- OFFICER REQUESTED ME TO STAND TO PAY RESPECT WHILE THE MEMBERS OF---------------- THE MILITARY COURT WERE ON THE STAGE. TEN MINUTES LATER, THREE HIGH-RANKING---------------- MILITARY OFFICERS EMERGED FROM A SMALL ROOM NEAR THE STAGE AND STEPPED---------------- ONTO THE STAGE. AT THAT TIME A POLICE OFFICER SHOUTED FOR ALL TO---------------- STAND AND PAY RESPECT. AFTER THEY TIME A POLICE OFFICER SHOUTED---------------- FOR ALL TO BE SEATED. HE WALKED NEAR THE STAGE AND PASSED SOME PAPERS---------------- TO ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE-COURT. I KNEW THAT THE COURT WAS MADE---------------- UP OF THREE MILITARY OFFICERS - AN ARMY FULL-COLONEL, A NAVY LIEUTENANT---------------- COLONEL AND AN AIR FORCE LIEUTENANT COLONEL. THE OFFICER FORM THE---------------- ARMY WAS PRESIDING, AND READ ALOUD,----- "THIS IS MILITARY COURT---------------- NUMBER THREE AND IT WILL HEAR THE TRIAL OF MOE AYE. THE COURT WILL---------------- BE IN SESSION TWICE-TO HEAR THE CASE AND TO GIVE JUDGMENT.---------------------" THEN HE LOOKED AT THE POLICE OFFICER AND GAVE A NOD.-------------------  THE POLICE OFFICER STOOD AND LOUDLY READ MY CASE. I WAS ACCUSED---------------- OF MANY-THINGS, NOTABLY TRYING TO ASSASSINATE THE MILITARY LEADER---------------- OF THE SLORC, TRYING TO KIDNAP THE FAMILIES OF HIGH-RANKING MILITARY---------------- OFFICERS, TRYING TO SMUGGLE IN ARMS FROM THE BORDERS AND TRYING ----------------TO PERSUADE YOUNG STUDENTS TO GO TO THE JUNGLE. I WAS ALSO SAID---------------- TO HAVE CONTACTED MANY GROUPS, MOST, OF WHICH I HAD NEVER HEARD---------------- OF AND DIDN'T THINK EVEN EXISTED. THE POLICE OFFICER CONCLUDED BY---------------- READING--------THEREFORE I WOULD LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE---------------- MILITARY COURT TO GIVE MOE AYE A HEAVY PUNISHMENT FOR HIS ANTI-GOVERNMENT---------------- ACTIVITIES.-----" I REMEMBER THINKING THAT THE CRIMES I WAS ACCUSED---------------- OF SOUNDED SERIOUS ENOUGH TO DESERVE THE DEATH PENALTY. AFTER HEARING---------------- FROM THE POLICE OFFICER, THE PRESIDING OFFICER OF THE MILITARY COURT---------------- SAID THAT THEY WOULD THINK AND DECIDE ON MY PUNISHMENT SOON. NOBODY---------------- ASKED ME WHETHER ANY OF THE CHARGES WERE TRUE, OR IF I HAD ANYTHING---------------- TO SAY. NO WITNESSES WERE CALLED AND NO EVIDENCE WAS PRESENTED.---------------- THE COURT MEMBERS RETURNED TO THE ROOM THEY HAD COME FROM.---------------------------------------  I LOOKED AROUND THE HALL. SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN WERE STANDING ALERTLY---------------- AND SOME POLICE OFFICERS LOOKED AT THE CEILING. SOME MIS OFFICERS---------------- SITTING BEHIND ME LOOKED OUTSIDE. ONE ARMY OFFICER WAS WALKING NEAR---------------- THE ENTRANCE. THEN I LOOKED AT GENERAL AUNG SAN AND THOUGHT ABOUT---------------- HIM. I WONDERED WHAT HE WOULD SAY IF HE KNEW ABOUT THIS TRIAL. A---------------- FEW MINUTES-LATER I SAW A MIS OFFICER IN PLAIN CLOTHES ENTERING-----------------THE ROOM WHERE THE MILITARY COURT MEMBERS HAD GONE. FIVE MINUTES---------------- LATER HE CAME OUT AGAIN AND CAME OVER TO SIT BEHIND ME. I REALIZED---------------- THEN THAT HE WAS CAPTAIN KYAW ZIN THET WHO HAD ARRESTED ME IN NOVEMBER---------------------- I UNDERSTOOD AT THIS POINT THAT THE MILITARY COURT HAD ADJOURNED---------------- TO WAIT FOR HIM, AS HE-WAS THE MIS OFFICER IN CHARGE OF MY CASE.---------------- EVERY ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY IS CONTROLLED BY THE MIS,-INCLUDING-----------------THE COURTS. EVEN THOUGH KYAW ZIN THET WAS JUST A CAPTAIN, IT WAS---------------- HIS ROLE TO DIRECT THE TRIBUNAL MEMBERS, CONSISTING OF A FULL COLONEL---------------- AND TWO LIEUTENANT COLONELS, WHAT TO CONVICT ME OF AND HOW MANY---------------- YEARS TO SENTENCE ME TO. NO DOUBT THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD JUST DONE.---------------- WHILE I WAS TRYING TO LOOK BACK AT HIM, A POLICE OFFICER SHOUTED---------------- FOR ALL TO STAND TO PAY RESPECT TO THE COURT. THE MILITARY COURT---------------- MEMBERS TOOK THEIR SEATS AGAIN.-------------------  THE ARMY OFFICER SAID SLOWLY,----- "AFTER HEARING THESE ACCUSATIONS----------------, THE MILITARY COURT BELIEVES THAT MOE AYE HAS VIOLATED THE LAWS AND---------------- IT IS CLEAR THAT HE TRIED TO PROMOTE THE ANTI-GOVERNMENT MOVEMENT.---------------- AFTER THE 1988 ANARCHY, THE MILITA4RY HAD TO STEP IN AND WAS ONLY---------------- JUST ABLE TO SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM FALLING INTO AN ABYSS. MOE AYE---------------- NEVER THOUGHT WELL OF THE MILITARY AND HAD A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS---------------- IT. HE TRIED TO INCITE THE PEOPLE BY CLAIMING THAT THE MILITARY---------------- WILL NEVER TRANSFER POWER. HE IS TRYING TO DESTROY THE INTEGRITY---------------- OF THE MILITARY AND BRING ABOUT FURTHER ANARCHY LIKE THAT IN---------------------- THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO THE EMERGENCY PROVISION ACT, SECTION 5-J----------------), THE MILITARY COURT SENTENCES HIM TO SEVEN-YEARS IMPRISONMENT WITH---------------- HARD LABOUR,-----" THE COURT MEMBERS STOOD AND WALKED BECK INTO---------------- THE ROOM.-------------------  I WAS REALLY SURPRISED ABOUT THE TRIAL, IN WHICH I HAD NOT BEEN---------------- ASKED ANYTHING. I HAD THOUGHT THEY WOULD AT LEAST ASK ME WHETHER---------------- I WAS GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY. WHEN I TRIED TO LOOK AT KYAW ZIN THET----------------, HE WENT OUT OF THE HALL. TWO POLICE OFFICERS CAME OVER TO ME AND---------------- SAID,----- "THANKS FOR YOUR PEACEFUL COOPERATION, ALLOWING US TO---------------- FINISH THE TRIAL.-----" I WAS SURPRISED AGAIN AND DIDN'T REPLY.-------------------  FINALLY I WAS SENT BACK TO INSEIN SPECIAL JAIL GATE IN THE CAR.---------------- IN THE CAR AS USUAL THE HOOD WAS PULLED OVER MY HANDCUFFS, WHICH---------------- I HAD WORN THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL, REMOVED. WHEN I ARRIVED BACK IN---------------- MY CELL MY CELLMATES JOKINGLY ASKED ME HOW MANY YEARS I HAD CONTRACTED---------------- WITH THE JUNTA TO HIRE MY ROOM FOR. I REPLIED----- "IT'S A SEVEN---------------- YEAR CONTRACT.-----" I STILL REMEMBER THAT I HAD TO HAVE-MY BREAKFAST---------------- WHILE MY CELLMATES HAD THEIR DINNER-ON THAT DAY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ABOUT THE AUTHOR----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  M-------OE AYE WAS BORN IN MANDALAY IN---------------- 1964 AND WAS A STUDENT AT THE RANGOON INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT---------------- THE 1988 PRO-DEMOCRACY UPRISING.
