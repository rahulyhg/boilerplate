WHEN ONE THINKS-OF HOYAS ONE USUALLY THINKS OF THE OLD FAVOURITE,--- HOYA CARNOSA,---- WHICH IS-BETTER KNOWN AS "GRANDMA'S OLD FASHIONED WAX PLANT", AND LETS IT GO-AT THAT-,ASSUMING THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO IT. WHEN CURIOSITY GETS THE BETTER OF A-NOVICE GROWER, TO THE POINT THAT HE OR SHE ORDERS AN ADVERTISED CATALOGUE-,JUST TO LEARN-WHY ANYONE WOULD HAVE THE NERVE TO ADVERTISE A CATALOGUE WITH-ONLY ONE PLANT IN IT, SHOCK OFTEN RESULTS FROM LEARNING THAT HOYA IS A-GENUS COMPRISED OF AROUND 200 DIFFERENT SPECIES, PLUS NUMEROUS CULTIVARS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE HISTORY OF HOYA---------------------- HOYA WAS ONCE PART OF THE APOCINACEAE FAMILY OF PLANTS. ROBERT BROWN-CREATED ASCLEPIADACEAE IN 1810 TO ACCOMMODATE A GROUP OF APOCINACEAE PLANTS-WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS DID NOT FIT WELL INTO THAT FAMILY. HE NAMED THE NEW-FAMILY ASCLEPIADACEAE AND INCLUDED IN IT ALL THOSE FORMER APOCINACEAE PLANTS-HAVING THEIR POLLEN CONTAINED IN GELATINOUS MASSES CALLED POLLINIA-(SINGULAR IS POLLINIUM). THE ONLY OTHER GROUP OF PLANTS WITH POLLINIA ARE-THE ORCHIDS. ASCLEPIADACEAE INCLUDES THE COMMON ROADSIDE MILKWEEDS-(ASCLEPIAS), THE POPULAR SUCCULENT STAPELIADS, WHICH LOOK MORE LIKE CACTI-THAN ASCLEPIADS AND THE VERY INTERESTING DISCHIDIAS, WHOSE LEAVES ARE OFTEN-SHAPED LIKE POUCHES AND URNS AND SERVE AS HOMES FOR ANTS. HOYA CONTAINS THE-MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS IN THE FAMILY.-------- ROBERT BROWN WAS BORN IN SCOTLAND ON DECEMBER 21,------ HE STUDIED MEDICINE-IN EDINBURGH BUT DID NOT TAKE A MEDICAL DEGREE, PREFERRING INSTEAD TO-STUDY THE PLANTS THAT, AT THAT TIME, ALL MEDICAL SPECIALISTS DEPENDED UPON-AS CURES. DESPITE HIS LIFELONG DEDICATION TO THE STUDY OF PLANTS, HE IS-BEST KNOWN TODAY IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY FOR THE DISCOVERY OF-"BROWNIAN MOVEMENT," WHICH, SIMPLIFIED, IS "THE MOTION THAT YOU SEE IN A LIQUID-CONTAINING MINUTE SUSPENDED SOLID PARTICLES.--------" IT IS ONLY BY CHANCE THAT HOYAS ARE KNOWN TODAY BY THE NAME HOYA. THERE IS-STILL SOME CONTROVERSY OVER WHICH NAME, HOYA R.BR. OR SPERLINGIA VAHL CAME-FIRST. BOTH-NAMES RECEIVED THEIR-FIRST PUBLICATION IN 1810 AT ABOUT THE-SAME TIME. SOME SAY THAT BROWN'S PUBLICATION PRECEDED VAHL'S BY SEVERAL-DAYS AND OTHERS ARGUE THE OTHER-WAY. THE SIDES ARE SO DIVIDED THAT THERE IS-A MOVEMENT AFOOT TO INSTIGATE FORMAL EFFORTS TO HAVE THE NAME HOYA-CONSERVED SINCE IT IS THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN NAME. IF VAHL'S MANUSCRIPT HAD-BEEN PUBLISHED WHEN IT WAS FIRST SUBMITTED THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HOYAS-WOULD BE KNOWN AS SPERLINGIAS TODAY. SPERLINGIA LOST OUT DUE TO ITS-AUTHOR'S HAVING BEEN HANGED FOR TREASON. HIS MANUSCRIPT WAS NOT PUBLISHED-UNTIL LONG AFTER HIS DEATH, IT IS SAID, BECAUSE NO PUBLISHER WAS WILLING TO-HAVE HIS NAME ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF A TRAITOR.-------- ROBERT BROWN NAMED HOYA IN HONOUR OF HIS FRIEND AND FELLOW BOTANIST, THOMAS-HOY, WHO WAS EMPLOYED AS HEAD GARDENER BY-THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND AT HIS ESTATE-,SION HOUSE. THERE IS NO RECORD OF THOMAS HOY'S EVER HAVING GROWN A HOYA BUT SURELY- HE MUST HAVE, SINCE HIS EMPLOYER WAS AN AVID COLLECTOR OF RARE TROPICAL PLANTS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE NATURE OF HOYAS--------------------- WE USUALLY THINK OF HOYA AS SUCCULENT AND THERE ARE, INDEED, A LOT OF-SUCCULENT HOYAS, PLUS MANY MORE THAT HAVE SUCCULENT PARTS, BUT THE VAST-MAJORITY OF THEM ARE NON-SUCCULENT. WE ALSO USUALLY THINK OF HOYAS AS VINES-BUT THERE ARE MANY SPECIES WITH LITTLE TO NO VINING TENDENCIES. FOR-PLANT COLLECTORS, THERE ARE HOYAS FOR EVERY TASTE AND SITUATION. SOME ARE-TWINING VINES; SOME ARE WOODY SHRUBS; SOME ARE ENTIRELY TERRESTRIAL; AND-SOME ARE EPIPHYTES. THERE ARE STILL OTHERS THAT BEGIN LIFE AS TERRESTRIALS-THEN LOSE ALL CONTACT WITH THE GROUND AND CONTINUE LIFE AS EPIPHYTES. MANY-CLING TO THEIR SUPPORTS BOTH BY TWINING AND BY ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS, BUT-OTHERS GROW AS UPRIGHT SHRUBS. THERE ARE A FEW THAT BEGIN AS UPRIGHT SHRUBS-BUT AFTER BECOMING SEVERAL FEET TALL, CONTINUE THEIR LIFE AS TWINING VINES.-SOME HOYAS ARE WOODY; OTHERS ARE-SOFT AND SUCCULENT. SOME HAVE WOODY STALKS-AND SUCCULENT LEAVES. OTHERS ARE THIN AND WIRY WITH PAPERY LEAVES.-------- HOYA LEAVES VARY IN SIZE, TEXTURE, COLOUR AND VENATION. IN SIZE THEY RANGE-FROM A CENTIMETRE IN LENGTH AND FROM TWO TO FOUR MILLIMETRES IN WIDTH (---HOYA-ENGLERIANA,---- HOSSEUS) TO 25 CM. BY 25 CM. (---HOYA LATIFOLIA,---- G. DON).--- HOYA-CORIACEA,---- BLUME, IS SAID TO SOMETIMES HAVE LEAVES AS LONG AS TWO FEET IN-LENGTH. ONE OF THE MOST SUCCULENT OF THE LOT,--- HOYA KERRII,---- CRAIB, HAS-PERFECT VALENTINE SHAPED LEAVES, WITH THE NOTCHES AT THE APEXES OF THE-LEAVES INSTEAD OF AT THE BASES. THIS SPECIES HAS TWO FORMS, ONE WITH-GLABROUS LEAVES AND ONE WITH SUEDE TEXTURED LEAVES. THERE ARE HOYAS WITH-ALMOST PERFECTLY ROUND LEAVES AND OTHERS WITH LINEAR LEAVES (---HOYA LINEARIS-----,WALL. EX. D. DON AND--- HOYA TERETIFOLIA,---- GRIFF. EX HOOK. F.). A POPULAR-SPECIES,--- HOYA SHEPHERDII,---- SHORT EX HOOK. HAS LEAVES THAT LOOK FOR THE WORLD-LIKE BUNCHES OF STRING BEANS HANGING FROM THEIR STALKS.--- HOYA LINEARIS-----,WALL. EX D. DON IS COVERED WITH FINE DOWNY HAIR AND GREATLY RESEMBLES-MASSES OF SPANISH MOSS (---TILLANDSIA USENEOIDES----) HANGING FROM TREES IN ITS-NATIVE HABITAT. SOME HOYA LEAVES ARE SMOOTH AND SHINY; SOME ARE COVERED-WITH HAIRS. SOME HOYA LEAVES APPEAR TO BE VEINLESS WHILE OTHERS HAVE VERY-CONSPICUOUS VEINS OF A LIGHTER OR DARKER COLOUR THAN THE REST OF THE LEAVES.-SOME HAVE LEAVES THAT ARE MOTTLED WITH SPECKLES OF SILVERY WHITE (---HOYA-CARNOSA,---- R. BR.). SOME HOYA LEAVES ARE SMOOTH AND SHINY AND OTHERS ARE-COVERED WITH HAIRS. SOME HOYAS HAVE LEAVES THAT ARE THIN AND TRANSLUCENT(----HOYA CORIACEA,---- BLUME); SOME ARE SO THICK AND SUCCULENT THAT THEY LOOK MORE-LIKE CRASSULAS THAN HOYAS (---HOYA AUSTRALIS SUBSP. RUPICOLA, ORAMICOLA---- AND----SANIAE---- FROM AUSTRAILIA AND--- HOYA PACHYCLADA---- FROM THAILAND).-------- HOYA FLOWERS ARE JUST AS VARIED AS THE LEAVES, DESPITE THE FACT THAT ALL ARE-SHAPED LIKE FIVE POINTED STARS. THEY GROW IN UMBELS, USUALLY WITH MANY-FLOWERS PER UMBEL. INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS RANGE IN SIZE FROM AS SMALL AS FOUR-TO FIVE MILLIMETRES IN DIAMETER (---HOYA BILOBATA,---- SCHLTR.) TO WELL OVER-THREE INCHES IN DIAMETER (---HOYA IMPERIALIS,---- LINDL. AND--- H. MACGILLIVRAYI,---- F.-M. BAILEY). THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS PER UMBEL VARIES FROM ONE (---H. PAUCIFLORA-----,WIGHT.) TO 55 OR EVEN MORE.--- HOYA CORIACEA,---- BLUME HAS BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE- AS MANY AS 70, EACH MEASURING NEARLY 2 CENTIMETRES IN DIAMETER. THE SINGLE-FLOWERED--- HOYA PAUCIFLORA,---- WIGHT MAKES UP FOR ITS PAUCITY BY ITS FLOWER-SIZE OF NEARLY AN INCH AND A HALF IN DIAMETER.-------- JUST AS HOYAS VARY IN SIZE, THEY ALSO VARY IN TEXTURE, SOME BEING GLABROUS-AND SHINY AND SOME BEING QUITE HAIRY. THEY ALSO VARY IN COLOUR. THEY COME-IN THE PUREST WHITE, VARYING SHADES OF PINK FROM ALMOST WHITE TO RUBBER-DOLL-OR BUBBLE-GUM PINK, YELLOWISH-PINK, YELLOW, GREEN, PURPLE, BROWNISH-RED AND-BROWN. THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE SO DARK THAT THEY ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS-BLACK. UNTIL RECENTLY IT WAS THOUGHT THAT A TRUE RED HOYA WAS NOT EVER-LIKELY TO APPEAR BUT RECENT DISCOVERIES MAKE THAT SEEM POSSIBLE. ONE OF THE-TWO CLONES OF--- HOYA MINDORENSIS,---- SCHLTR., FROM THE PHILIPPINES, WHICH ARE-CURRENTLY IN CIRCULATION, COMES VERY CLOSE TO BEING A TRUE RED. BLUE STILL-DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE REPRESENTED IN THE HOYA GENUS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ HOYA CULTURE--------------------- HOYAS ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, VERY EASY TO GROW. THEY REQUIRE A WELL-DRAINED SOIL, WARMTH AND LOTS OF HUMIDITY. MANY PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT-THE TEMPERATURE MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO FALL BELOW 60 DEGREES F. OR GO OVER-85 DEGREES F. I HAVE SEEN NO HARM RESULTING FROM NIGHT TEMPERATURES OF- 45DEGREES F. IN WINTER OR 120 DEGREES F. IN DAYTIME TEMPERATURE IN SUMMER.-HERE IN NORTH CENTRAL GEORGIA, SEVERAL OF US HAVE HAD--- HOYA SHEPHERDII,---- SHORT-EX HOOK. SURVIVE-OUTDOORS ALL WINTER,-WHEN WE FORGOT TO BRING IT INSIDE.-ALL OF US REPORTED THAT OUR PLANTS WERE LEFT IN WELL SHELTERED AREAS BUT-,EVEN SO, WE OFTEN HAVE-WINTER TEMPERATURES BELOW 20 DEGREES F.--- HOYA-SHEPHERDII---- IS NATIVE TO THE LOWER HIMALAYAS, WHERE FREEZING DOES OCCUR SO-THAT-EXPLAINS ITS HARDINESS. AS FOR TEMPERATURES-AT THE OTHER END OF THE-THERMOMETER, WE MUST REMEMBER THAT MOST HOYAS ARE NATIVE TO THE VERY HOTTEST-SPOTS ON EARTH. THE SECRET TO SURVIVAL UNDER LESS THAN IDEAL CONDITIONS-APPEARS TO BE PROVIDING LOTS OF HUMIDITY - VERY NEAR, BUT NOT QUITE, 100%.-WHEN IT IS COOL, WATER SHOULD ONLY BE APPLIED IN AMOUNTS TO PREVENT LEAVES-FROM SHRIVELLING. ONE ATLANTA GROWER LOST MOST OF HIS HOYAS LAST WINTER-BECAUSE THE ROOTS GOT TOO DRY. MY HOYA ROOTS WERE GIVEN EVEN LESS WATER THAN-HIS AND MINE THRIVED. WE COMPARED NOTES AND CONCLUDED THAT THE ONLY-DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR GROWING CONDITIONS WAS THAT THE HUMIDITY IN MY-GREENHOUSE WAS NEAR THE SATURATION LEVEL. HUMIDITY PROVIDES SUMMER-PROTECTION TOO. I HAVE SEEN HOYA LEAVES BURN NEARLY TO A CRISP IN SUMMER-,EVEN WITH EXHAUST FANS RUNNING FULL TIME AND DAILY WATERING - AND WITH A-50% SHADE CLOTH COVERING THE ROOF. I DO NOT USE EXHAUST FANS IN MY-GREENHOUSE BECAUSE I FIND THAT MEALIE BUGS ARE SUCKED IN WITH THE BREEZE. I-HAVE LOTS OF CIRCULATING FANS INSIDE AND MAINTAIN HUMIDITY NEAR THE-SATURATION POINT. THERE'S RARELY A BURNED LEAF. ALTHOUGH MANY HOYAS-WILL-GROW WELL AND MAKE LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL LEAVES IN-A CENTRALLY HEATED-AIR-CONDITIONED LIVING ROOM, IT IS VERY RARE THAT ONE WILL BLOOM IN ONE. IF A-LIVING ROOM IS THE ONLY-INDOOR PLACE YOU HAVE FOR GROWING HOYAS, IF YOU WANT-THEM TO BLOOM, FIND A PLACE OUTDOORS IN SUMMER - UNDER A TREE OR, BETTER-YET, ON A SCREENED PORCH - ANYWHERE THAT PROTECTS THEM FROM NOONDAY SUN.---------- MANY HOYAS RESPOND TO A BIT OF LIME IN THE POTTING MIX BUT MOST OF THEM DO- BETTER IN A VERY SLIGHTLY ACID COMPOST. SOME, BEING COASTAL DWELLERS CAN EVEN-TAKE A BIT OF SALT SPRAY SO IF YOU LIVE NEAR THE OCEAN IN A WARN CLIMATE-,YOU SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE FINDING A HOYA SUITABLE TO YOUR CONDITIONS. ONE,----HOYA HALOPHILA,---- SCHLTR., WHOSE NAME MEANS "SALT LOVER," WAS ORIGINALLY-DISCOVERED GROWING ON THE BEACHES OF NEW GUINEA AND NEARBY SMALLER ISLANDS.-THERE ARE MANY OTHER COASTAL HOYAS AND MANY THAT ARE FOUND GROWING-,SUSPENDED ABOVE BAYOU WATERS FROM THE BRANCHES OF MANGROVE TREES. THERE ARE-ALSO A LARGE NUMBER THAT ARE NATIVE TO MOUNTAINOUS AREAS, SOME IN CALCAREOUS-SOILS AND SOME IN SOILS CONTAINING GRANITE AND SHALE. OTHERS LIVE-SYMBIOTICALLY WITH ANTS. IN SOME SPECIES, SUCH AS--- HOYA IMBRICATA,---- CALLERY-EX DECNE., ONE OF THE LEAVES AT EACH NODE (WHICH ARE PAIRED IN MOST HOYA-SPECIES) ABORTS AND THE SINGLE PELTATE LEAF THAT REMAINS, FLATTENS ITSELF-AGAINST THE TRUNK OF ITS HOST TREE AND CLINGS THERE, BEING HELD BY NUMEROUS-NODAL ROOTS. ANTS BUILD THEIR NESTS BENEATH THE LEAVES AND CONTRIBUTE TO-THE PLANT'S NOURISHMENT. ANOTHER SPECIES (---HOYA DARWINII,---- LOHER) PROVIDES A-HOME FOR ANTS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. FOR MUCH OF ITS LIFE, ITS LEAVES LOOK-LIKE NORMAL LEAVES, BUT SOMETHING WILL TRIGGER THE GROWTH MECHANISM AND-CAUSE THE LATERAL MARGINS OF SOME OF ITS LEAVES TO STOP GROWING, WHILE THE-CENTRES CONTINUE TO GROW. THE RESULT IS LEAVES THAT ARE ROLLED UP INTO-BALL SHAPES, LOOKING MUCH LIKE GREEN GOLF BALLS. IT ISN'T KNOWN WHAT CAUSES-THIS BUT IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT IT IS CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF FORMIC-ACID, A BY-PRODUCT OF ANTS. THE SHELTERED GOLF-BALL LEAVES SERVE AS HOMES-FOR ANTS, WHOSE WASTES FERTILISE THE HOST PLANT AND THE UNSHELTERED LEAVES-COLLECT RAIN WATER WHICH IS UTILISED BY THE HOST PLANTS DURING DRY PERIODS.-ANOTHER ANT LOVER-IS THE POPULAR MINIATURE,--- HOYA LACUNOSA,---- BLUME.- ALTHOUGH USUALLY GROWN AS A PENDULOUS HANGING BASKET PLANT IN CULTIVATION-, IN ITS HABITAT IT IS A TREE CLIMBER. IT IS USUALLY FOUND GROWING OUT OF THE-GROUND FROM THE CENTER OF AN ANT BED. AS IT CLIMBS UP THE TRUNKS OF NEARBY-TREES, THE ANTS BUILD "DIRT-DAUBER-LIKE" TUNNELS ALONG ITS STALKS, IN ORDER-TO GIVE THEIR TUNNELS STABILITY. THE ANTS LIVE INSIDE THE TUNNELS AND-SUPPLY NOURISHMENT TO THE PLANTS. COLLECTORS, IN THE WILD, OFTEN FIND, TO-THEIR SORROW, THAT A PLANT WITH NOT A SINGLE ANT IN SIGHT WILL SUDDENLY COME-ALIVE WITH VICIOUS ANTS, WHEN THEY CUT A STEM AND TRY TO DISLODGE A CUTTING.-THE SPECIES OF ANTS THAT OCCUPY THOSE TUNNELS ARE SAID TO STING LIKE THE-DICKENS AND LEAVE PAINFUL, ITCHY SORES WITH DAYS WORTH OF SCRATCHING IN-THEIR WAKE. NOT TO FEAR, THIS LOVELY AND VERY FRAGRANT WEE HOYA WILL GROW-VERY NICELY WITHOUT ANTS SO DON'T FEAR GROWING IT.-------- THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECT OF GROWING HOYAS-IS FINDING CORRECTLY-LABELLED-ONES. MANY PEOPLE DON'T-CARE A BIT WHAT THEIR HOYAS ARE CALLED - OR EVEN-,IF THEY HAVE NAMES. THEY GROW BY GOD AND BY GUESS OR PURE ANIMAL INSTINCT-AND NEVER LOSE A PLANT. OTHERS LIKE TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR PLANTS' NATIVE-HABITATS AND TRY TO MATCH CLIMATIC AND SOIL CONDITIONS TO THOSE HABITATS.-THAT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE FOR HOYA GROWERS BECAUSE DEALERS CALL PLANTS BY-WHATEVER NAMES SUIT THEM. IT DOES ONE LITTLE GOOD TO KNOW THAT--- HOYA-GRIFFITHII,---- HOOK.F., FOR EXAMPLE, IS A NATIVE TO NORTHERN INDIA, SIKKIM AND-NEPAL, IF THE PLANT ONE BUYS WITH THAT LABEL ACTUALLY CAME FOR AN ISLAND IN-THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE SOLOMONS, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE THE ONE I GOT SO-LABELLED ORIGINATED. ONE GROWER (NO LONGER IN BUSINESS) ONCE LISTED OVER- 200DIFFERENT SPECIES NAMES. I BOUGHT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM AND LEARNED, TO-MY SORROW, THAT THE DEALER HAD ONLY 7 DIFFERENT CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED SPECIES-AND ONE OF THOSE WAS LABELED ONLY HALF RIGHT. ALL THE REST WERE EITHER-DUPLICATES OF THOSE SEVEN WITH DIFFERENT LABELS OR CULTIVARS OF THEM, PLUS A-NUMBER OF UNIDENTIFIED NUMBERED SPECIES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ HOYA PESTS--------------------- HOYAS ARE LIKED BY THREE COMMON GARDEN PESTS, APHIDS, MEALY BUGS, RED SPIDER-MITES AND SCALES. THESE ARE EASILY CONTROLLED BY SYSTEMIC INSECTICIDES-,UNLESS YOU ARE OPPOSED TO THEIR USE. MANY CONTROL THEM WITH PLAIN OLD-RUBBING ALCOHOL. MANY SPRAY IT ON THE PLANTS RIGHT FROM THE BOTTLE. OTHERS-DILUTE IT WITH WATER AND ADD SOAP OR STICKER SPREADERS TO IT. SOME SAY YOU-SHOULD WASH THE ALCOHOL OFF AFTER IT HAS DONE ITS JOB, BUT IT ISN'T-NECESSARY. IT DOES NO HARM AS LONG AS THE SUN DOESN'T HIT THE PLANTS WHILE THEY-ARE STILL WET - IT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN PLAIN WATER IN THAT RESPECT. SOME-USE INSECTICIDAL SOAPS. I HAVE FOUND THE USE OF ALCOHOL AND-INSECTICIDAL SOAPS TO BE WORTHLESS, EXCEPT THAT ALCOHOL APPLIED TO A SWAB-,USED TO WIPE THE INSECTS OFF DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB BUT THIS IS EXTREMELY-IMPRACTICAL IN A LARGE COLLECTION AND COULD BECOME A FULL TIME JOB. OTHERS-USE PREYING INSECTS. WE IN ATLANTA LEARNED THE HARD WAY A FEW YEARS AGO-THAT PREYING INSECTS,-WHICH ARE NOT NATIVE TO THE AREA CAN CREATE MORE-PROBLEMS THAN THEY SOLVE. ONCE THEY FEED ON THE MEALY BUGS, THEY START-LOOKING FOR OTHER FOOD AND THAT FOOD MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU'D LIKE THEM TO FEED-ON. ALSO WHEN REMOVED FROM THEIR NATURAL HOMES THEY MUST FIND OTHER NESTING-PLACES TO THEIR LIKING. TEN MILLION NON-NATIVE LADY BEETLES CRAWLING ALL-OVER ONE'S CEILINGS, FLOORS, FURNITURE AND INHABITING ONE'S BREAD BOX WILL-CURE ONE OF IMPORTING EXOTIC PREYING INSECTS VERY QUICKLY. IF ONE HAS ONLY-A FEW PLANTS, SWABBING WITH ALCOHOL IS THE IDEAL METHOD OF RIDDING ONES-PLANTS OF INSECT PESTS. IN A GREENHOUSE WITH SEVERAL THOUSAND PLANTS-,CHEMICAL CONTROL IS THE ONLY PRACTICAL SOLUTION. IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO HIRE-PROFESSIONAL HANDLERS TO APPLY THE CHEMICALS, I STRONGLY ADVISE IT. IF YOU-DO IT YOURSELF, BE SURE THAT YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THE CONTAINER-PRECISELY AND WEAR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. THE BEST METHOD OF PEST CONTROL IS-STILL TO AVOID THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. KEEPING ALL NEW PLANTS ISOLATED FOR-ABOUT SIX WEEKS BEFORE INTRODUCING THEM INTO YOUR PEST FREE COLLECTION IS-THE BEST ADVISE YOU WILL EVER FOLLOW.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
