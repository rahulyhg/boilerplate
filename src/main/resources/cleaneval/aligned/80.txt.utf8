CERTAINLY--- SUBJECTS DIFFER-DRASTICALLY IN THE-----RELATIVE STRENGTH OF-THEIR FOUNDATIONS, OR IN THE-APPARENT--- FUNDAMENTALITY OF THEIR---- CONCEPTS, METHODS, PRINCIPLES-,THEORIES, ACHIEVEMENTS, RESEARCH, LANGUAGE, LOGIC, ETC.------  IDEONOMY CAN COMPARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES TO-DISCOVER---- ANALOGIES, DIFFERENCES--COMMONALITIES, INTERDEPENDENCES, CONTRADICTIONS-,REDUNDANCIES, INTERPENETRATIONS, CONVERGENCES, COMMON GOALS AND NEEDS,-UNITIES, ETC.--- IT CAN USE THESE TO SUGGEST---- OMISSIONS, ERRORS, COMMON-OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH OR DISCOVERY--WAYS TO REDESCRIBE THE FOUNDATIONS-OF ONE SUBJECT IN TERMS OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF ANOTHER, RECIPROCAL PROBLEMS-AND FALLACIES, EQUIVALENT PRINCIPLES AND ENTITIES, JOINT IGNORANCE, NEW-TESTS AND EXPERIMENTS, HIGHER STANDARDS, USEFUL PRIORITIES, STRATEGIES-OF THEORY, ETC.---  IT CAN SUGGEST WAYS IN WHICH TO COMBINE OR TRANSFORM CERTAIN CONCEPTS-OR DIMENSIONS SO AS TO GENERATE OR DEFINE 'ALL' POSSIBLE OR IMPORTANT CONCEPTS-OR THINGS, OR THE SPACES AND MANIFOLDS THEREOF.

THEN AGAIN, THE SUPREME TOPIC OR WHATEVER MAY HAVE SOME TERRIBLE-UNSOLVED PROBLEM OR DIFFICULTY ASSOCIATED WITH IT.---  THUS THE SUPREME CONCERN OF PHYSICS IS NO LONGER CLEAR, THE ARCH CONCERN-OF SOCIOLOGY IS IN DISPUTE, THE GOAL OF PSYCHOLOGY IS IN FLUX, THE ESSENTIAL-NATURE OR DEFINING PROPERTIES OF LIFE ARE UNKNOWN TO THE SCIENCE OF LIFE-(OR TO BIOLOGY), AND EVEN THE BASIC OBJECT OF STUDY OF MATHEMATICS (IT-CANNOT BE--- NUMBER----, THOUGH THE NATURE OF NUMBER IS AN ENIGMA IN ANY-CASE), COSMOLOGY (WHAT IS THE DESCRIBED OR EFFABLE 'UNIVERSE'--- ITSELF-----A PART OF?), AND IDEONOMY (---IDEAS----, AS HINTED ABOVE, MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY-FUNDAMENTAL) IS MYSTERIOUS.---  IDEONOMY CAN BE USED TO DEFINE CONCEPTS IN-NEW AND EVER MORE FUNDAMENTAL-WAYS, AND IT HAS ALREADY BEEN USED TO DEFINE LIFE, OR TO REDUCE IT TO A-SET OF NINETY-TWO FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES. THE SET OF 8,464 POSSIBLE DYADIC-COMBINATIONS OF THE PRIMARY PROPERTIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUCH EXTRAORDINARY-INTEREST THAT THEY PROMISE TO REVOLUTIONIZE THEORETICAL BIOLOGY, SOMETHING-WHICH AT ONCE ILLUSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF CLARIFYING FUNDAMENTALS AND-SUGGESTS THAT THE TRAITS THAT WERE USED TO DEFINE THE PHENOMENON OF "LIFE-"WERE INDEED FUNDAMENTAL.---  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SAME BIT OF IDEONOMIC RESEARCH ALSO HIGHLIGHTED-THE PROBLEMS THAT PLAGUE ALL EFFORTS TO RESOLVE FUNDAMENTALS OR TO GET-AT THE GENUINE FOUNDATIONS OF A SUBJECT; FOR IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SAME-SET OF NINETY-TWO BASIC PROPERTIES OF "LIFE" HAVE EITHER ANALOGS OR EXACT-EQUIVALENTS IN THE SUPPOSEDLY INANIMATE PHENOMENA OF SUBJECTS OTHER THAN-BIOLOGY. THUS FORMS OR ANALOGS OF PROCREATION, NATURAL SELECTION, AND EVOLUTION-EITHER MAY OR DO EXIST IN FIELDS SUCH AS-PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY, GEOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY-,AND COSMOLOGY. THE IMPLICATION MAY VARIOUSLY BE THAT LIFE IS NOT LIMITED-OR PECULIAR TO BIOLOGY, THAT LIFE MUST BE OTHERWISE DEFINED OR DEFINED-VIA OTHER PROPERTIES, THAT THE ESSENTIAL PHENOMENA OF BIOLOGY SHOULD INCLUDE-MORE THAN ORGANISMS, OR THAT BIOLOGY SHOULD BE RECAST INTO A SUPERSCIENCE-INCORPORATING MANY OTHER SCIENCES OR THAT--LIKE MATHEMATICS--APPLIES TO-ALL SCIENCE.---  AN OLD WAY OF ADVANCING THE FOUNDATIONS OF A SUBJECT IS BY IMPROVING-,FORMALIZING, OR AXIOMATIZING ITS LOGIC; AND A NEW OR JUST NOW EMERGING-WAY, BY GIVING THE SUBJECT COGNITIVE FORM, WHICH MEANS THE FORM OF THOUGHT-ITSELF. IDEONOMY CAN HELP WITH BOTH OF THESE APPROACHES, PARTICULARLY IN-CONJUNCTION WITH COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE.----------------------------------------  ERECT FRAMEWORKS FOR THOUGHT--------------  TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ONE NEEDS SOME MANNER OF CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK-,A SCHEMA UPON WHICH TO HANG IDEAS OR IN WHICH TO DEVELOP, INTERWEAVE, AND-EXPERIMENT UPON DIFFERENT CONCEPTS.---  IDEONOMY, IN EFFECT, CAN ENABLE SUCH CONCEPTUAL SCHEMES, STRUCTURES-,AND SYSTEMS TO BE MASS PRODUCED; IT CAN WIDEN THEIR SCOPE, DIVERSIFY THEM-,ENHANCE THEIR POWER, INCREASE THEIR CONNECTIVITY OR INTERRELATEDNESS, GREATEN-THEIR MOBILITY WITHIN AND BETWEEN FIELDS, ENLARGE THEIR RATIONALITY OR-MAKE THEIR LOGIC MORE EXPLICIT, GIVE THE INDIVIDUAL THE POWER TO FREELY-MANIPULATE THEM, ETC.---  THE CONCEPT OF--- MENTAL FRAMEWORKS---- IS SO IMPORTANT TO IDEONOMY-THAT IT NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED UPON.

THEY CAN PROVIDE CLUES FOR PROBING THE-NATURE OF A THING. THEY CAN ENABLE MORE IMAGINATIVE OR LESS PREJUDICED-THOUGHT. THEY CAN HELP ONE TO PREPARE FOR A MORE SERIOUS INTELLECTUAL ENDEAVOR.-THEY CAN HELP ONE RELATE ONE PERSPECTIVE TO ANOTHER, OR PERMIT ONE TO GRASP-A NEW THING BY ANALOGY TO AN OLD OR FAMILIAR THING.--------------------------------------------  ENUMERATE THE FUNCTIONS OF-A THING--------------  THINGS MAY, AND USUALLY DO, HAVE FAR MORE NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE FUNCTIONS-,ROLES, AND IMPORTANCES THAN PEOPLE REALIZE OR WOULD EVEN IMAGINE.--- IF-THIS IS TRUE, IT HAS GREAT SIGNIFICANCE:-------  FEATURES OF OUR WORLD MAY BE CARELESSLY ELIMINATED OR ALTERED BY THE-IGNORANT MARCH OF PROGRESS OR CHANGE; ALL EXISTING THINGS MAY HAVE A WEB-OF ECOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT MERIT STUDY AND RESPECT; THINGS MAY ALL-BE BENEFICIARIES OF MANY MORE THINGS THAN HAS BEEN THOUGHT; THERE MAY BE-AN UNSUSPECTEDLY GREAT NUMBER OF WAYS TO CHANGE AND IMPROVE THE WORLD OR-ITS THINGS; ETC.------  AMONG THE POSSIBLE GENERIC FUNCTIONS OF THINGS ARE----: MEDIATION;-PREVENTION; PROTECTION; CONNECTION; TRANSPORTATION; COMMUNICATION; SYMBOLIZATION;-TESTING; FACILITATION; AMPLIFICATION; IMITATION OR SUBSTITUTION; EXTENSION;-GENERALIZATION; SPECIALIZATION; CORRECTION; IMPROVEMENT; BALANCING; SUBLIMATION-OR DOMESTICATION; COUNTERACTION; ELIMINATION; SUPPLEMENTATION; COMPLEMENTATION;-EXPLOITATION; COPING; HIDING OR DECEPTION; SHOWING; PRODUCTION; CONCENTRATION-OR CONFINEMENT; COMBINATION OR INTEGRATION; SEPARATION, DIVISION, OR LIBERATION;-ORDERING; MAINTENANCE OR SUPPLY; STORAGE, HOLDING, PRESERVATION, OR CONSERVATION;-PREPARATION; INITIATION; CONTROL OR MANAGEMENT; ADJUSTMENT OR MODULATION;-TRANSCENDENCE, CIRCUMVENTION, OR OBVIATION; ORIENTATION; REDUCTION OR ECONOMIZATION-(ENHANCEMENT OF EFFICIENCY); TRANSFORMATION; ETC.------  IDEONOMY CAN HELP ANSWER SUCH QUESTIONS ABOUT FUNCTIONS AS:-------  HOW DO FUNCTIONS OVERLAP?---  WHAT FUNCTIONS ARE COMPETITIVE?

WHAT POLYMORPHISMS-ARE GOOD OR BEST FOR THE SPECIES OF ANT? WHAT WIND VELOCITY AT THE MOUTH-OF AN ANT'S NEST IS OPTIMAL FOR THE COLONY, IN GOOD WEATHER? ARE THERE-CERTAIN EARLY LIFE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE GOOD FOR AN ANT TO HAVE, SAY BECAUSE-THEY TRIGGER THE EMERGENCE OF LATENT INSTINCTS, ORIENT THE ANT FOR LIFE-TO THE PECULIARITIES OF ITS ENVIRONMENT, OR INSTITUTE CERTAIN SKILLS IN-THE THEN- PLASTIC NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE ANT?---  LESSONS HERE COULD BE CARRIED OVER EXPERIMENTALLY TO THE POSSIBLE GOODS-FOR OTHER ANIMAL SPECIES.

THE CASE OF HIERARCHY CAN-SERVE AS A GENERAL EXAMPLE OF WHAT MUST BE DONE AND OF WHAT IS APT TO FOLLOW-UPON THE DOING OF IT.---  WHAT IS MEANT BY THE WORD OR CONCEPT OF HIERARCHY? ONE WAY TO ANSWER-THIS QUESTION IS BY SEEING WHAT HIERARCHY COULD MEAN--OR WHAT HIERARCHIES-MAY IN FACT, OR COULD IN THEORY, EXIST--IN CONNECTION WITH A VARIETY OF-THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE:------  COULD THERE BE A HIERARCHY OF SNOWFLAKES----? ACTUALLY THERE COULD-BE MANY SUCH HIERARCHIES: PRESUMABLY THERE IS A PROBABILITY SPECTRUM FOR-DIFFERENT FLAKE SHAPES; FORMATIVE MECHANISMS MAY BE PLURAL OR SUBJECT TO-COMPLICATION OR EXTERNAL INFLUENCES, IN WHICH CASE EITHER THE CAUSES OR-THEIR EFFECTS MAY CANONICALLY PROGRESS IN CHAINS AND BRANCH IN--CHRONOLOGICAL-OR NOMOLOGICAL-- TREES; PROBABILITY OR EXISTENCE OF CERTAIN FLAKE FORMS-MAY BE A FUNCTION OF THE SET-THEORETIC STATISTICS OR COMBINATORIAL CLUSTERING-OF OTHER FLAKE FORMS; ETC.------  A HIERARCHY OF WINTERS----? PERHAPS WINTERS CAN BE MULTIDIMENSIONALLY-DESCRIBED AND THERE ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF WINTERS THAT ARE ONLY LIKELY TO-TO OCCUR AFTER, OR SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF, CERTAIN SEQUENCES OF OTHER-TYPES OF WINTERS; PERHAPS THERE IS A HIERARCHY OF DESCRIPTIONS OR OF DESCRIPTIVE-ELEMENTS, SUCH THAT CERTAIN DESCRIPTIONS OR ELEMENTS ARE MORE FUNDAMENTAL-OR AT LEAST SIMPLER THAN OTHERS, AND IT IS APPROPRIATE OR NECESSARY TO-'MOVE ALONG' THE HIERARCHY IN ATTEMPTING TO CHARACTERIZE WINTERS; ETC.------  A HIERARCHY OF STARS----? CERTAIN STARS GENERATE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS-AND ISOTOPES THAT ARE THEN RECYCLED IN OTHER STARS AND WITHOUT WHICH THOSE-OTHER TYPES AND GENERATIONS OF-STARS ARE IMPOSSIBLE; SIMILAR STELLAR HIERARCHY-MAY EXIST THANKS TO THE PRODUCTION, RECYCLING, MULTISTAGE TRANSFORMATION-,OR CONTROL OF DIFFERENT MOLECULAR SPECIES BY GENERATIONS--OR PERHAPS BY-SYNCHRONIC HIERARCHIES--OF STARS; HIERARCHICAL SETS OF STARS MAY CREATE-DIFFERENT PHYSICAL CONDITIONS AT A VARIETY OF LEVELS (E.G.
