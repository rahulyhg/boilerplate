STARS IN YOUR EYES---! ASTROLOGICAL FORECASTS FOR UNCOMMON WOMYN AND OTHERS---- BY CHAD HENRY, AFA, NCGR------------------------------------------------------------------------- MARCH ASTROLOGICAL FORECAST------- DO YOU KNOW YOUR MOON SIGN?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MOST OF US KNOW OUR SUN SIGNS  "LIBRA, ARIES, SAGITTARIUS--PISCES, AND SO ON THROUGH -------THE ZODIAC. BUT HOW MANY OF US-KNOW WHAT SIGN THE MOON WAS IN AT THE MOMENT OF OUR------- BIRTH? THOUGH PEOPLE OF ALL SEXES HAVE AN ASTROLOGICAL MOON, WOMEN HAVE A SPECIAL------- AFFINITY FOR THIS MYSTERIOUS LADY OF THE NIGHT---NO MATTER WHERE YOU STAND IN THE------- BUTCH-FEMME LINE-UP. LUNA RULES WOMEN, MOMS, THE PUBLIC, THE TIDES, THE MENSTRUAL------- CYCLE, THE MOODS AND EMOTIONS. SHE IS INTUITIVE AND PSYCHIC. SHE SYMBOLIZES THE GREAT------- GODDESS IN ALL HER PHASES, FROM MAIDEN TO WARRIOR TO MOTHER TO CRONE. PLANTING BY MOON------- SIGN IMPROVES GARDEN PRODUCTION, AND PLANNING BY MOON SIGN-CAN IMPROVE EVERY PHASE OF------- YOUR LIFE. THE MOON RULES HOME, FAMILY, MOTHERHOOD, AND CHILDBIRTH. WHEREAS THE PLANET------- MERCURY RULES THE ANALYTICAL, INTELLECTUAL BRAIN, THE MOON RULES THE ENTIRE MIND, WHICH------- RECEIVES KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM DIRECTLY FROM THE UNIVERSE, THE SUBCONSCIOUS, AND THE------- COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS. SHE ALSO RULES HABITS AND UNCONSCIOUS KNOWLEDGE  "LIKE------- KNOWING HOW TO TIE YOUR SHOES, DRIVE A CAR--CRUISE A CUTIE WITHOUT GETTING BUSTED.---------------------- THE MOON GIVES FORM TO YOUR SUN SIGN, THE WAY A MOTHER GIVES FORM TO THE SPARK THAT------- BECOMES HER CHILD. YOU MAY HAVE A RAMBUNCTIOUS ARIES SUN, BUT WITH A LIBRA MOON-------, YOU   LL WARM UP THAT DRIVE AND ASSERTIVENESS WITH DIPLOMACY, TACT, CONSIDERATION AND------- UNCERTAINTY. WITH A LEO MOON, YOU   RE XENA II!-THERE ARE 144 SUN-MOON------- COMBINATIONS  "WHAT   S YOURS? YOUR LUNAR PHASE AT BIRTH WILL TELL AN ASTROLOGER A LOT------- ABOUT YOUR MISSION IN LIFE, AND THE LUNAR NODES  "A LOT MORE, EVEN, ACCORDING TO INDIAN------- ASTROLOGERS, YOUR TRUE LIFE PATH.---------------------- ALTHOUGH WOMEN AS A RULE SEEM MUCH MORE IN TOUCH WITH-LUNAR ENERGY THAN MEN DO,-STILL-------, WESTERN CIVILIZATION KEEPS TRYING TO STEER US AWAY FROM THE IRRATIONAL, ILLOGICAL, DEEP------- AND ANCIENT WISDOM OF LUNAR ENERGY, AND TOWARD RATIONALITY, LOGIC, "COMMON SENSE-------", CLOCK TIME, SCHEDULES, FACTS AND FIGURES. IN FACT, DON MIGUEL RUIZ, AUTHOR OF THE HIGHLY------- RECOMMENDED "THE FOUR AGREEMENTS", CALLS MODERN URBAN HUMANS "DOMESTICATED".------- WHICH MEANS TAMED, INTIMIDATED, DUMBED DOWN, UPTIGHT, CUT OFF FROM OUR INSTINCTUAL-------, LUNAR SELVES. TO BE TRULY JOYFUL AND CONNECTED, WE NEED THE FREEDOM TO HONOR OUR------- INSTINCTIVE, LUNAR IDENTITY, WHICH IN FACT IS A BIG PART OF OUR OVERALL PERSONALITY-------! LEARNING YOUR MOON SIGN, NATAL LUNAR PHASE, AND SIGN AND HOUSE PLACEMENT OF YOUR------- LUNAR NODES, IS A FIRST STEP TOWARD BETTER SELF-UNDERSTANDING.---------------------- FOR THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE PATHS-OF WICCA, TIBETAN BUDDHISM, AND SO MANY OTHER------- SPIRITUAL PRACTICES, FOLLOWING THE PHASES OF THE MOON- AND CELEBRATING THE-NEW AND FULL------- MOONS EVERY MONTH, ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF WORSHIP. HONORING THE NEW AND FULL MOONS------- MONTHLY, EVEN WITH A SINGLE WHITE CANDLE, CAN HELP TO RECONNECT YOU WHEN YOU   RE------- FEELING LONELY, CUT OFF, DEPRESSED, FLAT AND DULL, OR TRAPPED IN A BORING JOB, A------- FRUSTRATING RELATIONSHIP, AN ENVIRONMENT THAT DOESN   T BRING YOU HAPPINESS. IF YOU------- DON   T HAVE ONE, FIND A PICTURE THAT YOU LOVE OF ANY ONE OF THE GREAT GODDESSES OF------- ANY WORLD RELIGION, FROM VIRGIN MARY TO KALI TO KWAN YIN  "OR EVEN MIX AND------- MATCH!  "MAKE A TINY LITTLE SHRINE TO THE GODDESS ON YOUR BOOKSHELF OR WINDOW SILL, AND------- START WATCHING THE MOON PHASES  "WITH A CALENDAR, THE NEWSPAPER, OR ONE OF THE MANY------- ONLINE RESOURCES THAT TRACK THE PHASES, SUCH AS LUNABAR.COM. LIGHT THAT CANDLE TWICE A------- MONTH ON THE NEW AND FULL MOONS, LIGHT SOME GREAT INCENSE, RING A BELL, GIVE HER A------- BROWNIE OR A GLASS OF VODKA, AND-ASK HER FOR GUIDANCE--WISDOM, LOVE, HEALTH, AND LUCK. -------CONNECT WITH HER DURING YOUR PERIOD, TOO. CHANTING, DRUMMING--DANCING, SINGING, PLAYING------- MUSIC, MAKING FREEFORM ARTWORK, PLAYING GAMES, MEDITATING, CASTING SPELLS, WORKING------- WITH TAROT- I CHING OR RUNES OR-OTHER NON-LINEAR SPIRIT WORK CAN HELP FORGE A-LINK BACK------- TO YOUR LUNAR SELF- AND BACK TO WHOLENESS AND HAPPINESS.---------------------- THE NEW MOON IN MARCH IS THE 14TH  "THE FULL MOON IS ON-THE 28TH. THE NEW MOON IS A------- GREAT TIME TO START A NEW PROJECT. THE FULL MOON IS A TIME TO REAP, AND A TIME TO WRAP UP------- LOOSE ENDS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SINCE MARCH BRINGS THE SPRING EQUINOX AND THE SUN MOVES INTO THE CARDINAL SIGN OF------- ARIES- I   LL GIVE YOU A QUICK THUMBPRINT OF MOON IN ARIES: RESTLESS, IMPATIENT, QUICK-------, FIERY, ASSERTIVE, A NATURAL LEADER  "ARIES MOON LIKES TO BE NUMERO UNO. EVEN WOMEN------- WITH ARIES MOON ARE MALE CHAUVINISTS! THEY---VE ALWAYS GOT ONE EYE ON THE FUTURE AND------- HATE TO WAIT IN LINE, AND SLOWPOKES DRIVE THEM NUTS. THEY-WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT, FREE------- TO COME AND GO AT WILL, AND-THEY WANT TO DO THINGS THEIR OWN WAY. THEY LIKE SPEED AND------- EFFICIENCY. THEIR LEADERSHIP STYLE IS-"YOU CAN FOLLOW ME OR NOT-BUT I   M GONNA BE OUT------- THERE IN FRONT!" A LOT OF FOLKS WITH ARIES MOON WILL TELL YOU THEY HAD HORRIBLE FIGHTS AT------- HOME, ESPECIALLY WITH DAD. THEY TEND TO DRIVE TOO FAST, EVEN THOUGH THEIR SKILLS AND------- COORDINATION ARE USUALLY EXCELLENT. A PARTNER WITH ARIES MOON NEEDS A LONG LEASH.------- UNLESS THE MOON IS COOLED OFF BY A TOUGH ASPECT FROM PLANETS SUCH AS SATURN OR------- NEPTUNE, YOU NEED ACTION, SPEED, AND LOTS OF GOOD LOVIN   .-------------------------- ARIES--------------------------- YOU   LL EXPERIENCE YOUR SOLAR RETURN ON OR NEAR YOUR BIRTHDAY, THE TIME WHEN THE------- TRANSITING SUN COMES HOME TO THE EXACT PLACE OF YOUR NATAL SUN, SETTING THE TONE AND------- THEME FOR THE COMING YEAR.
