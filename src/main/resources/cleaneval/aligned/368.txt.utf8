THE TOY TRAIN RIDE IS A ROMANTIC APPROACH TO THE-------- HIMALAYAS, A MYSTERIOUS REGION. THE LANDSCAPE CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS SPECTACULAR AND THE-------- VIEWS OF THE HIMALAYAN PEAKS BREATHTAKING. THE DARJEELING TOY TRAIN IS ONE OF THE MOST-------- FAMOUS-NARROW (2 FEET ) GAUGE TRAINS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THIS JOY RIDE BEGINS-AT NEW JALPAIGURI, A-BUSY RAILWAY STATION IN-------------THE PLAINS. THE PLAINS ARE MUCH MORE WARMER THAN THE HILLS AND AS THE TRAIN CLIMBS UP THE------------ MOUNTAINS THE CLIMATE GETS MUCH COLDER. THEREFORE IT IS ADVISABLE TO KEEP WARM CLOTHES------------ HANDY AS-ONE NEEDS THEM. LEAVING NEW JALPAIGURI STATION THE TRAIN PASSES THROUGH THE------------ OUTSKIRTS OF SILIGURI TOWN AND REACHES SILIGURI STATION. AFTER A SHORT HALT THE TRAIN------------ LEAVES SILIGURI STATION AND CROSSES THE MAHANADI BRIDGE OVER THE MAHANADI RIVER WHICH------------ FLOWS FROM THE HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AFTER SIX MILES TRAIN REACHES SUKNA STATION FROM WHERE THE REAL------------ ASCENT BEGINS. HERE THE TRAIN NORMALLY STOPS FOR THE ENGINE TO TAKE-WATER. THE TRAVELLER-------------CAN NOW-NOTICE THE CHANGE OF-LOCAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE SHARP MONGOLOID FEATURES AND ARE MOSTLY------------ NEPALI. FROM HERE THE BLUE MOUNTAIN RANGES OF THE FOOTHILLS ARE VISIBLE AND THE TRAIN------------ QUICKLY RISES FROM THE PLAIN PASSING THROUGH TEA GARDENS AND FOREST OF TEAK AND SAL.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE TRAIN NOW PASSES THROUGH RANGTANG STATION (1404 FT/430 M) AND A LITTLE-------- FURTHER AWAY THE TRAIN MAY STOP FOR WATER AGAIN. FROM HERE THE VIEW OF WOODED MOUNTAINS IS-------- REALLY BEAUTIFUL. THE TRAIN MOVES ON WITH THE VIEW OF TEA GARDENS, TEA FACTORIES AND-------- FORESTS. IT THEN PASSES CHUNBHATI. BEFORE THE RAILWAY LINE WAS BUILT, THERE WAS A BUNGALOW-------- HERE WHERE THE TRAVELLERS TRAVELLING IN PALKI (PALANQUIN) USED TO REST FOR THE DAY. THE-------- TRAIN IS NOW FAIRLY AMONG THE MOUNTAINS AND A PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE DEEP VALLEY-AND HIGHER-------- RANGE OF MOUNTAINS IS VISIBLE. THEN THE TRAIN PASSES THE TINDHARIA RAILWAY WORKSHOP TO-------- REACH TINDHARIA STATION (2,822 FEET/860M).------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TINDHARIA, IN THE OLD TIMES--WAS THE SPOT WHERE TRAVELLERS USED TO------------ STOP FOR TEA. FROM HERE ONE CAN GET AN EXTENSIVE VIEW OF THE HILLS. LEAVING TINDHARIA ONE------------ CAN SEE THE JAGGED ROCK-FACED MOUNTAINS UP AHEAD CALLED GIDDAPAHAR (EAGLE'S CRAIG) WHICH------------ THE TRAIN LATER HAS TO PASS THROUGH. USING----- "ZIG-ZAG REVERSES-----" THE TRAIN LEAVES------------ GAYABARI STATION (3,400 FEET/1040M).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AFTER THIS STATION THE TRAIN STOPS-FOR WATER NEAR PAGLA JHORA (MAD TORRENT).-------- DURING THE MONSOON THIS SMALL STREAM SWELLS UP AND IS BIG ENOUGH TO WASH AWAY THE ROAD AND-------- RAILWAY LINE. SHORTLY AFTER THIS THE TRAIN REACHES MAHANADI BAZAR STATION-------- (4,000 FT/1,225M). JUST NEAR THIS TOWN IS THE SOURCE OF THE MAHANADI RIVER-WHICH THE TRAIN HAD --------EARLIER CROSSED SHORTLY AFTER LEAVING SILIGURI. LEAVING MAHANADI THE TRAIN TRAVELS WEST-------- THROUGH GIDHAPAHAR (EAGLE'S CRAIG) WITH AN EXCELLENT VIEW OF THE VALLEY, THE HILLS AND TEA---------GARDENS AND REACHES KURSEONG STATION (4,864 FEET/1485M).------------------------------------------------- KURSEONG IS A THRIVING LITTLE HILL STATION. HERE ONE-CAN GET THE FIRST GLIMPSE-------- OF A HILL TOWN AND THE HILL PEOPLE. LEAVING KURSEONG THE TRAIN PASSES THROUGH KURSEONG-------- BAZAR AND GOES ON IN ITS JOURNEY. THE SIGHT OF TIBETAN PRAYER FLAGS AS THE TRAIN PASSES-------- OVER HUSSEL (WHISTLE) KHOLA (STREAM) MAKES THE TRAVELLER FEEL THAT-HE IS NOW TRULY IN THE-------- MOUNTAINS. THE TRAIN PASSES THROUGH SMALL FORESTS OF MAPLE, CHESTNUT, PEAR--CHERRY--------, CRIPTOMERIA (INTRODUCED FROM JAPAN), ETC. AND CARDAMOM-PLANTS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ NOW THE TRAIN REACHES TUNG-(5656 FT/1725M) WHICH GIVES US AN------------ EXCELLENT VIEW OF THE KURSEONG RIDGE. AS THE TRAIN PASSES ALONG THE ROAD, ONE MAY NOTICE------------ BY NOW THAT THROUGH THE JOURNEY FROM NEW JALPAIGURI TO DARJEELING THERE ARE OVER 100 ROAD------------ CROSSINGS AND MOST OF THE TIME THE TRAIN RUNS ALONG PARALLEL WITH THE CARS AND OTHER------------ VEHICLES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE JOURNEY NEW LEADS THROUGH SONADA (6552 FT. /2000M). AS THE TRAIN PASSES-------- THROUGH SONADA BAZAR, ONE CAN GET A GLIMPSE OF TIBETAN CHORTEN (STUPA) ON THE WAY. NOW THE-------- TRAIN PASSES THROUGH SENCHEL RESERVE FOREST WITH OAKS, CHESTNUTS, WALNUTS, MAGNOLIAS----------RHODODENDRONS, ETC. DURING SPRING ONE-CAN SEE THE BRIGHT BLOOMS OF RHODODENDRONS, CREAM-------- MAGNOLIAS AND ORCHIDS IN THIS-MOSS-LADEN FOREST. ON TOP OF THIS HILL IS-A FAMOUS TOURIST-------- SPOT TIGER HILL WITH A UNIQUE VIEW OF THE HIMALAYAS AND ALSO OF-THE SUNRISE. THIS FOREST-------- REGION IS WELL KNOWN WORLDWIDE FOR BIRD-WATCHING.------------------------------------------------ THE TRAIN NOW PASSES THROUGH A SMALL TOWN CALLED JOREBUNGLOW. THE ROAD HERE IS-------- VERY NARROW AND OFTEN THERE ARE TRAFFIC JAMS SINCE ALL THE TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF-------- DARJEELING PASS THIS POINT. THIS MUST BE THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THE TRAIN MAY HAVE TO STOP-------- FOR A WHILE IN CASE OF A TRAFFIC JAM OR HAVE TO BACK UP A BIT TO EASE THE TRAFFIC. THE-------- TRAIN NOW REACHES GHOOM-----7 FT/2260 M) THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE JOURNEY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVING GHOOM THE TRAIN DESCENDS TOWARDS DARJEELING. ON THE WAY------------ THE TRAIN PASSES THROUGH BATASIA LOOP WITH ITS MEMORIAL TO THE GORKHA SOLDIERS. FROM THE------------ BATASIA LOOP YOU CAN GET A SPECTACULAR VIEW OF DARJEELING TOWN WITH THE KANCHENJUNGA AND------------ OTHER SNOWY MOUNTAINS IN THE BACK-DROP. FROM NOW ONWARDS-UPTILL DARJEELING, THE SNOWY------------ PEAKS ARE IN FULL VIEW FOR THE TRAVELLERS' EYES. FINALLY THE TRAIN ENTERS THE DARJEELINS-------------STATION, THE DESTINATION OF THE JOURNEY. DARJEELING, A TOWN WITH ALL ITS CHARM AND BEAUTY------------ AWAITS THE WEARY TRAVELLER.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SPECIAL TOY TRAIN------------ JOY RIDE---------------------- DURING TOURIST SEASONS, THAT IS, MARCH TO MAY AND OCTOBER TO DECEMBER-----------------, SPECIAL TOY TRAIN JOY RIDE IS ARRANGED-FROM DARJEELING TO GHOOM AND BACK.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
