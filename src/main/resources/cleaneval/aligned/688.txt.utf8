BUGOS-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "THOSE WHO SCORN INFLATION TODAY WILL HAIL IT TOMORROW------------- AS THE LAST BASTION OF PROFITABILITY-----"...ED BUGOS---------------- RISING WEDGIES---------------- SOME MARKET TECHNICIANS, INCLUDING MYSELF, VIEW THE RISING WEDGE-------- AS A COMPLETION PATTERN. IT IS NOT AN EASY PATTERN TO DISCERN, ESPECIALLY-------- IF THE MARKET HAS FOOLED YOU WITH SO MANY MORE EASILY VISIBLE BEARISH-------- SUCKER PLAYS. A RISING WEDGE, AS DISTINCT FROM THE CORRECTIVE BOUNCE-------- THAT IS OFTEN INTERPRETED AS A FLAG WHEN IT TAKES ON THE SAME SHAPE AND-------- SHORTER DURATION, IS OFTEN A FINAL EXTENSION TO A LONG RUNNING BULL LEG.-------- EVEN IF ONE IS SEEN, IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE BECAUSE OF THE BULLISHLY-------- MISLEADING SEQUENCE OF HIGHER HIGHS AND HIGHER LOWS COMING AT A HIGH-------- POINT IN CONFIDENCE FOR THE MARKET.-------------- YET, EVEN THOUGH NOT A CERTAINTY UNTIL PRICES BEGIN TO FALL FROM AND-------- THEREFORE CONFIRM THE PATTERN, ITS IMPLICATIONS ARE THOUGHT TO BE LARGE-------- ENOUGH THAT MANY SPECULATORS TRY TO ANTICIPATE THE BREAK. IN THEORY--------, THESE PATTERNS ARE DEFINED BY A NARROWING IN THE RISING PRICE CHANNEL-------- ON DIMINISHING VOLUME, AND CAN LAST ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO SIX MONTHS--------, SOMETIMES EVEN A LITTLE LONGER. A DIMINISHING, OR PETERING OUT, IN FRESH-------- INVESTMENT INTEREST EXPLAINS BOTH THEIR PRICE BEHAVIOR AND VOLUME BEHAVIOR.-------- AND WHEN THEY DO FALL OUT OF THIS HUMDRUM PATTERN, THE DEGREE OF THE-------- MOVE IS ALMOST ALWAYS SUBSTANTIAL.-------------- VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE STOCK CHARTS BELOW, AND WHICH I USE FOR MY REPORT-------- COME FROM------------------------------------- WWW.STOCKCHARTS.COM------------, MY FAVORITE FREE (FOR NOW) CHARTING WEBSITE------------.---------------- INSIDE THE DOW 30; A FEW IMPORTANT----- "POSSIBILITIES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" I HAVE DELIBERATELY OMITTED MARKING UP THE CHARTS SO THAT YOU MAY MAKE-------- YOUR OWN INTERPRETATION, BUT I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL FIND, IN ALL CASES--------, THAT LONG EXISTING TRENDS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE, THAT VOLUMES HAVE VISIBLY-------- DIMINISHED OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS (OF COURSE IT IS SUMMER, BUT A WEDGE-------- IS A WEDGE), THAT THE INTERMEDIATE TREND CHANNELS HAVE NOTICEABLY NARROWED--------, AND THAT OUTSIDE OF GE, MOMENTUM HAS BEEN GENERALLY DIVERGING, EVEN SO-------- FAR INTO SEPTEMBER. ASK YOURSELF, WHERE IS THIS INDEX WITHOUT THESE COMPONENT-------- STOCKS? NATURALLY, IF THIS ASSESSMENT PROVES CORRECT...---------------- ...THAT WILL NOT BE GOOD---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN BOTH OF THE BLUE CHIP INDEXES ABOVE, MOMENTUM APPEARS SO NEGLIGIBLE-------- AS TO CAST ASIDE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BREAKOUT IN THE BROADER NYSE-------- COMPOSITE (TO THE RIGHT), WHICH ITSELF ALMOST APPEARS TO BE DEVELOPING-------- A SIX MONTH RISING WEDGE. HOWEVER, THAT BEING SAID, THERE IS INDEED A-------- FEW THINGS HAPPENING IN THE STOCK MARKET THAT DESERVE SPECIAL ATTENTION.---------------- A POTENTIAL THEORETICALLY PERFECT NEGATIVE CORRELATION---------------- WALL STREET BULLS WILL SELL THE POWERFUL RALLY IN THE DOW UTILITIES AVERAGE---------- AS A DOUBLE WHAMMY. IF THEIR SLOW GROWTH SCENARIO PANS OUT, THESE PUPPIES---------- SHOULD BENEFIT FROM THE LOWER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, THEY WILL---------- CLAIM. IF THE ENERGY CRISIS ESCALATES ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS A---------- POWERFULLY BULLISH STORY IN THAT DIRECTION FOR THE UTILITIES! BEFORE---------- I GO ON, WHICH OF THE TWO PRECEDING OUTCOMES DO YOU THINK THAT THE---------- BELOW CHARTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCOUNTING?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ IF YOU GUESSED THE LATTER, YOU ARE DEAD ON. AT LEAST FOUR AMERICAN UTILITY-------- ICONS ARE POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A GROWING GLOBAL NEED FOR ALTERNATE-------- POWER INFRASTRUCTURES LESS RELIANT ON OIL AND GAS. THESE COMPANIES ARE-------- CLEARLY THE GLOBAL LEADERS OF CHOICE IN SUCH AN UNDERTAKING, MANY OF-------- THEM HAVING BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS THE FED AND PERHAPS MORE NECESSARY--------, IF THE ENERGY PROBLEM LITERALLY TURNS INTO A CRISIS. THEREFORE, I WOULD-------- SUGGEST THAT THE DEVELOPING NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH THE DOW TRANSPORTS-------- SUPPORTS THIS LATTER, MORE INTERESTING-GROWTH STORY.-------------- WHILE BOTH AVERAGES MAY BENEFIT FROM LOWER INTEREST RATES, ONLY ONE-------- CAN TRULY BENEFIT FROM AN ENERGY CRISIS. THE FOLLOWING COMPANIES HAVE-------- SPENT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES, AND PERHAPS EVEN TIME, POSITIONING THEMSELVES-------- TO BENEFIT FROM THIS, GLOBALLY. THEY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND CAPITAL TO-------- OFFER MANY OIL DEPENDENT ECONOMIES AN ALTERNATIVE, HIGHER TECH SOLUTION-------- TO THEIR ENERGY PROBLEMS. SO PUT DOWN YOUR BENJAMIN GRAHAM TEXTBOOK AND-------- CHECK OUT THESE CHARTS:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ GLANCING AT THESE STOCK CHARTS, ONE MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT THERE ARE SOME-------- BIG THINGS HAPPENING HERE. UNDENIABLY, HE OR SHE WOULD BE CORRECT. THERE-------- ARE, BUT AGAIN, THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH LOWER-INTEREST RATES OR-------- DEFENSIVE INVESTING, AND THEY HAVE EVERYTHING TO-DO WITH INCREASINGLY---------BULLISH EXPECTATIONS FOR GLOBAL DEMAND TO STEP UP FOR ALTERNATIVE POWER-------- INFRASTRUCTURES. COMICALLY, IF WALL STREET REALLY GETS BEHIND THIS----- "REMARKABLE-----" STORY--------, THEY WILL HAVE TO DENOUNCE THEIR GOLDILOCKS ALLEGIANCE! THERE IS NO DOUBLE---------WHAMMY HERE. LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY; WITHOUT A POTENTIAL OIL CRISIS,---------THERE IS NO REAL POTENTIAL FOR THIS UTILITIES PLAY.-------------- ADDITIONALLY, IF OPEC'S----,000 DAILY BARREL ADDITION DOESN'T QUELL-------- OIL PRICES IMMEDIATELY THIS WEEK AND INFLATION NUMBERS COME IN ON THE-------- HIGH SIDE OF EXPECTATIONS, MOMENTUM MAY CARRY THESE STOCKS FURTHER, AT --------LEAST FOR A WEEK OR SO. HOWEVER, I PERSONALLY AM INCLINED TO WAIT OUT-------- THE HIGHLY PROBABLE SECOND BEAR LEG IN THE REST OF THE MARKET TO UNFOLD-------- FIRST. THAT'S RIGHT, SECOND.----------------- ON THE OTHER HAND, GO GOLDILOCKS GO---------------- RUMORS SURFACED IN GERMANY MIDWEEK THAT EUROPE'S BIGGEST BANKING GROUP----------, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, IS IN TALKS TO ACQUIRE THE MIGHTY JP MORGAN. CAN---------- ANYBODY APPRECIATE THE POLITICS BEHIND THIS SUPPOSED DEAL AS MUCH AS---------- I CAN? I NEVER SAW IT COMING. ANYWAY, BY THE END OF THE WEEK, MORGAN'S---------- CFO, PETER HANCOCK HANDED IN HIS RESIGNATION TO PURSUE LONGSTANDING-----------ENTREPRENEURIAL INTERESTS. IN THE END, THIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE NOTHING---------- BUT A DIFFERENCE IN OPINION, AT WORST. BUT IF IT WERE NOTHING, WHY---------- WOULD HE NOT PUT OFF HIS RESIGNATION UNTIL AFTER THIS WHOLE THING WAS---------- OVER, BEING SORT OF A KEY PERSON IN A MAJOR ACQUISITION AND ALL? ANYWAY---------- YOU SLICE IT; IT STILL IS A RED FLAG.-------------- IS THE US INVESTMENT BUSINESS FOR SALE? THIS IS THE THOUGHT THAT HAD-------- CROSSED MY MIND WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS MERGER TALK ON WEDNESDAY, BEFORE-------- MR. HANCOCK'S RESIGNATION. IT IS THE THOUGHT THAT CROSSED MY MIND WHEN-------- DLJ SOLD OUT TO CREDIT SUISSE GROUP RECENTLY. THE-SEED FOR THAT THOUGHT--------, HOWEVER, ACTUALLY OCCURRED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE UBS ACQUISITION OF PAINE-------- WEBBER. THE REASON IS THAT-I HAD JUST FINISHED THE------------------------------- POLITICS-------- OF THE DOLLAR----, WHERE I HAD PUT FORTH THAT THE US IS NOW VULNERABLE-------- TO POLITICAL EXTORTION ON ACCOUNT OF POTENTIALLY DISCONTENT FOREIGN DOLLAR-------- OWNERS. IN OTHER WORDS,-THE BALANCE OF POLITICAL POWER WILL SHIFT TO-------- FOREIGN DOLLAR OWNERS AS LONG AS US POLITICIANS WILL WANT TO KEEP THEM-------- FROM SELLING OFF THE CURRENCY (TO PREVENT INFLATION). LET ME EXPLAIN.------------- THESE EVENTS HAVE BEEN DRIVING M&A SPECULATION IN THE US FINANCIAL SECTOR-------- TO NEW HEIGHTS--DRAGGING ALONG WITH IT THE DOLLAR/EURO EXCHANGE RATE.-------- THE BIG MONETARY PROBLEM FACING THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS THE CIRCULATION-------- OF EXCESS DOLLARS. THEREFORE, I SUGGEST THAT IT IS IN THE US INTEREST--------, IN ORDER TO FORESTALL A DOLLAR CRISIS AT THIS POINT, TO CONVERT FOREIGN-------- SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS INTO LONG-TERM FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. AND I BELIEVE-------- THAT IT IS IN EUROPE'S DOLLAR OWNER'S INTERESTS TO FIND SOMETHING USEFUL-------- TO DO WITH ALL OF THEIR EXCESS DOLLARS. SO WHILE THE EUROPEANS ARE BUSY-------- BUYING US BANKS FROM DAY TRADERS AT RECORD HIGHS, AMERICAN FINANCIAL-------- INTERESTS MAY BE BUYING FAILED ASIAN BANKS, CHEAPLY. THIS IS NOTHING-------- BUT AN OBSERVATION AT THIS POINT BUT IT IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE IN MY-------- SECOND TO LAST REPORT,-------------------------------- INFLATION VERSUS-------- DEFLATION----, I SUGGEST THAT JAPAN IS A NET GLOBAL CREDITOR AND THEREFORE-------- MOST LIKELY TO SURVIVE THE CURRENCY DEBACLE THAT IS RIGHT AROUND THE-------- CORNER.------------- EVEN WORSE, HOWEVER, IS THAT THESE HEADLINES TAKE AWAY FROM ALL THE-------- OTHER GARBAGE THAT THE EUROPEANS ARE BUYING. I HAVE OBSERVED, IN PREVIOUS-------- RESEARCH, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FALLING EURO AND THE RISING ISSUANCE-------- OF US ASSET BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER, SPECIFICALLY FINANCE COMPANY DEBT-------- OR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT CREDIT. MY CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE US FINANCIAL-------- SECTOR HAS BEEN MONETIZING LOW QUALITY DEBT IN THIS LAST CYCLE. THIS-------- ARGUMENT CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN THE REPORT-------------------------------- INFLATION-------- VERSUS DEFLATION----. INTERESTINGLY, IN AN AUGUST 31 ISSUE OF--CAPITAL-------- ISSUES------------," ENTITLED "WATCH RESERVES, NOT RATES", THE AUTHOR-------- POINTS TO A STRIKING 0.88 CORRELATION BETWEEN US COMMERCIAL BANK PAPER-------- AND-THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL-BANK ASSETS. THIS IS-THE FIRST TIME I HAD-READ-------- THEIR QUALITY WORK.--------------------- "OPERATION DISCREDIT GATA-----," IS WELL UNDER WAY----------------! NORMALLY, I STAY AWAY FROM ARGUING ANY CLAIMS THAT I CANNOT PROPERLY---------- BEAR OUT, WHICH IS WHY YOU WILL FIND LITTLE ON THE TOPIC OF MANIPULATION----------, OTHER THAN THE OCCASIONAL RESTRAINED INFERENCE, IN ANY OF MY OTHER---------- RESEARCH. THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS. FIRST, CONSPIRACY THEORIES---------- ARE FAR TOO EASY TO DISCREDIT, AND SHOULD THE ALLEGATIONS ACTUALLY---------- BE TRUE, THE THEORISTS WILL SURELY BE TARGETED. SECOND, I HAVE LONG---------- AGO ACCEPTED THAT MANY MARKETS, ESPECIALLY GOLD, JUST SIMPLY GET MANIPULATED---------- ANYHOW. WHY WOULDN'T THEY? IN FACT, MR. GREENSPAN HIMSELF SAID THIS---------- RECENTLY WHILE SPEAKING ABOUT THE RAPID PACE OF CHANGE AND INNOVATION---------- IN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM:----------------- THE RAPIDLY CHANGING INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CLIMATE IS CERTAIN TO---------- CREATE NOSTALGIA FOR THE GOLD STANDARD AMONG THOSE OF US ENGAGED TO---------- REPLACE IT - PARAPHRASE.------------------ SOME SKILLED TRADERS, AS WELL AS MYSELF, PURPORT TO SEE IT IN THE TAPE-------- ON FAR MORE OCCASIONS THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON MIGHT WANT TO BELIEVE.-------- THE WHACKED OUT GOLD/SILVER RATIOS, GOLD/OIL RATIOS, AND GOLD/ASSET RATIOS-------- ARE ENOUGH TO AT LEAST LEGITIMIZE ANY INQUIRY INTO SUCH MANIPULATION.-------- GLOBAL BANKERS WHO DECLARE THAT IT REPRESENTS AN UNPROFITABLE INVESTMENT-------- IN THE NEW ECONOMY EASILY MEET EVERY RISE IN THE DEMAND FOR GOLD WITH-------- THEIR OWN SUPPLY, UNWITTINGLY IMPROVING ITS FUNDAMENTALS WITH EACH OUNCE-------- THAT IS SOLD FROM THEIR VAULTS TO THE PUBLIC. AND EVEN WHILE GLOBAL MONETARY-------- FUNDAMENTALS ARGUABLY IMPROVE TO GOLD'S ADVANTAGE RELATIVE TO THE INTERNATIONAL-------- RESERVE CURRENCY'S OUTLOOK, REVEALING AN ENORMOUSLY CONSPICUOUS ANOMALY-------- ON THE CHART, THE WORLD GOLD COUNCIL CLAIMS THAT IT IS CERTAIN THAT THERE-------- EXISTS NO SUCH MANIPULATION.------------- IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT THE FED MANIPULATES INTEREST RATES, AND-------- UNTIL RECENTLY, MONEY SUPPLY AS WELL. IT IS ALSO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT-------- THE GOVERNMENT MANIPULATES (UNDER THE GUISE OF REGULATION OR SOME MISGUIDED-------- POLICY DIRECTIVE) MANY OTHER ECONOMIC DYNAMICS IN OUR INTEREST, PRESUMABLY.-------- DO WE NEED A SPECIAL BRIEFING BY THE CIA TO BELIEVE WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW-------- IS LIKELY TRUE? THE QUESTION THEREFORE IS WHY ARE THEY TRYING SO HARD-------- TO DENY IT? PERHAPS BECAUSE IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH A PLAUSIBLE-------- ARGUMENT AS TO WHY IT IS IN OUR BEST INTEREST, BUT POSSIBLY ALSO BECAUSE-------- THEY HAVE LEARNT HOW EFFECTIVE OUTRIGHT DENIAL OF ANY WRONGDOING CAN-------- BE, ESPECIALLY IN DEALING WITH A PUBLIC THAT HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN-------- THEIR PAPER.-------------- WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE IT CAN BE TREACHEROUS AS A PROFESSIONAL TRADER-------- NOT TO ASSUME THAT SOMEONE IS PLAYING MARKET GAMES. THERE IS ALWAYS A-------- SHEPHERD.----------------- THE HARDER THEY TRY, THE MORE OBVIOUS THEY BECOME----------------- SO SUDDENLY, I FIND MYSELF TALKING ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT I HAD ALWAYS---------- PERSONALLY VIEWED AS AN OVERLY MASHED POTATO. THE REASON IS THAT AS---------- A BROKER, WHEN A PROMOTER WOULD APPROACH ME WITH A DEAL AND BECOME---------- AGGRAVATED BY MY QUESTIONS, HE WOULD PULL OUT A THICK TECHNICAL REPORT----------, SOMETIMES AS LONG AS 100 PAGES OR MORE, IN THE HOPE THAT I WOULD BE---------- SATISFIED WITH THE PROJECT SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE ALREADY UNDERTOOK---------- THE DUE DILIGENCE, PRESUMABLY ON MY BEHALF. THOUGH, TO HIS NEGATIVE---------- SURPRISE, UPON READING THROUGH THE MUMBO JUMBO, I WOULD FIND NOT ONLY---------- THAT I HAD EVEN MORE ANNOYING QUESTIONS, BUT ALSO THAT I SUDDENLY KNEW---------- MORE ABOUT THE ENTIRE VENTURE THAN HE DID.-------------- SIMILARLY, DR. JESSICA CROSS' RECENT 200-PAGE REPORT CALLED----- "GOLD-------- DERIVATIVES GROWTH UNSUSTAINABLE-----" RELEASED ON 4 SEPTEMBER --------------HAS LITERALLY DRAGGED ME OUT OF THE CLOSET ON THIS MASHED POTATO.----------------- THE DEFINITION OF SPIN---------------- LOTS OF SPIN IS GOING ON OUT THERE THESE DAYS--THOUGH IT USED TO BE-CALLED---------- NONSENSE IN THE OLD ECONOMY. MY 1984 POCKET OXFORD USES TERMS LIKE---------- SPINNING, TWISTING, AND MANIPULATING A YARN TO DEFINE THE TERM IN ITS---------- LINGUISTICALLY INTENDED-FORM. BUT BY FAR, MR. DON MATHEWS AT MISES.ORG---------- WROTE THE MOST INTERESTING DEFINITION I HAVE EVER COME BY, WHICH-I---------- VIEW AS RELEVANT TO THE BUSINESS OF MONEY ALSO. IN AN ARTICLE TITLED----- "GORE---------- ON OIL-----," HE SAID THAT:----------------- HIS (GORE'S) CHARGE OF CONSPIRACY AND PRICE GOUGING IS SPIN. SPIN---------- IS THE POLITICAL CLASS EUPHEMISM FOR CALCULATED MENDACITY, FOR PLANNED---------- DISTORTION, FOR TWISTING AND CONTORTING FACT AND REASON UNTIL TRUTH---------- BECOMES ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO DECIPHER. IN THE NORMAL WORLD, SPIN IS---------- THOUGHT OF WITH DISGUST. BUT IN THE POLITICAL-WORLD, SPIN IS A TOOL----------, AND THE HANDIEST TOOL AT THAT; AND THOSE WHO USE SPIN WITH SKILL RISE---------- HIGH IN POLITICS.----------------- IN THE FINANCIAL BUSINESS AS WELL, HE SHOULD HAVE ADDED. FOR AS THE-------- PRICE OF GOLD DECLINES AND BANKERS CONTINUE TO SATISFY EXCESS DEMAND-------- WITH THEIR OWN GOLD----- "RESERVES-----," THE SPIN THEY HAVE FOUND MOST-------- OPPORTUNISTIC IS THAT GOLD'S MONETARY SIGNIFICANCE HAS DIMINISHED. AND-------- THEY HAVE DONE MUCH TO--- TWIST AND CONTORT FACT AND REASON UNTIL TRUTH-------- HAS BECOME ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO DECIPHER----. IN FACT, THE SAME BRUTE-------- FORCE TACTICS APPEAR TO HAVE EVOLVED IN THE FINANCIAL STOCKS OF LATE-------- MENTION, AND THE SPIN THEY WEAVE (IF THAT MAKES SENSE) IS EUROPEAN ENDORSEMENT-------- OF THE LEGITIMACY OF US FINANCIAL INTERESTS.---------------- WHERE IS THE MOTIVE, THEY ASK?---------------- ODDLY, UNLIKE MANIPULATING INTEREST RATES OR EXCHANGE RATES OR OIL PRICES---------- OR DAIRY PRICES OR LABOR PRICES OR WHAT HAVE YOU-----, "SPEAKING-----" ABOUT---------- THE MANIPULATION IN GOLD PRICES IS A GRAVE TABOO.-------------- AND THERE IS AN EXCELLENT REASON FOR THAT. IT IS SIMPLY THIS: THERE-------- HAS NEVER BEEN SUCH A COMPARABLY LONG PERIOD OF PAPER MONEY PROSPERITY-------- AS DURING THIS PAST THIRTY-YEARS OR SO, EVIDENTLY. IT IS NORMALLY PERCEIVED-------- THAT THIS KIND OF PROSPERITY WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE ON A GOLD STANDARD;-------- IN AS SHORT A TIME AS IT IS WITHOUT ONE, AT LEAST. THAT IS BECAUSE ON-------- A GOLD STANDARD, WE HAVE TO ACCEPT SOME MONETARY DISCIPLINE FROM TIME-------- TO TIME. ON A----- "PAPER-----" MONETARY SYSTEM, WE CAN-WILL-AND-HAVE-------- POSTPONED THE UNKIND----- "DISCIPLINE-----," DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT-------- COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS THE LENDER-OF-LAST-RESORT-------- MODEL. AT SOME NEARBY POINT IN THE FUTURE THIS WILL PROBABLY COME AT-------- AN ENORMOUS COST. CONVERSELY, ON A THEORETICALLY PROPER GOLD STANDARD--------, THE AVERAGE ENTREPRENEUR CAN AT LEAST BE REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT HE-------- CAN KEEP ANY WEALTH THAT IS CONQUERED FOR LONGER THAN, SAY A COUPLE OF-------- DECADES.------------- WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THIS POSITION MANY TIMES IN THE PAST, AND IF-YOU-------- WOULD LIKE TO REVIEW OUR ARGUMENTS, PLEASE VISIT OUR-------------------- HOMEPAGE---- AND-------- PICK OUT ANY ONE OF OUR ARCHIVED REPORTS. YOU OUGHT TO AT LEAST AGREE-------- THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VISIBLE LACK OF FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE IN RECENT-------- YEARS, WHATEVER THAT MAY MEAN TO YOU. SO, WHEN DR. JESSICA CROSS SUGGESTS--------, THROUGH THE FAZ------------, THAT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE GATA HAVE NOT EVEN-------- TOUCHED ON POSSIBLE MOTIVE, SHE HAS CLEARLY UNDER READ THE CONTENT AT-------- ANY OF THE WEBSITES THAT WE PUBLISH THROUGH, INCLUDING GATA'S.-------------- IN SHORT FORM, IT IS MY CONTENTION THAT ULTIMATELY THIS COST WILL MANIFEST-------- IN A LOSS OF CONFIDENCE AND PURCHASING POWER OF THE PAPER CURRENCY WITH-------- THE WEAKEST FUNDAMENTALS, WHICH HAVE LESS TO DO WITH ANY DECEPTIVE PRODUCTIVITY-------- EDGE, THAN THEY HAVE TO DO WITH OTHER MORE COMPLEX MONETARY ISSUES, SUCH-------- AS THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCES OF PROFLIGATE DOLLAR IMPERIALISM. NEVERTHELESS--------, BY THEN WE SHALL SEE WHERE ALL OF THE FALSE WEALTH HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED-------- TO, AND WE MAY THEN POSSIBLY EVEN LOSE FAITH IN THE SPIN WEAVING BANKING-------- SYSTEM - DARE I SAY IT. AND IF WE WERE SO BRAVE AS TO TRY AND REVERT-------- BACK TO THE COHERENT ECONOMIC LOGIC BEHIND "SOUND MONEY," WHICH WAS RESPONSIBLE-------- FOR MANY OF THE ENORMOUS AND REAL ECONOMIC EXPANSIONS OF PREVIOUS CENTURIES--------, THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN 1908 MAY HAVE TO COMPLETELY-------- DISMANTLE. THAT CERTAINLY EXPLAINS THE TABOO, DON'T YOU THINK------------- LET ME WARN RIGHT NOW, THAT THIS LINE OF REASONING, AS LOGICAL AS IT-------- INDEED MAY BE, RANKS VERY HIGH ON THE CONTROVERSY SCALE. WHY DON'T YOU-------- PRACTICE IT ON YOUR NEAREST NEIGHBOR AND WATCH HIS OR HER HAUGHTY REACTION--------, JUST FOR FUN? THIS DOES NOT MEAN THE ARGUMENT IS WRONG, BUT WILL ONLY-------- REVEAL THAT YOUR NEIGHBOR OWNS STOCKS. IT TOOK A LONG, LONG TIME FOR-------- THE FED TO BECOME AS POWERFUL AS IT IS TODAY, WHERE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS-------- OF INVESTORS WATCH MR. GREENSPAN'S EVERY SINGLE MOVE, AS IF THEY KNEW-------- WHAT TO DO WITH THE WORTHLESS INFORMATION.------------- GIVEN ALL OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, HOW HARD DO YOU THINK THAT IT WOULD-------- BE FOR ANY POWERFUL FINANCIAL INTEREST TODAY TO PERSUADE AN "EXPERT" TO-------- DENOUNCE SUCH MANIPULATION THAT EVERYONE ALREADY KNOWS EXISTS? AND IF-------- OUR ECONOMICS ARE RIGHT, WHICH THEY PROBABLY ARE, THE MOTIVE FOR MANIPULATING-------- GOLD PRICES COULD NOT BE GREATER AT ANY TIME IN HISTORY THAN IT IS TODAY.---------------- THE IRONY OF POWER---------------- THE ONLY REAL MISTAKE THAT THE FED HAD EVER MADE, IN TERMS OF DEFENDING---------- ITS POWER, WAS TO ALLOW THE MONETARY INFLATION TO OVERCOME THE ECONOMY---------- AND MANIFEST IN PROFUSE QUANTITIES OF LOW QUALITY SECURITIES, WHICH---------- ARE NOW OWNED BY TOO MANY WEAK HANDS. HERE IS THE IRONY; THESE----- "HANDS-----" NOW---------- HAVE THE POWER TO DECIDE THE FED'S DESTINY. SO YES, EXPECT THE----- "EXPERT-----" NONSENSE---------- TO INTENSIFY, AS THERE ARE FEW MARKETS OTHER THAN GOLD, WHERE----- "THEY-----" MAY---------- STILL EXERT AN ADVANTAGEOUS, AND MORE DIRECT INFLUENCE. THE NEXT FEW---------- YEARS SHOULD PROVE VERY INTERESTING TO THIS ARGUMENT.---------------- GOLD AND PAPER HAVE BECOME MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE---------------- IN HER REPORT, DR. JESSICA CROSS EXAMINES THE WHOLE ARGUMENT ABOUT GOLD---------- DERIVATIVES AND WHETHER THERE EXISTS ANY MANIPULATION OF GOLD PRICES---------- AT ALL. WHEN I FIRST GLANCED AT THE 200-PAGE PHASE ONE PROJECT, I THOUGHT---------- TO MYSELF, WHAT A WASTE OF %#&! TIME AND MONEY. MINE TOO. NONETHELESS----------, IT IS MY OBLIGATION TO ANSWER THE CALL. IN THE PREAMBLE, JESSICA STATES---------- THAT:--------------------- "AS VIRTUAL METALS NOTED IN THE INITIAL PROPOSAL FOR THIS STUDY----------, ANY DETAILED RESEARCH INTO THE DERIVATIVE PHENOMENON WOULD PROBABLY---------- GENERATE AS MANY QUESTIONS AS IT PROVIDED ANSWERS. THIS HAS INDEED---------- BEEN THE CASE AND CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT FURTHER WORK---------- IS WARRANTED.----------------------- " HERE ARE A FEW OF MY----- "INITIAL-----" STUPID QUESTIONS:---------------  WHO IS GOING TO ACTUALLY STUDY THIS ENORMOUS INTIMIDATING LOOKING---------- PILE OF BUREAUCRATIC NONSENSE BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS OVER?---------------  WHY DID THE WORLD GOLD COUNCIL ASSERT THEIR CONFIDENCE IN PREVIOUS-------- NUMBERS AT THE GOLD CONFERENCE IN FRANCE ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO, IF THEY-------- HAD YET TO EVEN COMPLETE SUCH A STUDY?---------------  IF THERE ARE MANY MORE QUESTIONS NOW THAN BEFORE, WHERE DOES SHE GET-------- OFF MAKING ANY CONCLUSIONS WHATSOEVER ABOUT ANYTHING?------------- I SUPPOSE THAT ONE HAS TO JUSTIFY THE SCARCE RESOURCES (SHE APPARENTLY-------- IS DOING THIS WORK FOR THE SUPPOSEDLY IMPOVERISHED GOLD INDUSTRY) ALLOCATED-------- TO THIS PROJECT UNDERTAKING THAT APPEARS TO BE MOTIVATED MAINLY TO DISCREDIT-------- GATA'S CONCLUSIONS, AND THAT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO DO IF THE CONCLUSION-------- IS THAT GATA MAY ACTUALLY BE RIGHT.---------------- EVERYBODY HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN SOMETHING---------------- THE FAZ REPORTED THE DISCOVERY THAT MANY OF GATA'S SUPPORTERS HAVE PERSONAL---------- MONETARY INTERESTS BEHIND THEIR ACCUSATIONS. I AM GLAD THEY NOTICED.---------- I CERTAINLY DO.------------- IF THESE PEOPLE WANT TO ACCUSE THE LITTLE PISSED OFF GUYS OF HAVING-------- A VESTED INTEREST IN WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT, I DEMAND THAT THEY-------- SHOW ME AN EXAMPLE WHERE THAT ISN'T THE CASE FOR ANYONE ELSE!!! I GATHER-------- THAT I DO NOT NEED TO LIST MANY EXAMPLES HERE.-------------- THE WGC AND GFMS, REPRESENTING THE GOLD INDUSTRY, UNQUESTIONABLY HAVE-------- A VESTED INTEREST IN KEEPING GOLD PRICES DOWN, FOR EXAMPLE. AT LEAST-------- UNTIL THE INDUSTRY'S MOST IMPORTANT PRODUCERS UNWIND THEIR OFFSIDE HEDGES.-------- THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT A SIGNIFICANT----- "MAJORITY-----" OF GOLD-------- PRODUCERS COULD LOSE A LOT OF MONEY SHOULD GOLD PRICES DOUBLE TOO QUICKLY.-------- IN FACT, SUCH AN EVENT COULD EASILY ESCALATE AS THE WEAKER PRODUCERS-------- WOULD RUN INTO SOLVENCY PROBLEMS AND CONSEQUENTLY, INTO PRODUCTION DELAYS-------- BECAUSE THEY SUDDENLY CANNOT AFFORD TO FINANCE THEIR DAILY OPERATION.-------- SO YES, EVEN THE GOLD INDUSTRY HAS A BEARISH VESTED INTEREST IN THE GOLD-------- BUSINESS TODAY-------------! IF THESE----- "PEOPLE-----" REALLY WANT TO USE THAT ANGLE, I AM SURE-------- THAT GATA CAN MULTIPLY IT TENFOLD-----------------! THE PRISONER'S DILEMMA---------------- ALMOST ONE YEAR AGO NOW, ON THE EVE OF THE SIGNING OF THE WASHINGTON---------- AGREEMENT, A FRIEND OF MINE DUBBED THE SITUATION A----- "PRISONER'S---------- DILEMMA-----" BECAUSE AS LONG AS NO ONE ELSE WOULD COVER THEIR SHORTS---------- ALL WOULD BE OK, BUT UNDER THIS-THEORETICAL QUANDARY--SUCH AN OUTCOME---------- IS OBVIOUSLY A UTOPIAN FANTASY. THE DR. JESSICA CROSS DOCUMENT LOOKS---------- MORE LIKE A----- "PRISONER'S TALE-----" THAN A REVELATION, CREATED---------- ONLY TO BUY THE PRISONERS SOME BADLY NEEDED TIME WHILE THEY ALL CONTINUE---------- TO CHEAT ON EACH OTHER. THOUGH I HAVE ONLY STUDIED A PART OF IT SO---------- FAR, I AM PARTICULARLY THRILLED WITH THIS COMMENT IN HER REPORT:--------------------- "THIS SWIFT EVOLUTION (TOWARD DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS--IS EVIDENCE---------- THAT THE DERIVATIVES ARE A NATURAL AND THRIVING CONCOMITANT OF A FREE---------- MARKET IN GOLD. PERHAPS FOR THIS REASON ALONE THEIR PRESENCE SHOULD---------- BE ACCEPTED RATHER THAN ESCHEWED.----------------------- " THE DOCUMENT MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE--------! FOR ONE THING, IN THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE-OVERVIEW ON PAGE 14 IT IS-------- CLAIMED THAT:--------------------- "THIS RESEARCH NEITHER ENDORSES NOR DENOUNCES THE USE OF DERIVATIVES---------- IN GENERAL.-----------------------" THESE CONTRADICTORY COMMENTS ARE ONLY A FEW PAGES APART. WHERE IS HER-------- CREDIBILITY? AGAIN, I WILL REPEAT FOR HER OWN BENEFIT IF SHE EVER-READS-------- THIS--THAT DERIVATIVES ARE-INDEED A NATURAL-EVOLUTION IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY-------- THAT HAS DEVELOPED ON TOP OF AN UNSTABLE FIAT MONETARY-EXPERIMENT, BLAH--------, BLAH AND BLAH.-------------- I REALLY DO NOT CARE WHAT YOUR CREDENTIALS ARE. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT-------- THIS ARGUMENT BECAUSE YOU ARE A PAPER BULL, THAT IS ONE THING, BUT IF-------- YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS ARGUMENT WHILE YOU ARE SUPPOSEDLY REPRESENTING-------- THE----- "GOLD-----" INDUSTRY, YOU EITHER DON'T KNOW THE-FIRST THING-------- ABOUT MONEY AND CREDIT, OR YOU ARE A LIAR--------------! NO WONDER THE FAZ CLAIMS THAT GATA HASN'T SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED THE-------- MOTIVES BEHIND WHY ANYONE WOULD EVEN WANT TO MANIPULATE GOLD PRICES-------- - THEY OBVIOUSLY DID NOT READ OR UNDERSTAND THE DIVERSITY OF ARGUMENTS-------- THAT GATA HAS WORKED HARD TO-PRESENT.-DR. JESSICA CROSS SHOULD HAVE SPENT-------- MORE TIME STUDYING ECONOMICS THAN STATISTICS OR THE ANECDOTAL CONSENSUS-------- IN THE CAB DRIVING INDUSTRY, FOR THEN SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SEE-------- THE FOREST.----------------- WHAT IS SO BAD ABOUT FIAT ANYHOW?---------------- MR. BIRNBAUM, IN A 1996 REPORT------------ TO THE JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE--------, CONCLUDES THAT THE DERIVATIVES BUSINESS IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY WERE-------- THERE TO BE LESS VOLATILITY IN THE FREE FLOATING FIAT EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM-------- IN THE FIRST PLACE. HE MAKES THE CASE, AND IF HE DOESN'T I DO, THAT THIS-------- VOLATILITY IS ALSO UNNECESSARY, AND ONLY EXISTS AS A RESULT OF AN UNSTABLE-------- AND MISGUIDED (POLITICIZED) MONETARY POLICY. THUS, THE ENORMOUS GROWTH-------- IN THE UNNECESSARY DERIVATIVES BUSINESS (WHICH I AM SURE DR. CROSS HAS-------- A VESTED INTEREST IN--IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THIS UNNECESSARY EXCHANGE-------- RATE VOLATILITY.-------------- A SECONDARY RESULT, HE SUGGESTS, IS THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE WORLD HAS-------- MOVED AWAY FROM THE REAL ECONOMY AND HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY ASSET SPECULATION-------- AND GENERAL GOODS ARBITRAGE. HE IS MORE RIGHT TODAY THAN EVER. IN-------- 1999, I OBSERVED THIS OUTCOME ON MY OWN--CAPTURED NICELY IN THE FOLLOWING CHART-------- BY--------------------------------------------------- ALAN NEWMAN------------) AND DUBBED THE US ECONOMY A STOCK MARKET ECONOMY TO MY CLIENTS. HOWEVER--------, MANY BULLS STILL INSIST THIS IS ALL ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW ECONOMY-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------! I'LL SAY. THEREFORE, IN THIS CONTEXT, YOU BET THAT DERIVATIVES ARE A-------- NECESSARY EVOLUTION. THAT IS NOT IN QUESTION. THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS-------- NEXT? MANY ECONOMISTS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PROVE THE GROWING INSTABILITY-------- OF THIS MONETARY SYSTEM, OR SYSTEMIC FINANCIAL MARKET RISK, AND ANYONE-------- THAT WORKS FOR THE GOLD INDUSTRY SHOULD BE ON THE SAME BLOODY PAGE. IT-------- SEEMS THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE FACING THE GOLD BUSINESS TODAY, IS THAT-------- INVESTORS HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE VALUE OF GOLD REALLY IS. WHO CAN BLAME-------- THEM? AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF SPIN, THE FACTS HAVE OBVIOUSLY BECOME TWISTED-------- AND DISTORTED, RENDERING THE TRUTH FAR, FAR AWAY. END.----------------- A PROPOSITION FOR MY READERS---------------- IN CONCLUSION, I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH THE WAY THIS OVERLY LENGTHY---------- REPORT WAS PRESENTED. THE FIRST 40 PAGES OR SO CONTAIN SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS----------, WHILE THE REST OF THE REPORT (160 PAGES) DETAILS THE----- "EXTENSIVE-----" RESEARCH---------- PUT INTO THESE CONCLUSIONS. OF COURSE, I AM FAR TOO POLITE TO SUGGEST---------- THAT WAS THE ORDER IN WHICH THE REPORT WAS ACTUALLY WRITTEN. MY BET---------- IS THAT ONLY A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF PASSIONATELY INTERESTED PARTIES---------- WILL GO BEYOND THE ASSERTIONS MADE IN THE FIRST 40 PAGES. DO YOU GET---------- THE PICTURE?-------------- SO, HERE IS THE DEAL. BEING-ONE OF THESE PASSIONATELY INTERESTED PARTIES--------, I WILL OMIT THE CONCLUSIONS AND STUDY THE----- "EXTENSIVE-----" RESEARCH-------- IN THE LAST 160 PAGES OF-THE REPORT THIS FALL, AND BEFORE THE ELECTION--------! I WILL THEN WRITE MY OWN CONCLUSIONS BASED ON DR. JECKYLL'S ANALYSIS--------, AND I WILL THEN COMPARE MY CONCLUSIONS TO THE EXPERT CONCLUSIONS DRAWN-------- BY THE ESTEEMED----- "DR.-----" I WILL TRY NOT TO MAKE IT A LENGTHY TREATISE-------- AND WILL ONLY PUBLISH IT IF I GET ENOUGH EMAIL REQUESTS TO DO SO.-------------- THUS, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ANALYSIS, PLEASE------------------------------------ EMAIL---------- ME---- AND NOTE WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE THE REPORT MAILED TO YOUR ADDRESS---------- OR SIMPLY EMAILED TO YOU.
