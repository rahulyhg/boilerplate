THE UTILIZATION OF PRINTING RESOURCES, AS WELL AS OVERALL PRINTING- ENVIRONMENT ADMINISTRATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS CAN BE OPTIMIZED. THE NEED FOR THE- VARIOUS ADDITIONAL PLATFORM-SPECIFIC PRINTING SOFTWARE COMPONENTS MAY BE- SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED.-------- UNICORN PRINT SERVER HAS A SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE. NO MATTER HOW BIG IS THE PRINTING- ENVIRONMENT, THE APPROPRIATE SERVER CONFIGURATION CAN BE PROVIDED. THE PRINTING- SOLUTION CAN BE EASILY UPGRADED--WHILE THE PRINTING ENVIRONMENT GROWS AND THE NEED TO- SUPPORT ADDITIONAL HOSTS, PRINTERS AND APPLICATIONS ARISES. UNICORN PRINT SERVER IS- OPTIMIZED FOR MISSION-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS, PROVIDING AN ADEQUATE PERFORMANCE FOR- LARGE ENTERPRISES. ON THE OTHER HAND, FOR SMALLER ENTERPRISES, THE MONEY-SAVING LOW-END SOLUTIONS MAY BE PROVIDED.-------- UNICORN PRINT SERVER IS OPTIMIZED TO CREATE CUSTOMER-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS. FOR EVERY- PARTICULAR CUSTOMER, THE SPECIAL SOLUTION CAN BE CREATED FROM THE SELECTED SET OF- STANDARD SERVER COMPONENTS. COMPONENTS MAY BE CONFIGURED TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS.- WHEN SOME CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS CAN NOT BE SATISFIED USING THE EXISTING MODULES-, ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER-SPECIFIC COMPONENTS CAN BE DEVELOPED AND EASILY INTEGRATED USING- THE SERVER OPEN ARCHITECTURE. THIS CAN DRAMATICALLY REDUCE TIME AND COSTS FOR THE- DEVELOPMENT OF HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED PRINTING SOLUTIONS.-------- UNICORN PRINT SERVER IS RUNNING ON (WINDOWS NT/2000) PLATFORM.- MOST OF CLIENT PLATFORMS AND PRINTING DEVICES ARE SUPPORTED.--------------------------------------- FEATURES------------- UNICORN PRINT SERVER SUPPORTS THE RICH SET OF FEATURES. THESE FEATURES ARE GROUPED INTO--FOLLOWING CATEGORIES:---------------- SPOOL MANAGEMENT----------- JOB MANAGEMENT----------- ADVANCED FEATURES----------- OPTIONAL FEATURES--------------- THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS CONTAIN MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THESE FEATURES.----------------------------------- SPOOL MANAGEMENT------------- SPOOL MANAGEMENT FEATURES PROVIDE THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PRINT SERVER. THESE- FEATURES INCLUDE:---------------- SPOOLING----------- JOB ATTRIBUTE HANDLING----------- LOGICAL AND PHYSICAL PRINTERS----------- PRINTER POOLING AND LOAD BALANCING----------- PRINTER STATUS MONITORING----------- INTELLIGENT JOB SCHEDULING----------- OPTIMIZED PERFORMANCE FOR MISSION-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS----------- CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF THE DISTRIBUTED PRINTING ENVIRONMENT--------------- AT THE VERY BASIC LEVEL, UNICORN PRINT SERVER IS A SPOOLING SYSTEM. ITS MAIN FUNCTION IS- TO DELIVER A DOCUMENT TO A SPECIFIED OUTPUT DEVICE ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT. THE CLIENT- SUBMITS THE DOCUMENT TO THE PRINT SERVER ALONG WITH THE SET OF DESIRED OUTPUT- PARAMETERS. FOR EACH INCOMING PRINT REQUEST THE-SERVER CREATES A SEPARATE PRINT JOB. ALL- PARAMETERS OF THE PRINT REQUEST ARE STORED AS JOB ATTRIBUTES. VARIOUS ATTRIBUTES DESCRIBE- ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRINT JOB, SUCH AS JOB IDENTIFICATION, JOB SCHEDULING-, PRINTER SELECTION, CURRENT-JOB STATUS AND DOCUMENT PRODUCTION INSTRUCTIONS.-------- THE PRINT SERVER SUPPORTS THE CONCEPT OF LOGICAL AND PHYSICAL PRINTERS. LOGICAL PRINTERS- REPRESENT INPUT QUEUES OF THE PRINT SERVER. WHEN A PRINT REQUEST IS SUBMITTED, THE NAME- OF A LOGICAL PRINTER SHOULD BE SPECIFIED. PHYSICAL PRINTERS CORRESPOND TO OUTPUT DEVICES- CONTROLLED BY THE PRINT SERVER. EACH PHYSICAL PRINTER REPRESENTS EITHER A PHYSICAL OUTPUT- DEVICE OR AN EXTERNAL DOCUMENT PROCESSING SOFTWARE COMPONENT (E.G., ARCHIVING OR- MAILING SOFTWARE).-------- THE FLEXIBLE WAY IS PROVIDED TO ESTABLISH-AND MANAGE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN LOGICAL AND- PHYSICAL PRINTERS. VARIOUS TYPES OF ASSOCIATIONS ARE POSSIBLE. FOR INSTANCE, ONE LOGICAL- PRINTER MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL PHYSICAL PRINTERS, THUS FORMING A PRINTER POOL.- FOR EACH JOB REQUESTING THAT LOGICAL PRINTER THE PRINT SERVER SELECTS AN ASSOCIATED- PHYSICAL PRINTER MOST SUITABLE TO RENDER THIS JOB. ON THE OTHER HAND, A GROUP OF LOGICAL- PRINTERS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME PHYSICAL PRINTER. IN THIS CASE, A SEPARATE SET- OF INITIAL ATTRIBUTE VALUES IS USUALLY ATTACHED TO EACH LOGICAL PRINTER IN A GROUP, AND JOBS- SUBMITTED TO DIFFERENT LOGICAL PRINTERS MAY RECEIVE DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTE VALUES.-------- PRINTER POOLING PROVIDES ADDITIONAL EFFICIENCY AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE PRINTING- PROCESS. USING THE PRINTER POOLING MECHANISM, SUCH IMPORTANT FEATURE AS LOAD- BALANCING IS IMPLEMENTED. WHEN MANY PRINT JOBS ARE SUBMITTED TO A PRINTER POOL, THE- PRINT SERVER TRIES TO DISTRIBUTE THEM BETWEEN PRINTERS TO PROVIDE THE BALANCED LOAD AND- THUS OPTIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN A JOB WITH THE CERTAIN- REQUIREMENTS IS SUBMITTED TO A PRINTER POOL, THE SERVER WILL SELECT THE PRINTER THAT IS- CAPABLE TO SATISFY THESE REQUIREMENTS. FOR INSTANCE, A PARTICULAR DOCUMENT MAY REQUIRE- CERTAIN PAPER MEDIA TO BE PROPERLY RENDERED. THE SERVER WILL SELECT A PRINTER THAT HAS- ALL REQUESTED MEDIA AVAILABLE. THUS, ALL JOBS SUBMITTED TO THE PRINTER POOL WILL BE- AUTOMATICALLY ROUTED TO VARIOUS PRINTERS DEPENDING ON JOB REQUIREMENTS AND PRINTER- CAPABILITIES. PRINTER POOLING CAN ALSO INCREASE THE STABILITY OF THE PRINTING ENVIRONMENT.- IF ANY PRINTERS THAT BELONG TO THE PRINTER POOL ARE TEMPORARY UNAVAILABLE DUE TO THE- HARDWARE FAULT OR TO THE SERVICING NEEDS, JOBS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY DIRECTED TO THE- PRINTERS THAT ARE STILL IN OPERATION. THE OPERATOR OF THE PRINT SERVER MAY RECONFIGURE- PRINTER POOLS DYNAMICALLY. IF NECESSARY, ADDITIONAL PRINTERS CAN BE INCLUDED IN PRINTER- POOLS.-------- THE PRINT SERVER PERFORMS MONITORING OF THE STATUS OF PRINTERS ATTACHED TO THE SYSTEM.- THE CURRENT STATE (E.G., IDLE, PRINTING, SHUTDOWN) OF EACH PRINTER IS CONTINUOUSLY- CHECKED, THUS IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF THE PRINTING PROCESS.-------- THE PRINT SERVER PERFORMS AN INTELLIGENT JOB SCHEDULING. THE ORDER IN WHICH JOBS ARE- PRINTED DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS. EACH JOB HAS THE CERTAIN SUBMISSION TIME AND MAY- HAVE THE CERTAIN PRIORITY ASSIGNED. BASICALLY, JOBS ARE SCHEDULED ACCORDING TO THEIR- PRIORITIES AND SUBMISSION TIME. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE TO ASSIGN THE SPECIAL HELD STATE- TO A JOB. IN THIS CASE THE JOB IS NOT SCHEDULED FOR PRINTING UNTIL IT IS MANUALLY RELEASED.- IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO ASSIGN THE CERTAIN PRINTING TIME TO A JOB. THE JOB IS HELD UNTIL THIS- TIME IS COMING, THEN THE JOB IS AUTOMATICALLY RELEASED. FINALLY, JOBS THAT BELONG TO A- CERTAIN GROUP MAY BE ASSIGNED THE SAME LABEL. THESE JOBS WILL BE NOT PRINTED UNTIL ANY- OF THE TARGET PHYSICAL PRINTERS WILL BE ASSIGNED THE SAME LABEL. THIS FEATURE ALLOWS THE- DYNAMIC CONTROL OVER THE SCHEDULING JOBS THAT BELONG TO DIFFERENT GROUPS.-------- AFTER THE JOB IS SUCCESSFULLY PRINTED, IT IS RETAINED DURING THE CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME.- THE JOB RETENTION PERIOD MAY VARY FOR DIFFERENT JOB CATEGORIES, MORE IMPORTANT JOBS- MAY BE RETAINED FOR LONGER TIME. RETAINED JOBS MAY BE REPRINTED ON DEMAND. WHEN THE- JOB RETENTION PERIOD IS EXPIRED, THE DOCUMENT SPOOL FILE IS DELETED TO FREE THE DISK- SPACE, BUT THE JOB ENTRY MAY BE KEPT FOR SOME MORE TIME TO ENABLE ACCOUNTING.-------- THE PRINT SERVER PERFORMANCE IS OPTIMIZED TO OBTAIN THE MAXIMUM THROUGHPUT FOR THE- MISSION-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS. NORMALLY, THOUSANDS PRINT JOBS CAN BE PROCESSED BY THE- SERVER WITHIN ONE HOUR, GIVEN THE SUFFICIENT PERFORMANCE OF THE PRINTING DEVICES.-------- ALL COMPONENTS OF THE PRINTING ENVIRONMENT CAN BE CONTROLLED FROM THE SINGLE CENTRAL- POINT. THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE IS PROVIDED THAT ALLOWS THE PRINT SERVER OPERATOR TO- VIEW AND MODIFY ATTRIBUTES OF ANY OBJECT THAT IS MANAGED BY THE SERVER (E.G., PRINT JOB-, DOCUMENT, PHYSICAL OR LOGICAL PRINTER). IF NECESSARY, THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE MAY- BE USED FROM THE REMOTE WORKSTATION.--------------------------------- JOB MANAGEMENT------------- JOB MANAGEMENT FEATURES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CONTROL OVER PROCESSING OF EACH- PARTICULAR PRINT JOB. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE:---------------- COMMON JOB CONTROL FUNCTIONS----------- JOB REPRINT, PRINTER REROUTING AND RANGE PRINTING----------- ANALYSIS OF THE DOCUMENT CONTENTS FOR PRINT REQUIREMENTS----------- ADVANCED SUPPORT FOR PRINTER-SPECIFIC FEATURES----------- SUPPORT FOR BANNER AND TRAILER PAGES--------------- THE PRINT SERVER IMPLEMENTS A SET OF COMMON JOB CONTROL FUNCTIONS. USING THE- GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE, THE OPERATOR CAN HOLD A JOB OR RELEASE A JOB THAT IS CURRENTLY- HELD. IF NECESSARY, PROCESSING OF ANY JOB MAY BE CANCELLED. DOCUMENT PRODUCTION- INSTRUCTIONS, LIKE COPY COUNT--SINGLE-SIDED OR DOUBLE-SIDED PRINTING, DEFAULT MEDIUM OR- DEFAULT INPUT TRAY, COLLATING, FINISHING AND COLOR SPECIFICATIONS MAY BE CHANGED AS WELL.-------- PRINT JOBS THAT HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY PRINTED ARE USUALLY RETAINED DURING THE CERTAIN- PERIOD OF TIME. IF NECESSARY, THE OPERATOR MAY REPRINT ANY RETAINED JOB. SOME JOB- ATTRIBUTES MAY BE CHANGED BEFORE REPRINTING. THE DESTINATION PRINTER MAY BE CHANGED-, THUS PROVIDING THE WAY FOR PRINTER REROUTING. IF NECESSARY, ONLY SOME SELECTED PAGES OF- THE DOCUMENT MAY BE REPRINTED.-------- THE PRINT SERVER IS CAPABLE TO ANALYZE THE DOCUMENT CONTENTS AND ASSIGN CERTAIN- ATTRIBUTES TO THE CORRESPONDING JOB BASED ON THE RESULTS OF SUCH ANALYSIS. FOR INSTANCE-, POSTSCRIPT DOCUMENTS THAT ARE CONFORMING TO DOCUMENT STRUCTURING CONVENTIONS- (DSC) ARE SCANNED FOR DSC COMMENTS THAT CONTAIN DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS. THESE- REQUIREMENTS ARE EXTRACTED AND ASSIGNED TO THE PRINT JOB AS VARIOUS JOB ATTRIBUTES. THE- PRINT SERVER ALSO SUPPORTS ANALYSIS OF-JOB TICKETS. JOB TICKET IS A SEQUENCE OF TEXT LINES- THAT DESCRIBE PRINT JOB REQUIREMENTS. USUALLY THE JOB TICKET IS INSERTED BY THE CLIENT- APPLICATION IN FRONT OF THE DOCUMENT CONTENTS. THE PRINT SERVER IS CAPABLE TO ANALYZE- JOB TICKETS AND EXTRACT THESE REQUIREMENTS. SINCE DIFFERENT VENDORS USE DIFFERENT- FORMATS FOR JOB TICKETS, THE FLEXIBLE METHOD IS PROVIDED TO DESCRIBE SUCH FORMATS AND TO- MAKE THEM KNOWN TO THE SERVER. SEVERAL WIDELY USED FORMATS (E.G., XEROX JOB TICKETS-) ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE STANDARD CONFIGURATION. THE PRINT SERVER ALSO DEFINES A NATIVE JOB- TICKET FORMAT, UNICORN JOB TICKETS. IN MORE GENERAL CASE, THE DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS- MAY BE CONTAINED INSIDE THE BODY OF THE DOCUMENT. THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY BE- EXTRACTED AND ASSIGNED TO THE JOB AS JOB ATTRIBUTES USING THE GENERIC CONTEXT ANALYSIS- ENGINE. THE FLEXIBLE METHOD TO DEFINE CUSTOMER-SPECIFIC CONTEXT RULES IS PROVIDED BY- THE SERVER.-------- THE PRINT SERVER PROVIDES AN ADVANCED SUPPORT FOR PRINTER-SPECIFIC FEATURES. GENERALLY-, THE PRINT SERVER HANDLES ALL DOCUMENT PRODUCTION INSTRUCTIONS IN THE DEVICE-INDEPENDENT WAY AS JOB ATTRIBUTES. WHEN THE DOCUMENT IS ABOUT TO BE TRANSMITTED TO- THE PRINTER, PRINTER-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ARE GENERATED AND INSERTED INTO THE OUTPUT- STREAM IN THE WAY THAT DEPENDS ON THE GIVEN PRINTER TYPE. THE PRINT SERVER MAY USE- VARIOUS METHODS TO IMPLEMENT PRINTER-SPECIFIC FEATURES. FOR POSTSCRIPT PRINTERS, THE- POSTSCRIPT CODE BASED ON ADOBE POSTSCRIPT PRINTER DESCRIPTION (PPD) FILES IS- GENERATED. FOR SOME PRINTER TYPES VENDOR-SPECIFIC JOB TICKETS ARE CREATED AND INSERTED- IN FRONT OF THE DOCUMENT CONTENTS.-------- SUPPORT FOR PRINTER-SPECIFIC FEATURES OFFERS SOLUTIONS FOR SEVERAL TYPES OF OUTPUT- MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS THAT OFTEN APPEAR IN THE VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTS. FOR INSTANCE-, WHEN PRINT JOBS ARE SUBMITTED BY TYPICAL WINDOWS APPLICATIONS, PRINTER DRIVERS- GENERATE THE PRINTER-SPECIFIC CODE THAT IMPLEMENTS REQUESTED FEATURES. ONCE THE PRINT- JOB IS CREATED, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REROUTE IT TO A PRINTER OF A DIFFERENT TYPE, BECAUSE THE- NEW PRINTER MAY INTERPRET INCORRECTLY THAT PRINTER-SPECIFIC CODE. ANOTHER PROBLEM- OCCURS IN TRADITIONAL MAINFRAME ENVIRONMENTS, WHEN SPOOLING SYSTEMS RUNNING ON THE--MAINFRAME HOSTS ARE NOT AWARE ABOUT THE ADVANCED FEATURES SUPPORTED BY THE PRINTING- DEVICES AND THEREFORE ARE NOT CAPABLE TO USE THESE FEATURES FOR RENDERING DOCUMENTS- GENERATED BY THE HOST APPLICATIONS. BOTH PROBLEMS CAN BE EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED BY -UNICORN PRINT SERVER SUPPORT FOR PRINTER-SPECIFIC FEATURES.-------- THE PRINT SERVER IS DESIGNED-TO SUPPORT PRINTERS OF VARIOUS VENDORS. THE FLEXIBLE WAY IS- PROVIDED TO DEFINE SPECIFIC DETAILS OF THE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL, AS WELL AS DEVICE- CAPABILITIES FOR EVERY PARTICULAR PRINTER TYPE.-------- THE PRINT SERVER CAN AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCE BANNER AND TRAILER PAGES THAT MAY BE- PRINTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE DOCUMENT. BANNER AND TRAILER PAGES ARE COMPOSED- DYNAMICALLY, BASED ON THE DEFINED SETS OF TEMPLATES. VALUES OF THE VARIOUS JOB- ATTRIBUTES THAT IDENTIFY THE JOB OR SPECIFY THE JOB CHARACTERISTICS MAY BE INSERTED INTO- BANNER AND TRAILER PAGES. TEMPLATES MAY BE CUSTOMIZED TO MATCH THE SPECIFIC NEEDS.-------------------------------------- ADVANCED FEATURES------------- ADVANCED FEATURES ARE DESIGNED TO ENABLE THE-CREATION OF POWERFUL ENTERPRISE OUTPUT- MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE:---------------- REMOTE AND DISTRIBUTED PRINTING----------- REARRANGEMENT OF THE DOCUMENT CONTENTS----------- INTEGRATION OF EXTERNAL FORMAT CONVERTERS----------- ACCOUNTING----------- BUILT-IN SCRIPTING ENGINE--------------- WHEN THE PRINTING ENVIRONMENT OF AN ENTERPRISE IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH SEVERAL- GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS, ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS ARISE. WHEN A DOCUMENT IS TRANSMITTED TO- A PRINTING DEVICE THAT IS INSTALLED AT THE REMOTE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION, DATA MAY BE LOST- OR CORRUPTED. THE PRINT OPERATORS WORKING AT BOTH TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING LOCATIONS- NEED ADEQUATE MEANS TO TRACK-ALL REMOTELY PRINTED JOBS AND TO CONTROL THE STATUS OF- SUCH JOBS IN THE RELIABLE WAY. TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, THE PRINT SERVER PROVIDES- FACILITIES SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE REMOTE AND DISTRIBUTED PRINTING. AT EACH REMOTE- LOCATION A SEPARATE INSTANCE OF A PRINT SERVER MAY BE INSTALLED. THUS THE NETWORK OF- PRINT SERVERS OPERATING TOGETHER IS CREATED. WHEN A PRINT SERVER INSTALLED AT ANY- LOCATION NEEDS-TO PRINT A JOB TO ANY REMOTE PRINTER, IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO TRANSMIT THE- JOB TO THIS PRINTER DIRECTLY. INSTEAD, THE JOB IS FIRST TRANSMITTED TO THE CORRESPONDING- REMOTE PRINT SERVER, WHICH TAKES CARE OF THE ACTUAL JOB DELIVERY. IN THIS-CASE THE JOB- MAY BE TRACKED BY BOTH SUBMITTING AND RECEIVING PRINT SERVERS. THIS METHOD ENFORCES- THE TRANSPARENT, CONTROLLABLE AND RELIABLE REMOTE DOCUMENT TRANSFER AND-PRINTING.-------- SOME APPLICATIONS MAY REQUIRE REARRANGEMENT-OF INFORMATION CONTAINED IN SOURCE- DOCUMENTS, BEFORE PRINTING. FOR INSTANCE, MANY BANKING PACKAGES GENERATE SOURCE- DOCUMENTS THAT CONTAIN INFORMATION RELATED TO MULTIPLE BANK CUSTOMERS, AND IT IS- DESIRED TO FETCH INFORMATION RELATED TO EACH PARTICULAR CUSTOMER FROM THE SOURCE SET OF- DOCUMENTS, IN ORDER TO FORM ONE SET OF OUTPUT DOCUMENTS FOR EACH CUSTOMER.-THE PRINT- SERVER PROVIDES COMPONENTS THAT SUPPORT THE DOCUMENT CONTENTS REARRANGEMENT.-------- BASICALLY, THE PRINT SERVER ITSELF HAS A LIMITED BUILT-IN SUPPORT FOR VARIOUS DOCUMENT- FORMATS. CURRENTLY IT-IS CAPABLE TO ANALYZE AND USE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF POSTSCRIPT- DOCUMENTS. OPTIONAL COMPONENTS ARE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT SOME ADDITIONAL FORMATS- (E.G., XEROX VIPP). IN ALL OTHER CASES THE PRINT SERVER RELIES EITHER ON THE ABILITY OF A- PRINTING DEVICE TO INTERPRET THE PARTICULAR DOCUMENT FORMAT OR ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE- THIRD PARTY FORMAT CONVERSION SOFTWARE. WHEN THE PRINTING DEVICE SUPPORTS THE- REQUESTED DOCUMENT FORMAT, THE DOCUMENT IS SIMPLY TRANSFERRED TO THAT DEVICE.- OTHERWISE THE EXTERNAL THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE COMPONENT THAT CONVERTS THE DOCUMENT- FORMAT TO ONE SUPPORTED BY THE TARGET PRINTER IS REQUIRED. EXTERNAL CONVERTERS MAY BE- INTEGRATED INTO THE PRINT SERVER ENVIRONMENT IN THE FLEXIBLE AND EFFICIENT WAY. IF THE- TARGET PRINTER DOES NOT SUPPORT THE GIVEN DOCUMENT FORMAT, THE SERVER SELECTS THE- SUITABLE EXTERNAL CONVERTER AND AUTOMATICALLY LAUNCHES IT TO PERFORM THE CONVERSION.- WHEN THE CONVERSION IS FINISHED,-THE RESULTING DOCUMENT IS RETURNED TO THE PRINT SERVER- FOR THE FINAL OUTPUT.-------- THE ACCOUNTING FEATURE IS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE REPORTS THAT CONTAIN STATISTICAL- INFORMATION DESCRIBING THE VOLUME PRINTED AND PRINTING RESOURCES CONSUMED DURING- THE GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME, GROUPED BY USERS AND/OR SPECIALLY DEFINED ACCOUNTING- PROFILES. USING THIS FEATURE, PRINTING COSTS RELATED TO EACH USER GROUP CAN BE CALCULATED.- THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY OF THE ENTERPRISE PRINTING PROCESS AND OF THE UTILIZATION OF- PRINTING RESOURCES CAN BE ESTIMATED AS WELL.-------- UNICORN PRINT SERVER IS DESIGNED AS THE OPEN, EXTENSIBLE SOFTWARE. THE EXTENSIBILITY- MECHANISM IS BASED ON THE SCRIPTING TECHNOLOGY. THE PRINT SERVER INCLUDES SIMPLE YET- POWERFUL EMBEDDED SCRIPTING LANGUAGE THAT PROVIDES ACCESS TO ALL OBJECTS OF THE-SERVER- OBJECT MODEL, LIKE PRINT JOBS, DOCUMENTS, LOGICAL AND PHYSICAL PRINTERS, THUS ENFORCING- THE OPEN ARCHITECTURE OF THE SERVER. THE SCRIPTING LANGUAGE IS BASED ON TCL (TOOL- COMMAND LANGUAGE). MOST OF THE-EXISTING PRINT SERVER COMPONENTS CAN BE CUSTOMIZED- USING SCRIPTS. SCRIPTING MAY BE ALSO USED FOR THE EFFICIENT CREATION OF ENTIRELY NEW PRINT- SERVER COMPONENTS THAT IMPLEMENT CUSTOM FEATURES NOT AVAILABLE OTHERWISE.------------------------------------- OPTIONAL FEATURES------------- OPTIONAL FEATURES ARE DESIGNED TO ENABLE THE EFFICIENT INTEGRATION OF THE PRINT SERVER- WITH CERTAIN VENDOR-SPECIFIC PLATFORMS AND TECHNOLOGIES. CURRENTLY THESE FEATURES- INCLUDE:---------------- ADVANCED SUPPORT FOR XEROX VIPP TECHNOLOGY----------- CLIENT SOFTWARE FOR OPEN VMS----------- CLIENT SOFTWARE FOR MICROSOFT WINDOWS--------------- THE PRINT SERVER PROVIDES AN EXTENSIVE SUPPORT FOR XEROX VIPP TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY BE- USED FOR TRADITIONAL HOST PRINTING AND LEGACY DOCUMENT FORMATS. THE PRINT SERVER- PERFORMS ALL VIPP FORMATTING AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, BASED ON THE DOCUMENT- REQUIREMENTS AND PRINTER CAPABILITIES.-------- FOR VIPP DOCUMENTS, THE PRINT SERVER CAN PERFORM EFFECTIVELY THE RESOURCE- MANAGEMENT. ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES (E.G., FONTS--FORMS AND IMAGES) MAY BE STORED IN- THE PRINT SERVER DATABASE IN THE CENTRALIZED WAY. THE SERVER PERFORMS THE ANALYSIS OF- THE DOCUMENT AND EXTRACTS RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS. DEPENDING ON THESE REQUIREMENTS- AND THE PRINTER CAPABILITIES, RESOURCES NEEDED TO RENDER EACH PARTICULAR JOB ARE INCLUDED--INTO THE OUTPUT STREAM AND TRANSMITTED TO THE TARGET PRINTER.-------- THE ENHANCED SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE FOR PRINT CLIENTS RUNNING UNDER OPEN VMS.- OPEN VMS NATIVE DOCUMENT FORMATS AND JOB SUBMISSION METHODS ARE SUPPORTED-, PROVIDING SEAMLESS INTEGRATION INTO THE STANDARD OPERATING SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT.-------- THE ENHANCED CLIENT SOFTWARE IS AVAILABLE FOR MICROSOFT WINDOWS. THIS SOFTWARE ACTS- AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE STANDARD WINDOWS SPOOLING SYSTEM. ONCE INSTALLED, THE- WINDOWS CLIENT SOFTWARE AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES AVAILABLE FOR ALL APPLICATIONS RUNNING- ON A CLIENT SYSTEM. THE WINDOWS CLIENT SOFTWARE ALLOWS A USER SUBMITTING A PRINT JOB- TO SPECIFY VALUES OF REQUIRED JOB ATTRIBUTES IN THE DEVICE-INDEPENDENT FORM, INSTEAD OF- SETTING THE VARIOUS PRINTER-SPECIFIC FEATURES REQUESTED BY EACH PRINTER DRIVER. THESE- ATTRIBUTE VALUES ARE TRANSMITTED TO THE PRINT-SERVER, WHICH IS COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE FOR- THEIR INTERPRETATION DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF THE TARGET PRINTER. THE CLIENT SOFTWARE FOR- WINDOWS CAN DRAMATICALLY REDUCE NUMBER OF VARIOUS PRINTER DRIVERS INSTALLED ON EACH- CLIENT SYSTEM, THUS REDUCING THE MAINTENANCE COST OF THE-DISTRIBUTED PRINTING--ENVIRONMENT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
