SECURITY: IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SECURITY----------------------------------------------------  BY-------------------------------- JON LASSER----, IN---------------------------------------- EDITORIALS---- - SAT, JAN 8TH 2000 23:-59 PDT------------------------------------  JON LASSER BEGAN THE BASTILLE LINUX PROJECT IN ORDER TO-HARDEN THE SECURITY OF RED HAT LINUX, THE DISTRIBUTION HE USES AT WORK.- IN THE PROCESS, HE BEGAN LOOKING AT THE OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS TO SEE HOW THEY HANDLE SECURITY UPDATES, AND HE WAS NOT AT ALL-HAPPY WITH WHAT HE FOUND.- IN TODAY'S EDITORIAL, HE SHARES HIS CONCERNS AND EXPLAINS WHY IT-MATTERS TO YOU EVEN IF YOU DO ALL YOUR SECURITY MONITORING FOR YOURSELF.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   COPYRIGHT NOTICE:---- ALL READER-CONTRIBUTED MATERIAL ON FRESHMEAT.NET----------- IS THE PROPERTY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF ITS AUTHOR; FOR REPRINT RIGHTS, PLEASE CONTACT THE AUTHOR---------- DIRECTLY.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   AS A PROFESSIONAL UNIX SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SYSTEM SECURITY. KEEPING UNAUTHORIZED USERS OFF MY SYSTEMS IS SIMPLY PART OF MY JOB; DOING THIS REQUIRES VIGILANCE IN THE FORM OF MONITORING PERFORMANCE, READING LOGS, AND KEEPING PATCHES UP-TO-DATE. FOR ME, SECURITY IS ABOUT SECURITY; IT'S ABOUT KEEPING MY USERS' PROJECTS SAFE AND KEEPING THEM COMFORTABLE DESPITE A FULL-TIME CONNECTION TO THE INTERNET.-------  AS LEAD COORDINATOR OF----------------------------------------- THE BASTILLE LINUX PROJECT----, A HARDENING SCRIPT FOR RED HAT LINUX, I THOUGHT MY JOB WAS TO MAKE LINUX MORE SECURE SO BEGINNING USERS COULD EASILY KEEP THEIR BOXES SECURE. OFTEN, NEW LINUX USERS HAVE NO EXPERIENCE AS SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS OR OFTEN EVEN ANY EXPERIENCE WITH UNIX. I THOUGHT THE BEST WAY TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM WAS TO MAKE IT EASY TO DO THE RIGHT THING.-------  RECENTLY, I'VE BEEN ASKED LOTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT LINUX SYSTEM SECURITY BY REPORTERS. OFTEN, I'M PUT ON THE DEFENSIVE RIGHT AWAY: DOES LINUX HAVE A SECURITY PROBLEM? WHY IS LINUX LESS SECURE THAN OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS? IS OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE INHERENTLY LESS SECURE THAN COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS?-------  I USUALLY BEGIN BY EXPLAINING THAT MORE HOLES ARE REPORTED IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE---- BEFORE----- THEY'RE EXPLOITED, AND THAT THE NUMBER OF ACTUALLY-EXPLOITED HOLES IS NO GREATER -- PERHAPS EVEN LESS -- THAN COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE. I EXPLAIN THAT ONE REASON THERE ARE SO MANY BREAK-INS INTO LINUX SYSTEMS IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY LINUX SYSTEMS ON THE INTERNET, AND I EXPLAIN THAT LINUX CAN BE AS SECURE AS ANY OTHER OPERATING SYSTEM.-------  BUT LINUX DOES HAVE A SECURITY PROBLEM. IT'S NOT A UNIVERSAL PROBLEM, BUT LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING LIST OF SECURITY WEB SITES, MAILING LISTS, AND UPDATE TOOLS FOR SOME COMMON LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS:-----------------  RED HAT LINUX--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  DEBIAN----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  SUSE-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  MANDRAKE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CALDERA----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  COREL------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TURBO LINUX-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  SLACKWARE LINUX-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THESE ARE ALL MAINSTREAM LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS, TENDING TOWARDS A GENERAL AUDIENCE; AT THE LEAST, THEY'RE NOT AIMING AT THE ROUTER MARKET OR THE EMBEDDED DEVICES MARKET. THESE ARE ALL PRODUCTS INTENDED TO BE USED BY NORMAL PEOPLE AND THROWN UP ON A CORPORATE NETWORK OR EVEN THE INTERNET. SOME MAY BE AIMED AT RELATIVELY EXPERT USERS, BUT I'M A FAIRLY ADVANCED USER MYSELF, AND I STILL EXPECT THAT MY SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTOR IS WATCHING OUT FOR SECURITY AT LEAST MINIMALLY. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I DON'T ROLL MY OWN DISTRIBUTION.--------  OF THE EIGHT COMMON DISTRIBUTIONS I COULD THINK OF, THREE HAVE NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH SECURITY, AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE OTHERS DIDN'T SEEM TO BE DOING ANYTHING USEFUL. NO WONDER LINUX HAS A SECURITY PROBLEM: WHILE THOSE FOUR DISTRIBUTIONS HAVE PROBABLY LESS THAN A QUARTER OF THE LINUX MARKET, THEY TEND TO BE HIGH-PROFILE DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH GARNER MORE THAN THEIR SHARE OF MEDIA COVERAGE.-------  THESE DISTRIBUTIONS AREN'T JUST PUTTING THEIR USERS AT RISK; THEY'RE DAMAGING LINUX'S CREDIBILITY AND ITS IMAGE IN THE MARKETPLACE. EVERY TIME I'M ASKED BY A REPORTER WHY LINUX IS SO INSECURE, I HAVE TO CONSIDER CALDERA, COREL, TURBO LINUX, AND SLACKWARE BEFORE I CAN ANSWER. THESE DISTRIBUTIONS' TOTAL LACK OF CONCERN WITH SECURITY IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE ENTIRE LINUX AND OPEN-SOURCE COMMUNITIES.-------  BECAUSE OF THESE DISTRIBUTIONS, I'M FORCED TO ADMIT TO REPORTERS THAT MANY LINUX INSTALLATIONS ARE INSECURE, AND THERE'S LITTLE THE AVERAGE USER CAN DO ABOUT IT WITHOUT DEDICATING AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME TO SECURITY WORK. MOST USERS AREN'T PAID TO WORRY ABOUT SECURITY, AS I AM. FOR MANY, COMPUTING MAY BE ONLY A SMALL PART OF THEIR WORK. THESE PEOPLE CAN'T RIGHTLY BE ASKED TO READ BUGTRAQ; THEY'VE GOT WORK TO DO.-------  IF ONLY SYSTEMS WERE KEPT UP TO PATCH, HUGE NUMBERS OF SYSTEMS WOULDN'T BE CRACKED. ON THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS WHERE I WORK--SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED USING THE AUTOMOUNT DAEMON BUG WHICH IS MORE THAN A YEAR OLD, AND WHICH HAS BEEN PATCHED NEARLY THAT LONG. BEING A PROFESSIONAL, I KNOW THAT THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE RUNNING IT, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT USING IT. BUT I CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO KNOW, AND I CAN'T EVEN FIX IT MYSELF: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE MACHINES EXISTED UNTIL I FOUND OUT THAT THEY'D BEEN HACKED. ASKING THESE USERS TO READ A SINGLE, LOW-VOLUME, VENDOR-SPECIFIC MAILING LIST IS A PRETTY GOOD SOLUTION -- WHEN THOSE LISTS EXIST.-------  EXPERIENCED USERS SHOULD ABANDON LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH DON'T PROVIDE SECURITY FIXES IN A TIMELY MANNER AND POST THAT INFORMATION TO A WEB SITE, A MAILING LIST, OR BOTH. THEY SHOULD ABANDON THESE DISTRIBUTIONS NOT BECAUSE THEY NECESSARILY NEED THE SECURITY NOTICES FOR THEMSELVES, BUT BECAUSE THESE DISTRIBUTIONS ARE RUINING LINUX'S IMAGE NOT ONLY WITH NOVICE USERS, BUT WITH THE REPORTERS AND EDITORS WHO SHAPE MANAGERS' OPINIONS ON WHETHER LINUX IS A VIABLE SOLUTION.-------  YOU MAY CLAIM THAT YOU'RE A HOBBYIST, AND YOU COULDN'T CARE LESS IF BUSINESSES USE LINUX; THAT'S YOUR RIGHT, CERTAINLY. HOWEVER, YOU LOSE NOTHING WHEN BUSINESSES USE LINUX, YOU LOSE NOTHING WHEN SECURITY UPDATES ARE MADE AVAILABLE AND PUBLICIZED, AND YOU GAIN NOTHING WHEN BUSINESSES REJECT LINUX BECAUSE SOME VENDOR COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO PACKAGE UP AN ALREADY PUBLICLY-AVAILABLE SOLUTION TO A SECURITY HOLE.-------  THE REST OF US DO LOSE.- IT HURTS OUR PROFESSIONAL REPUTATIONS WHEN WE STAND BEHIND A PIECE OF SOFTWARE WITH FREQUENT AND HIGHLY-PUBLICIZED SECURITY LAPSES.- IT WASTES OUR TIME, TRACKING DOWN HACKED USER MACHINES FOR WHICH WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE AND REBUILDING THEM FROM THE GROUND UP.- IT WASTES OUR MONEY, WHEN BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BUY MORE EXPENSIVE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE FOR THE ILLUSION OF SECURITY.-------  SOLVING THIS PROBLEM ISN'T DIFFICULT OR TIME CONSUMING; SIMPLY PICK DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH EXPRESS A BASIC LEVEL OF CONCERN FOR SECURITY ISSUES, AND LET VENDORS KNOW -- AT TRADE SHOWS, IN E-MAIL, IN LETTERS TO THE EDITOR OF YOUR FAVORITE PUBLICATION -- THAT SECURITY ISN'T JUST ABOUT SECURITY.- IT'S ABOUT PRESERVING OUR REPUTATION FOR QUALITY, AND IT'S ABOUT SAVING TIME AND MONEY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   JON LASSER---- IS A UNIX SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR, LEAD COORDINATOR FOR THE----------------------------------------- BASTILLE LINUX PROJECT----, AND AUTHOR OF A FORTHCOMING UNIX BOOK FROM------------------------------ MACMILLAN---- TENTATIVELY TITLED---- THINK UNIX-----.

I THINK SOME OF-THESE SLACKEWARE TYPES NEED TO STARTING DEALING WITH THEIR ANGER...--------  I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH RICHD'S PREMISE THAT EVERY UNIX USER MUST BE-RESPONSIBLE FOR UNDERSTANDING UNIX SECURITY. I'M A NEWER LINUX USER (LESS-THAN TWO YEARS), SO I DON'T HAVE THE SAME PERSPECTIVE AS THE OLD-TIMERS. I-DON'T SEE LINUX AS A HOBBYIST'S TOY, I SEE IT AS A TOOL THAT I'D LIKE TO BE-ABLE TO USE AT WORK (MUCH AS MR. LASSER WAS TALKING ABOUT). IN A LAN-SETTING, NOT EVERYONE IS A SYSADMIN, AND IN FACT, THAT COULD NEVER WORK.-PEOPLE CAN BE PERFECTLY PRODUCTIVE UNIX USERS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING-ANYTHING ABOUT INETD.CONF. I KNOW I WAS FOR YEARS.--------  FOR LINUX TO MAKE IT IN THE CORPORATE WORLD, THE BOXES NEED TO BE EASY-TO SET UP AS LAN WORKSTATIONS AND EASY TO KEEP UP TO DATE WITH SOFTWARE-PATCHES. ONE PERSON MUST BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN 10'S OR 100'S OF "SECURE-ENOUGH" LINUX BOXES. IN MY MIND THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL, AND TOOLS LIKE-AUTORPM AND BASTILLE LINUX ARE THE RIGHT APPROACH.--------  LINUX ADVOCATES TALK ABOUT DISPLACING WINDOWS, BUT IT WILL NEVER-HAPPEN UNTIL SECRATARIES AND CEOS CAN BE PRODUCTIVE ON LINUX, TOO. AND-BELIEVE ME, THEY BARELY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR ACCOUNT NAME IS.--------  WITH REGARDS TO DISTRO INSTALL SCRIPTS, ONE THING I FIND ANNOYING IS-THAT THE SCRIPTS (THE ONE'S I'VE USED, AT LEAST) ONLY RUN AT INSTALL TIME.-I THINK A BETTER WAY TO DO IT WOULD BE TO HAVE AN INSTALL SCRIPT THAT-DETECTED THE HARDWARE, INSTALLED THE KERNEL AND OTHER NON-OPTIONAL-PACKAGES, THEN REBOOTED INTO CONSOLE MODE. THEN, USE A GENERAL PURPOSE-TOOL (ONE THAT YOU COULD RUN AGAIN LATER) TO ENABLE AND DISABLE SERVICES-,AND INSTALL/UNINSTALL SOFTWARE. THAT WAY TURNING ON AND OFF SERVICES WOULD-NOT BE SUCH A BIG DEAL, SINCE THEY COULD EASILY TWEEKED LATER USING THE-SAME, EASY TO USE, VENDOR SPECIFIC TOOL.

I DON'T THINK IT'S THE-LATTER.-------  IN THE OLD DAYS (PRE 7.0, MAYBE ANOTHER LEVEL BACK BEYOND THAT OR SO, I-CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST VERSION I USED), SLACKWARE HAD---- HUGE------NUMBERS OF SECURITY HOLES. THEY JUST IGNORED THEM. AND THE SOURCES NEVER-SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THE BINARIES WHICH WERE INCLUDED -- SOMETIMES-IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE INCLUDED SOURCES WERE PRE-SLACKWARE-PATCHES, AS THE-COMPILER WOULD SPEW ERRORS. I CERTAINLY HOPE (AND TO SOME DEGREE EXPECT-)THAT THIS SITUATION'S BEEN CLEANED UP BY NOW, BUT THIS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE-TO AUDIT SLACKWARE'S SECURITY IF YOU WANTED TO.-------  BUT I'M REALLY CURIOUS AS TO WHY EVERYONE TOOK THIS AS AN ATTACK ON-SLACKWARE, SPECIFICALLY. IT CERTAINLY WASN'T INTENDED TO BE THAT. I-CERTAINLY THINK THAT SLACKWARE'S RECORD ON SECURITY COULD STAND-IMPROVEMENT -- I'M MORE IMPRESSED WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF FOUND AND FIXED-BUGS THAN AN APPARENT LACK OF THEM IN A FULL-FEATURED LINUX DISTRIBUTION--- BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IN THE ARTICLE, THIS ISN'T ABOUT ANY-PARTICULAR DISTRIBUTION.-------  WHAT IT IS ABOUT IS WHY SECURITY---- IS----- IMPORTANT, EVEN IF YOU-PERSONALLY CAN HANDLE YOURSELF. CLAIMING OTHERWISE IS KIND OF LIKE-CLAIMING THAT ISO9660 FILESYSTEM SUPPORT IN LINUX ISN'T WORTH KEEPING IN-THE KERNEL SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU PERSONALLY DON'T USE IT: IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL-,ENABLING FEATURE OF THE ENVIRONMENT FOR ANY NUMBER OF USERS.-------  IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LINUX'S IMAGE IN THE MEDIA, AND-SIMPLE THINGS WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THAT IMAGE. IF YOU PERSONALLY DON'T-CARE WHO BESIDES YOURSELF USES LINUX, THAT'S FINE. BUT I NEED LINUX TO-LOOK GOOD IN THE MEDIA, SO THAT I CAN PUSH FOR IT IN APPROPRIATE PROJECTS-AT WORK AND ELSEWHERE. ALSO, A GOOD IMAGE FOR LINUX IN THE MEDIA MAKES IT-MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR COMPANIES (IE CREATIVE LABS) TO WRITE OPEN-SOURCE-DRIVERS FOR HARDWARE WHICH IS NICE TO PLAY WITH. :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------)   SLACKWARE SECURITY------------------  BY---------------------- JIHAD---- - JAN 8TH 2000 13:32:-------------------01  IS IT JUST ME OR DOES THIS "PROFESSIONAL" NOT KNOW WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT?- IVE BEEN USING LINUX SINCE SLACK 3.2 AND IVE FOUND THAT SLACK IS THE MOST-SECURE DISTRO, WITH DEBIAN COMING IN SECOND AND REDHAT COMING IN SOMEWHERE-NEAR DEAD LAST, BEING THE HACKERS PARADISE OF BUFFER OVERFLOWS AND 'ENABLED-BY DEFAULT' SERVICES THAT IT IS.- AS FAR AS THE SECURITY/PATCHES/SUPPORT-GO, CHECK OUT SLACKWARE.COM AND SEE WHATS AT THE VERY TOP OF THE PAGE-,ALSO SLACKWARE.COM/LISTS.- WHILE JEFF DID MAKE SOME GOOD POINTS AND TOUCH-ON SOME ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED, HE SHOULD REALLY TAKE A CLOSER-LOOK AT THE ACTUAL OS NEXT TIME.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ALL PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ABLE TO DO...------------------  BY-------------------- STEPHEN SMOOGEN---- - JAN 8TH 2000 13:30:-----------------------12  IS DIS OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS VERSUS DISCUSS THE PROBLEM.

NOW I SEE A CENTRAL SITE AND PEOPLE FIND-THINGS RAPIDLY AND CLEANLY.--------  I USED TO USE SLACKWARE UP UNTIL 1996 WHEN I SWITCHED TO RED HAT BECAUSE I-WAS TIRED OF FINDING EXPLOITS AND THE SLACKWARE RESPONSE WAS "WELL PATCH IT-AND COMPILE IT FOR YOURSELF. WE WILL PUT OUT A FIX NEXT RELEASE"... WHICH-NEVER CAME. WHEN I FOUND THEM IN RED HAT, I SAW AN RPM AT A CENTRAL SPOT.------------  NOW IS RED HAT PERFECT?-------- NO---------. THERE ARE BUGS AND IT COULD-ALWAYS TIGHTEN THINGS UP HERE OR THERE. HOWEVER I KNOW EVERY TIME A CHANGE-IS MADE TO TIGHTEN SECURITY UP... THERE ARE HOWLS OF "WHY DID YOU CHANGE-THIS/THAT." THE SAME IS TRUE FOR SUSE, CALDERA, ETC. YOU GET SLAMMED NO-MATTER WHAT YOU DO BECAUSE A) PEOPLE HATE CHANGE, AND B) PEOPLE LIKE TO-WHINE VERSUS DEAL.--------  ANYWAY BACK TO THE MAIN POINT.. WHICH IS WHAT IS THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM-IS THAT LINUX IS NOT FOR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS ANYMORE---------!GASP---------!. SORRY MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE USING LINUX-PROBABLY KNOW ONLY ENOUGH SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION TO START A MODEM AND STOP-A MODEM... AND THAT MAY BE A STRETCH.- AND THAT IS WHAT YOU GET FOR HAVING-AN OPEN COMMUNITY AND SAYING THINGS LIKE "STOP USING MICROSOFT... USE-SOMETHING BETTER... ALSO WE ARE A COMMUNITY VERSUS AN ELITIST CLUB LIKE-XYZBSD, ETC.- (NOT SAYING BSD IS ELITIST, JUST A VERY COMMON ARGUMENT I-HEAR ABOUT WHY LINUX IS BETTER).--------  MOST PEOPLE USE COMPUTERS AS AN ENDS TO A MEANS AS JWZ SAID. THEY USE THEM-TO BROWSE WEB SITES, ANSWER EMAIL, WRITE DOCUMENTS AND LETTERS, SCAN-PICTURES IN FOR A FAMILY ALBUM. THE COMPUTER TO THEM IS NOTHING MORE THAN-A TOOL.. AS MUCH AS THE CAR GETS THEM TO AND FROM WORK.--------  WITH THIS BEING THE CASE, AND BEING THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A BETTER OS-AND A BETTER COMMUNITY... WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A BETTER-ATTITUDE TOWARDS SECURITY. I DONT FEEL BOYCOTTS ARE NEEDED. TOOLS THAT-HELP HOME USERS (NOT HOBBYISTS) GET WORKING WITH LINUX---------ARE--------- WHAT IS NEEDED.---------  ANYWAY MY 2 CENTS OF MANY.--  STEPHEN SMOOGEN-------------------- --  WHERE OH WHERE IS CARMEN SANDIAGO?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   NEEDED TO BE SAID.------------------  BY------------------- IDCMP---- - JAN 8TH 2000 13:03:-------------------20  DEFINING SECURITY WITHOUT USING THE WORD "SECURE" IS A TASK INTO ITSELF.- WE'VE ALL INSTALLED A LINUX DISTRIBUTION, AND WE'VE ALL GONE AND CLEANED-OUT INETD.CONF.- ALL OF US.- EVERYONE ONE OF US.- THINK ABOUT IT.-- HOW-MUCH TIME AND ENERGY IS WASTED TO CLEAN OUT INETD.CONF?- TO TURN OFF-PORTMAPPER?- TO DO ALL THE REST?--------  THIS ARTICLE DOESN'T COMPARE LINUX SECURITY T O MICROSOFT SECURITY, IT-COMPARES IT TO BEING ABSOLUTELY SECURED.- I'D LOVE TO HAVE A PRE-SECURED-LINUX BOX, AND THE WAY THIS NEW MARKET WORKS, IF THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE-LIKE ME OUT THERE, WE'LL FIND A DISTRIBUTION THAT DOES IT, AND SWITCH TO-IT.- OTHERS WILL SEE OUR CHOICE AND BEGIN TO FOLLOW SUIT.- BEING "SECURED-"AND REMAINING USEFUL AT THE SAME TIME IS A THIN LINE TO BALANCE ON.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   SECURITY------------------  BY----------------------- THE SHADOWELL---- - JAN 8TH 2000 12:13:-------------------54  I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN CONCEPTS THAT IS MISSED HERE IS THAT THE AVERAGE-,NON-EXPERT, TRYING LINUX BECAUSE THEY'RE TIRED OF MICROSOFT USER DOESN'T-WANT A SYSTEM THAT THEY HAVE TO DO ANY REAL CONFIGURATION ON.- THEY WANT-EVERYTHING TO WORK, EVEN IF THEY HAVE NO NEED AT ALL FOR THE SERVICE-THEY'RE RUNNING.- YOU'LL GET USERS DEMANDING-THAT THE FTP DAEMON WORK-,ONLY FOR YOU TO FIND OUT THAT THEY'RE LOGGING IN TO THE MACHINE FROM THE-SAME MACHINE, AND HAVE NO REAL NEED FOR IT-TO BE RUNNING AT ALL.- TELL-THEM THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO DISABLE IT, AND THEY'LL SAY THAT THEY-'MIGHT' NEED IT, AND WANT IT THERE.- CURRENT DISTROS DO SEEM TO HAVE-SERVER WRITTEN ALL OVER THEM, BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO BE THE-MARKET THEY'RE TRYING TO HIT LATELY.- SOME COMPANIES DON'T HAVE THE-RESOURCES TO RE-RELEASE THEIR SOFTWARE EVERY WEEK.- THERE ARE DEADLINS FOR-PRESSING THE CDS, WRITING THE MANUALS, TESTING THE SOFTWARE, ETC.., ETC.- IT'S NOT ALWAYS VERY PRACTICAL TO TRY TO INCLUDE THE LATEST FIX EVERY-OTHER DAY IN THE RELEASED DISTRO.- AS FOR SECURITY ADVISORIES, FOR CALDERA-GO TO HTTP://WWW.CALDERASYSTEMS.COM/SUPPORT/SECURITY-/ I LOVE IT WHEN-PEOPLE SAY THINGS DON'T EXIST...------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   COMMENTS------------------  BY---------------------------- TITO---- - JAN 8TH 2000 12:04:-------------------05  I HAVE TO AGREE WITH JWZ ON MONITORING FOR SECURITY PATCHES. THAT SHOULD BE-THE JOB OF THE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR(S). END USERS HAVE MORE IMPORTANT-THINGS TO DO (AS FAR AS THE COMPANY IS CONCERNED) THAN MONITORING PATCHES-FOR THEIR OS. IF THE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR-SECURITY ADVISORIES AND PATCHES, THEN MAYBE IT'S TIME TO FIND A NEW SYSTEM-ADMINISTRATOR. I AM NOT A SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR. I'M ONE OF THOSE GEEKS AT-THE COMPANY THAT BRINGS IN MONEY ON CONTRACTS. I HAVE ENOUGH THINGS TO DO-AT WORK THAT I DON'T NEED THE ADDED BURDEN OF DUPLICATING THE WORK OF MY-COMPANY'S SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS (NO MATTER HOW BAD THEY MAY BE).--------  THAT BEING SAID, I ALSO HAVE TO AGREE WITH NICKO ACKS IN THAT LINUX-DISTROBUTIONS TURN TOO MANY SERVICES ON BY DEFAULT. HEAVEN FORBID SOMEONE-SHOULD TAKE THE BETTER ROUTE AND LEAVE EVERYTHING OFF TO BEGIN WITH (LIKE-OPENBSD) AND THEN LET THE SYSTEM ADMININSTRATOR TURN ON ONLY THE SERVICES-HE NEEDS.---------  HAVING MANY DISTROS MAY BE A PLUS, IN SOME WAYS, BUT IT'S ALSO A-DEFINITE MINUS TOO, CONSIDERING THAT THE (POTENTIAL) USER NEEDS TO-CONSIDER THE PROS AND CONS OF EACH (OR JUST RUN OUT AND BUY THE NEWEST-VERSION OF RED HAT LIKE MOST PEOPLE THESE DAYS :P).

COMPUTERS DON'T GET HACKED, PEOPLE DO. IF-ADMINS ARE STUPID AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO SECURE AN OS, THEN CERTAIN PEOPLE-WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM AND THEIR COMPUTERS. SECOND, REDHAT IS BAD.-EVERYTIME A NEW VERSION OF REDHAT COMES OUT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO-REMOTE EXPLOITS FOR THE PREVIOUS VERSION.

PEOPLE BEFORE ME ADD-COMMENT ON THE MAILING LIST, AND THE REPOSITORY OF PATCH. YOU CAN NOTICE-THERE ARE FEW PATCHES, IT'S BECAUSE PATRICK VOLKERDING HAS ALWAYS TAKE-CARE OF SECURITY IN HIS DISTRIBUTION OF LINUX BEFORE RELEASING IT. THERE-ARE ALSO LESS PACKAGES THAN OTHER ONES BUT I SLEEP BETTER.--------  YOUR ARTICLE IS INTERESTING, BUT I HAVE THE IMPRESSION YOU ONLY TELL-OBVIOUSNESS : YES, OF COURSE, USERS CONCERN BY SECURITY HAVE TO LOOK FOR-TOOLS (MAILING LIST WEB PAGE, ETC ...)

YOU SIMPLY WANT TO BE-DICTATOR, CHOOSING FOR EVERYBODY THE GOOD WAY...----- AN ANOTHER POINT TO ANSWER TO JWZ, IF YOU CAN'T SPEND HALF AN A HOUR-PER DAY FOR SECURITY ISSUES, SECURITY IS DEFINITELY NOT A CONCERN FOR YOU-,SORRY. I'M A BIT CURIOUS, WHAT IS YOUR MODEL OF SECURITY OS ? WINDOWS ? SO-YOU NEVER HAD A LOOK ON SECURITYFOCUS (AND OTHERS).---  I-CAN'T SEE HOW WE CAN-HAVE SECURITY ACTUALLY WITHOUT-SPEND TIME FOR-IT.---  THE POWER OF LINUX IS IN DISTRIBUTIONS, EVERYONE CAN FIND HIS "GOOD-"DISTRIBUTION, SO LET THE PEOPLE OF DISTRIBUTIONS WORKS, HELP THEM, ASK-THEM FOR NEW FEATURES, BUT DON'T BAN THEM.
