MOST OF THE PAPERS YOU WRITE WILL INVOLVE REFLECTION ON WRITTEN TEXTS-- THE THINKING AND RESEARCH THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE ON YOUR-SUBJECT. IN ORDER TO-WRITE YOUR OWN ANALYSIS OF THIS SUBJECT, YOU WILL NEED TO DO CAREFUL CRITICAL READING-OF SOURCES AND TO USE THEM CRITICALLY TO MAKE YOUR OWN ARGUMENT.- THE JUDGMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS YOU MAKE OF THE TEXTS YOU READ ARE THE FIRST STEPS TOWARDS FORMULATING YOUR OWN APPROACH.---------------------------- CRITICAL READING: WHAT IS IT?------------ TO READ CRITICALLY IS TO MAKE JUDGEMENTS ABOUT--- HOW---- A TEXT IS ARGUED. THIS IS A HIGHLY REFLECTIVE SKILL REQUIRING YOU TO "STAND BACK" AND GAIN SOME-DISTANCE FROM THE TEXT YOU ARE READING.-(YOU MIGHT HAVE TO READ A TEXT THROUGH ONCE TO GET A BASIC GRASP OF CONTENT BEFORE YOU LAUNCH INTO AN INTENSIVE CRITICAL READING.)-THE KEY IS THIS:---------------------- DON'T READ LOOKING ONLY OR PRIMARILY FOR--- INFORMATION------------------ DO READ LOOKING FOR--- WAYS OF THINKING---- ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER---------------------- WHEN YOU ARE READING, HIGHLIGHTING, OR TAKING NOTES, AVOID EXTRACTING AND COMPILING LISTS OF EVIDENCE, LISTS OF FACTS AND EXAMPLES.--AVOID APPROACHING A TEXT BY-ASKING "WHAT INFORMATION CAN I GET OUT OF IT?-" RATHER ASK "HOW DOES THIS TEXT WORK?- HOW IS IT ARGUED? HOW IS THE EVIDENCE (THE FACTS, EXAMPLES, ETC.) USED AND INTERPRETED?- HOW DOES THE TEXT REACH ITS CONCLUSIONS?---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW DO I READ LOOKING FOR WAYS OF THINKING?----------------------- FIRST DETERMINE THE--- CENTRAL CLAIMS---- OR--- PURPOSE---- OF THE TEXT (ITS THESIS). A CRITICAL READING ATTEMPTS TO ASSESS HOW THESE CENTRAL CLAIMS ARE DEVELOPED OR ARGUED.-------------- BEGIN TO MAKE SOME JUDGEMENTS ABOUT--- CONTEXT---- . WHAT AUDIENCE IS THE TEXT WRITTEN FOR? WHO IS IT IN DIALOGUE WITH?- (THIS WILL PROBABLY BE OTHER SCHOLARS OR AUTHORS WITH DIFFERING VIEWPOINTS.-) IN WHAT HISTORICAL CONTEXT IS IT WRITTEN?- ALL THESE MATTERS OF CONTEXT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR ASSESSMENT OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN A TEXT.-------------- DISTINGUISH THE--- KINDS OF REASONING---- THE TEXT EMPLOYS. WHAT CONCEPTS ARE DEFINED AND USED?- DOES THE TEXT APPEAL TO A THEORY OR THEORIES? IS ANY SPECIFIC METHODOLOGY LAID OUT?- IF THERE IS AN APPEAL TO A PARTICULAR CONCEPT,-THEORY, OR-METHOD, HOW IS THAT CONCEPT, THEORY, OR METHOD THEN USED TO ORGANIZE AND INTERPRET THE DATA?- YOU MIGHT ALSO EXAMINE HOW THE TEXT IS ORGANIZED: HOW HAS THE AUTHOR ANALYZED (BROKEN DOWN) THE-MATERIAL?- BE AWARE THAT DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES (I.E. HISTORY, SOCIOLOGY,-PHILOSOPHY, BIOLOGY) WILL HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF ARGUING.-------------- EXAMINE THE--- EVIDENCE---- (THE SUPPORTING FACTS, EXAMPLES, ETC) THE TEXT EMPLOYS.--SUPPORTING EVIDENCE IS INDISPENSABLE TO AN ARGUMENT.- HAVING WORKED THROUGH STEPS 1-3, YOU ARE NOW IN A POSITION TO GRASP HOW THE EVIDENCE IS USED TO DEVELOP THE-ARGUMENT AND ITS CONTROLLING CLAIMS AND CONCEPTS.- STEPS 1-3 ALLOW YOU TO SEE EVIDENCE IN ITS CONTEXT.- CONSIDER THE KINDS OF EVIDENCE THAT ARE USED.- WHAT COUNTS AS EVIDENCE IN THIS ARGUMENT? IS THE EVIDENCE STATISTICAL?-LITERARY? HISTORICAL? ETC.- FROM WHAT SOURCES IS THE EVIDENCE TAKEN?- ARE THESE SOURCES PRIMARY OR SECONDARY?-------------- CRITICAL READING MAY INVOLVE--- EVALUATION----. YOUR READING OF A TEXT IS ALREADY CRITICAL IF IT ACCOUNTS FOR AND MAKES A SERIES OF JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW A TEXT IS ARGUED.- HOWEVER, SOME ESSAYS MAY ALSO REQUIRE YOU TO ASSESS THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF AN ARGUMENT.- IF THE ARGUMENT IS STRONG, WHY?- COULD IT BE BETTER OR DIFFERENTLY SUPPORTED?- ARE THERE GAPS, LEAPS, OR INCONSISTENCIES IN THE ARGUMENT? IS THE METHOD OF ANALYSIS PROBLEMATIC?--COULD THE EVIDENCE BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY?- ARE THE CONCLUSIONS WARRANTED BY THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED? WHAT ARE THE UNARGUED ASSUMPTIONS?- ARE THEY PROBLEMATIC?- WHAT MIGHT AN OPPOSING ARGUMENT BE?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SOME PRACTICAL TIPS----------------------- CRITICAL READING OCCURS AFTER SOME PRELIMINARY PROCESSES OF READING.- BEGIN BY-SKIMMING RESEARCH MATERIALS, ESPECIALLY INTRODUCTIONS AND CONCLUSIONS, IN ORDER TO STRATEGICALLY CHOOSE WHERE TO FOCUS YOUR CRITICAL EFFORTS.-------------- WHEN HIGHLIGHTING A TEXT OR TAKING-NOTES FROM IT, TEACH-YOURSELF TO HIGHLIGHT-ARGUMENT: THOSE PLACES IN A TEXT WHERE AN AUTHOR EXPLAINS HER ANALYTICAL MOVES, THE CONCEPTS SHE USES, HOW SHE USES THEM, HOW SHE ARRIVES AT CONCLUSIONS.- DON'T LET YOURSELF FOREGROUND AND ISOLATE FACTS AND EXAMPLES, NO MATTER HOW INTERESTING THEY MAY BE.- FIRST, LOOK FOR THE LARGE PATTERNS THAT GIVE PURPOSE, ORDER, AND MEANING TO THOSE EXAMPLES.- THE OPENING SENTENCES OF PARAGRAPHS CAN BE IMPORTANT TO THIS TASK.-------------- WHEN YOU BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT USE A PORTION OF A TEXT IN THE ARGUMENT YOU ARE FORGING IN YOUR OWN PAPER, TRY TO REMAIN AWARE OF HOW THIS PORTION FITS INTO THE WHOLE ARGUMENT FROM WHICH IT IS TAKEN. -PAYING ATTENTION TO CONTEXT IS A FUNDAMENTAL CRITICAL MOVE.-------------- WHEN YOU QUOTE DIRECTLY FROM A SOURCE, USE THE QUOTATION CRITICALLY.- THIS MEANS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SUBSTITUTE THE QUOTATION FOR YOUR OWN ARTICULATION OF A POINT.- RATHER, INTRODUCE THE QUOTATION BY LAYING OUT THE JUDGMENTS YOU ARE MAKING ABOUT IT, AND THE REASONS WHY YOU ARE USING IT.- OFTEN A QUOTATION IS FOLLOWED BY SOME FURTHER ANALYSIS.-------------- CRITICAL READING SKILLS ARE ALSO CRITICAL LISTENING SKILLS.- IN YOUR LECTURES, LISTEN NOT ONLY FOR INFORMATION BUT ALSO FOR WAYS OF THINKING (SEE THE HEALTH SCIENCES WRITING CENTRE'S LINK ON----------------------------------------------------- MAKING NOTES FROM LECTURES----). YOUR INSTRUCTOR WILL OFTEN EXPLICATE AND MODEL WAYS OF THINKING APPROPRIATE TO A DISCIPLINE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WRITTEN BY DEBORAH KNOTT, NEW COLLEGE WRITING CENTRE. ----COPYRIGHT------ ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  SITE CREDITS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LAST MODIFIED------------- JULY 9,------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2005 HOME------------------------ | FAQS------------------------ | NEWS---- | WRITING COURSES----------------------- | WRITING CENTRES------------------------------------ ADVICE--------------------------- | BOOKS--------------------------- | FOR FACULTY---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
