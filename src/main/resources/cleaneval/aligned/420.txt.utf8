WEAVER, WAS REMARKABLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FEATURE FILMS OF----- ITS TIME BECAUSE OF ITS NON-HOLLYWOODISH REFLECTION OF DAILY LIFE. [A RECORD----- OF SORTS, IT WAS THE--- FIRST---- US FEATURE FILM TO SHOW A BATHROOM WITH----- A TOILET BOWL.-----------------------------] WITH A NOVICE ACTOR (JAMES MURRAY) IN THE LEAD ROLE, THE FILM----- WAS SIMPLY A REALISTIC, BITTERSWEET DRAMA OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN ORDINARY----- COMMON AND AVERAGE AMERICAN (AN EVERYMAN PROTOTYPE EMBODIED-IN A WHITE-COLLAR----- WORKER) TRYING TO MAKE IT WITH HIS-WIFE IN THE MONOLITHIC BIG CITY - BUT WITHOUT----- ANY MAUDLIN-SENTIMENTALITY, EXTREME PASSION, EXPLOITATION OF ROMANCE, OR ESCAPIST----- MELODRAMA. REALITY INTRUDES AS HE EXPERIENCES CRAMPED LIVING CONDITIONS, A----- BORING JOB, AND A LIMITED LIFE WITH REGRET AND BITTERNESS, RATHER THAN WHAT----- HE HAD EXPECTED.---------------------------------- VIDOR'S NATURAL AND UNCOMPROMISING FILM TELLS THE EPISODIC, POIGNANT STORY----- OF THE WORKING AND DOMESTIC LIFE OF AN AVERAGE, COMMONPLACE MAN IN 'THE CROWD'----- - JOHN - WITH HIS WIFE MARY (PLAYED EXQUISITELY BY THE DIRECTOR'S REAL-LIFE----- WIFE), CHRONICLING THEIR MEETING, COURTSHIP, MARRIAGE, AND FAMILY LIFE. THE----- DIRECTOR ALSO CAST A VIRTUAL UNKNOWN NEWCOMER TO THE ROLE OF THE HUSBAND IN----- HIS CANDID VIEW OF THE AVERAGE MAN - A CHARACTER LOST IN THE MIDST OF THE----- FACELESS MASSES. THE FILM'S DIRECTOR REFUSED TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THE HARSH----- REALITIES OF LIFE FOR THE WORKADAY COUPLE, EITHER BY CONDEMNING OR CELEBRATING----- THE GLOOM OF THE BLEAK TRAGEDY BEFALLING THEM. INSTEAD, HE VISUALLY AND ELOQUENTLY----- CAPTURED THEIR BELIEVABLE HUMAN STRUGGLE AS THEY LIVED THEIR UNIDEALIZED LIVES -----AND CONFRONTED DISAPPOINTING SETBACKS, THE TRAGIC DEATH OF THEIR DAUGHTER-----, DASHED HOPES AND BRIEF TRIUMPHS, AND EVENTUALLY FOUND COMFORT IN THE ANONYMITY----- OF THE MASSES, WATCHING AN UNFUNNY THEATRICAL CLOWN ACT.------- TO CAPTURE THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE CITY, THE DIRECTOR SOMETIMES USED A 'HIDDEN----- CAMERA' IN HIS ON-LOCATION SHOOTS IN NEW YORK. STYLISTICALLY, THE FILM, IN----- VARIOUS PLACES, RESEMBLES THE GERMAN EXPRESSIONIST FILMS OF F. W. MURNAU AND----- FRITZ LANG, ALTHOUGH IT ALSO USES FLUID AND NATURAL CAMERA MOVEMENTS. KING----- VIDOR RECEIVED AN ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATION AS BEST DIRECTOR, AND THE FILM----- ITSELF WAS NOMINATED AS BEST-UNIQUE AND ARTISTIC PICTURE IN A SHORT-LIVED----- AWARD CATEGORY. SIX YEARS LATER, VIDOR INDEPENDENTLY PRODUCED AND DIRECTED----- A 'TALKIE' SEQUEL TO--- THE CROWD---- (INTENDED AS PART OF A FILM TRILOGY-----) TITLED--- OUR DAILY BREAD (1934)---- - IT WAS A DEPRESSION-ERA, HARD-TIMES------SOCIAL DRAMA ABOUT AN IDEALISTIC MAN WHO WAS-RUNNING A FARM COOPERATIVE ORGANIZED----- AS A SOCIALISTIC SOCIETY - IN THE COUNTRY AWAY FROM THE CROWD.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE FILM'S OPENING TITLE HERALDS THE CELEBRATION OF JULY 4TH IN AN ANONYMOUS----- TOWN IN THE YEAR 1900:---------------------- THE NATION ON HOLIDAY! FIREWORKS! PARADES--PICNICS! CELEBRATING----- AMERICA'S 124TH BIRTHDAY! - BUT WHAT WAS A LITTLE THING LIKE THE DECLARATION----- OF INDEPENDENCE COMPARED TO THE GREAT EVENT HAPPENING IN THE SIMS HOUSEHOLD?--------------------IN AN UPSTAIRS BEDROOM WHERE A MIDWIFE AND FAMILY DOCTOR ATTEND THE HERO'S----- BIRTH - A STARTLINGLY-REALISTIC SCENE - THE DOCTOR LIFTS (FEET-FIRST) A NAKED----- BABY BOY FROM ITS MOTHER'S BED AND SLAPS IT TWICE ON ITS BOTTOM. THE INFANT----- IS WRAPPED IN A BLANKET AND BROUGHT-TO THE ARMS OF ITS PROUD, ELATED FATHER:---------------------- THERE'S-A LITTLE MAN THE WORLD-IS GOING TO HEAR FROM ALL RIGHT-------DOCTOR.

HALLELUJAH--------! NERDY-LOOKING BOY: I PURPOSE TO SEEK OCCUPATION AS A COWBOY.-------- WHITE BOY: HOW 'BOUT YOU, JOHNNY SIMS?-------- JOHNNY: (ME?) MY DAD SAYS--- I'M---- GOIN' TO BE SOMEBODY BIG-------------------! A HORSE-DRAWN WHITE AMBULANCE WAGON PULLS UP IN FRONT OF THE SIMS HOUSE-----, BRINGING AN ABRUPT CATASTROPHE TO THE BOY'S YOUTH:---------------------- JIMMINY CRICKETS! IT'S STOPPIN' AT YOUR HOUSE, JOHNNY-------------------! AN INQUISITIVE CROWD GATHERS OUTSIDE AS MEN CARRY A STRETCHER UP TO THE----- SECOND FLOOR. TO ACCENTUATE THE CLAUSTROPHOBIC, NARROW CORRIDOR OF THE HOME'S----- STAIRCASE, THE CAMERA IS PLACED IN A FIXED POSITION AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS----- FOR THE SUSTAINED SHOT. NO LONGER CONFIDENT, JOHNNY IS A TINY FIGURE IN THE----- LONG, TAPERING CONFINES OF THE BOXY ENTRYWAY WITH WALLS THAT STRETCH AWAY----- - HE IS PAINFULLY OVERWHELMED BY THE FUNNELLING VOID OF HIS FAMILIAR FLIGHT----- OF STAIRS. HE LEAVES THE PEOPLE CROWDED AND HUDDLED AT THE DOORWAY AND TENTATIVELY----- STARTS THE LONG CLIMB UP THE STEEP STEPS TO THE TOP - TO HIS QUESTIONABLE----- FUTURE. AT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY UP, HE PAUSES - A FEMALE RELATIVE FROM----- ABOVE COMES DOWN TO HIM, CRADLES HIM, AND TELLS THE NEWLY-ORPHANED BOY OF----- HIS FATHER'S PREMATURE DEATH:---------------------- YOU MUST BE BRAVE NOW, LITTLE MAN...LIKE YOUR FATHER WOULD WANT----- YOU TO BE.------------------- "WHEN JOHN WAS TWENTY-ONE HE BECAME ONE OF THE SEVEN MILLION THAT BELIEVE----- NEW YORK DEPENDS ON THEM." TO BRAVELY FACE HIS FUTURE, CLAIM HIS BIRTHRIGHT----- AND SEEK THE DREAM HIS FATHER ALWAYS WANTED FOR HIM, 21 YEAR OLD JOHN RIDES----- THE FERRY TO NEW YORK (MANHATTAN) WITH HIS NAME-LABELED SUITCASE UNDER HIS------ARM - AT THE FERRY RAILING WHILE LOOKING AT THE SKYLINE, A GAUNT PASSENGER----- CYNICALLY AND OMINOUSLY WARNS THE NAIVE YET AMBITIOUS YOUNG MAN OF THE DEPERSONALIZED----- METROPOLIS AND THE MYTH OF ADVANCEMENT THERE:---------------------- PASSENGER: YOU'VE GOTTA BE GOOD IN THAT TOWN IF YOU WANT TO BEAT----- THE CROWD.-------- JOHNNY: MAYBE...BUT ALL I WANT IS AN OPPORTUNITY.------------------- IN HIS SOBERING SEARCH FOR FAME AND FORTUNE, JOHN IS IMMEDIATELY SUBMERGED----- IN THE NEW CAPITALISTIC, UNCARING ENVIRONMENT - WITH ITS MASSIVE CONFUSION----- AND OVERPOWERING SIZE. THE MONTAGE OF THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF THE CITY SYMBOLIZES------HOW ENGULFED, SURROUNDED, ISOLATED-AND INSIGNIFICANT HE-IS - EVERYTHING IS----- SHOT FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW. [HIGH SKYSCRAPERS AND TRAFFIC IN A BUSTLING-----, CROWDED CITY WAS A NOVELTY IN 1928.] FROM A HIGH ANGLE, CROWDS OF SCURRYING----- PEDESTRIANS CROSS THE CITY BLOCK AT W 45TH. CARS AND BUS TRAFFIC OVERWHELM----- THE THOROUGHFARE. AN ENDLESS MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE, CARS, VEHICLES, AND ELEVATED----- TRAINS SPEED BY. SMOKESTACKS SPEW PLUMES OF WHITE SMOKE FROM SKYSCRAPER TOPS----- AND FROM TUGBOATS IN THE HARBOR. THE CAMERA MOVES FURTHER AND FURTHER BACK----- TO ENCOMPASS THE EXHILARATING SCOPE AND VASTNESS OF THE CITY, FILLED WITH----- BEEHIVES OF WORKERS. THEN, AIMED AT THE TOP OF A TALL OFFICE BUILDING, IT----- ROTATES IN A DIZZYING CLOCKWISE TURN.------- ONE OF THE GREATEST IMPRESSIONISTIC TRACKING SHOTS IN ALL OF CINEMATIC HISTORY----- BEGINS AT THE STREET LEVEL. THE MAJESTIC SHOT TILTS UPWARD AND SMOOTHLY TRAVELS----- UP THE FLAT OUTSIDE SURFACE OF A STONE WALL OF A MULTI-WINDOWED SKYSCRAPER----- - ONE OF MANY IN THE CITY. SUDDENLY, THE OFFICE BUILDING RISES AND STRAIGHTENS----- UP OUTSIDE ONE FLOOR, AND TRANSPORTS THE VIEWER DIRECTLY INTO ONE OF ITS WINDOWS.----- IN A DISSOLVE, THE CAMERA SLIDES THROUGH THE WINDOW INTO A LARGE ROOM FILLED----- WITH A MONOTONOUS CRISS-CROSSING OF HUNDREDS OF ROWS OF IDENTICAL OFFICE DESKS----- AND WORKERS. THE CAMERA SWEEPS ACROSS THE INFINITE SEA OF ANONYMOUS, BUSINESS-ATTIRED----- INSURANCE COMPANY PAPER-PUSHERS UNTIL IT ZOOMS IN ON OUR HERO - ONE OF MANY----- WAGE-SLAVES SEATED AMIDST HUNDREDS OF OTHER OBEDIENT AND COWED CLERKS. ANOTHER----- FACELESS VICTIM OF THE CITY, JOHN SIMS' (JAMES MURRAY) DESK IS LABELED (IN----- CLOSEUP): "JOHN SIMS 137." [IN----------------------- THE APARTMENT (-------------1960), DIRECTOR BILLY WILDER PAID HOMAGE TO THIS IMAGE OF A SEA OF DESKS FOR ANONYMOUS----- WORKERS.-------] HE HAS IN HIS HAND A TORN NEWSPAPER AD WITH AN OFFER FOR "ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS----- CASH PRIZE" IF HE CAN WIN THE PRODUCT-NAMING CONTEST FOR THE SYLVANIAN OIL----- COMPANY IN NEW YORK: "GIVE US A NAME FOR OUR NEW MOTOR FUEL." A FEW OF HIS----- CLEVER, INVENTIVE IDEAS ARE 'PETROL-PEP' AND 'JAZZ-O-LENE.' IMPATIENTLY, HE----- WATCHES THE WALL CLOCK - IT IS A FEW MINUTES BEFORE 5 PM. HIS LIFE'S COMINGS----- AND GOINGS ARE DICTATED BY THE GIANT TIME-PIECE. WHEN THE MINUTE HAND MOVES----- TO 5, THE AUTOMATON WORKERS LEAP UP AND-SCURRY AWAY FROM THEIR DESKS FOR THE----- EXIT AND SWARM THROUGH OFFICE DOORS. IN THE WASHROOM, THE LIKEABLE YOUNG OFFICE----- WORKER FRESHENS UP AND COMBS HIS HAIR, AND IS AGGRAVATED WHEN TOLD IDENTICAL----- THINGS BY FOUR DIFFERENT COLLEAGUES: "WASHIN' 'EM UP, SIMS?", "TAKIN' A WASH-----, SIMS?", "SCRUBBIN' 'EM UP, SIMS?", AND "CHASIN' THE DIRT, SIMS?----------------------" YOU BIRDS HAVE BEEN WORKING HERE SO LONG THAT YOU ALL TALK ALIKE-------------------!

JOHN...JANE! MARY...JOHN! JOHN...MARY!...COME ON, ROMEO-----! SAVE SOMETHING FOR THE MOONLIGHT-------------------! TO ESCAPE THE CONFINES OF THE CITY, THEY RIDE ON THE TOP OF A DOUBLE-DECKER----- BUS, TAKING THE SPIRALING ACCESSWAY UP THE BACK OF THE BUS TO GET THERE (WITH----- A FEW TASTELESS GAGS ABOUT PEERING UP THEIR DATES' DRESSES).

AND I BET HIS FATHER THOUGHT HE WOULD BE PRESIDENT-------------------! JOHN IS WELL-SUITED FOR HIS DATE, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP BEGINS ON A POSITIVE----- NOTE. THE FOURSOME REACH THE CONEY ISLAND AMUSEMENT PARK WHERE THEY JOYOUSLY----- RIDE THE ROLLER COASTER, THE BARREL ROLL, THE SPINNING WHEEL, THE SLIDE, THE----- MERRY-GO-ROUND, AND THE DARK TUNNEL OF LOVE - WHERE THE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO----- MAKE ROMANTIC MOVES ON THEIR DATES:---------------------- JANE: (TO BERT) SAY, AM I-RIDIN' WITH YOU...OR-WRESTLIN'?--------- MARY: (AFTER JOHN OVERWHELMS HER WITH MANY KISSES) GEE...I OUGHTN'T TO LET----- YOU KISS ME.------------------- ON THE CROWDED SUBWAY RIDE HOME, BERT HASN'T FARED WELL WITH JANE, BUT MARY----- IS SLEEPILY CURLED UP IN JOHN'S ARMS. A SUBWAY ADVERTISEMENT FOR A FURNITURE----- COMPANY IN NEWARK, N.J. SPARKS AN IDEA IN JOHN'S HEAD: "YOU FURNISH THE GIRL----- - WE'LL FURNISH THE HOME----------------------!" MARY, LET'S YOU AND ME GET MARRIED. (SHE WAKES UP AND STARES BACK----- AT HIM.)------------------- THE NEXT SCENE OPENS WITH A FADE-IN ON A PAN DOWN A RAILROAD SIGN FOR "THE----- NIAGARA," A SPECIAL TRAIN WHICH DEPARTS AT 8:30 PM FOR THE DESTINATIONS OF:----- "POUGHKEEPSIE, HUDSON, ALBANY, SCHNECTADY, UTICA, SYRACUSE, ROCHESTER, BUFFALO-----, NIAGARA FALLS."
