THE SIDES ARE MADE OF A SOFT AND FLEXIBLE-MESH MATERIAL. YOUR BABY MIGHT NOT EVEN WAKE UP IF SHE ROLLED-INTO THE SIDE OF IT.-MEG------------------------------ MONTH OLD STANDING IN CRIB, EXHAUSTED---------- JULY--------- 2002 MY DAUGHTER-IS STANDING AT NAPTIME AND BEDTIME, EVEN WHEN- UTTERLY EXHAUSTED. SHE IS SOMETIMES HAPPILY STANDING- HOLDING THE RAIL--BUT THIS SOON BECOMES SCREAMING HER HEAD- OFF. IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT IT'S THAT INNATE URGE TO GET TO VERTICAL- WHICH HAS CONTROL OVER HER. WE DON'T DO WELL CO-SLEEPING, SO- THAT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION. BUT IT'D BE NICE TO HEAR FROM FOLKS- WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS. SHE IS A SPIRITED PHYSICAL GIRL- WHO-IS KEENLY ATTENTIVE TO EVERY SOUND AND VISUAL STIMULI (I.E.- IT'S-NEVER BEEN TOO EASY TO GET HER TO BED IN THE FIRST PLACE.-) WHEN SHE IS WALKING AROUND HOLDING OUR HANDS OR ONTO- FURNITURE, SHE IS ABLE TO SIT HERSELF DOWN WELL WITHOUT FALLING.- AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, SHE APPEARS TO BE IN ANOTHER SPURT OF- TEETHING. HELP! HELP-!MADELEINE---------  MY HUSBAND AND I EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING WITH OUR DAUGHTER- STARTING WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS OLD.- SHE WAS NORNALLY- A GREAT SLEEPER.- OUR SITUATION SEEMED IDENTICAL TO YOURS: WE DO- NOT CO-SLEEP WITH HER.- THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS ADJUSTED HER- SCHEDULE OF NAPPING, SO THAT THERE WAS MORE TIME BETWEEN NAPS.-- WE FOUND THAT BEING CONSISTANT AND STICKING TO OUR ROUTINE HAS- HELPED A LOT.- WHEN WE PUT HER DOWN, WE GO THROUGH OUR LITTLE- ROUTINE AND WE LAY HER DOWN IN HER CRIB AND LEAVE THE ROOM.-- AFTER FIVE MINUTES, IF SHE IS CRYING (AND USUALLY STANDING UP-) WE CHECK ON HER AND LAY HER BACK DOWN, RUB HER HEAD A COUPLE- TIMES, BUT DO NOT SAY ANYTHING AND DO NOT PICK HER UP OR HOLD- HER.- SHE WOULD USUALLY GET BACK UP AND CRY. WE WAIT LONGER- (7-10 MINUTES) BEFORE WE GO IN AND LAY HER BACK DOWN.- WE REPEAT- THE PROCESS AND EXTEND THE TIME BETWEEN GOING IN THE ROOM.- THE- FIRST WEEK WAS HARD.- IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR JUST TO GET- HER TO SLEEP.- WE ARE FIRST TIME PARENTS AND SHE IS NOT A FUSSY- BABY, SO HEARING HER CRY JUST BROKE OUR HEARTS.-- IT HAS TAKEN- ABOUT A MONTH BUT NOW WHEN WE PUT HER DOWN, IF SHE GETS UP AND- CRIES, WE USUALLY HAVE TO LAY HER BACK DOWN ONCE AND SHE FALLS- ASLEEP.- I HOPE THIS HELPS.- IT HAS REALLY HELPED US A LOT.-AMY----  OH BOY, I REMEMBER THIS ALL TOO WELL.- LET ME SEE, WHERE TO- BEGIN?- WELL, MY DAUGHTER WHO IS NOW 12 IS AND WAS THE SAME-, SPIRITED, INTELLIGENT, COMMANDING AND DEMANDING-! AND I GAVE IN- EVERY TIME.- WHY?- BECAUSE I DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE ''BOOKS''- ADVICE THAT IF YOU JUST IGNORE IT THE INFANT/TODDLER WILL STOP -AND JUST GO TO SLEEP ON THEIR OWN AFTER SAY A WEEK.. I ACTUALLY- TESTED THIS OUT, AT 3 MONTHS, AT 6, 9, 1 YEAR, 3, YEARS, 5 YEARS-, 8 YEARS.- PERHAPS YOU ARE WONDERING IF I HAD INCOMPLETER- BOUNDARIES OR A SOFT HEART.- YES TO A SOFT HEART, I LOVE MY CHILD- MORE THAN MYSELF BUT I-DESPERATELY WANTED SLEEP.- I CAN NOT BEGIN- TO LIST ALL THE NIGHT LIGHTS, SNUGGLES, BOOK READING, VAMPIRE- SALTS, ETC. WE WENT THROUGH-! NONE WORKED FOR US.- I RECOMEND- READING ''RAISNG YOUR SPIRITED CHILD'' RIGHT AWAY, IT WAS A GREAT- HELP TO ME TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE LOT'S OF CHILDREN OUT THERE WHO- HAVE THIS TEMPERANT AND VIEWED IN THE RIGHT WAY, IT IS A GIFT TO- THE HOLDER OF THE PERSONALITY.- MY DAUGHTER AND I WERE ABLE TO- SLEEP BY ME GETTING A QUEEN SIZE BED AND I SLEPT THERE WITH HER- IN HER ROOM FOR 10 YEARS-! I TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE, INCLUDING AT- 5 TRYING TO LOCK HER IN HER ROOM OUT OF DESPERATION TO SLEEP WITH- MY HUSBAND WHO WAS ADMANTLY AGAINST CO SLEEPING.- SHE IS STILL- INTENSE AND KEENLY AWARE AND ALWAYS WILL BE.- THIS POSES CERTAIN- HUGE HURDLES OF GROWTH ON MY PART BUT I SEE HER BLOSSOMING INTO A--CREATIVE, VIBRANT, SELF SUFFICENT YOUNG TEEN.- ARTISTIC AND- CARING. I WOULDN'T TRADE HER FOR ANYTHING-!!I THINK YOU GOT THE BEST OF THE BUNCH, JUST GIVE IN TO THE- DEMANDS OF THE PERSONALITY, AFTER ALL THIS IS WHY WE ARE MOTHERS-, NO MATTER HOW HARD AND BELIEVE ME, THERE WERE MANY NIGHTS WHEN I- SAT BY HER BED AND CRIED MYSELF TO SLEEP BEFORE I GOT THE--MATTERESS.-MSCWALKER----  WHAT WE DID WAS PRACTICE GETTING FROM A STANDING TO A SITTING- POSITION THROUGH PLAY. -I WOULD HOLD MY BABY'S HANDS AND PULL- HER UP SAYING ''BABY UP'', THEN I'D LOWER HER ONTO HER LITTLE- BOOTY SAYING ''BABY DOWN''.- WE STARTED-WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT 4--MONTHS OLD, BUT I'M SURE YOU CAN DO IT WITH AN 8-MONTH OLD.- I- DID THIS SPECIFICALLY SO THAT SHE-WOULDN'T GET STUCK IN A- STANDING POSITION IN-HER CRIB AT NIGHT AND CAUSING PROBLEMS WITH- HER PUTTING HERSELF BACK TO SLEEP.- FORTUNATELY, I READ- A ''GETTING YOUR BABY TO SLEEP'' BOOK THAT ALERTED ME TO THE- PROBLEM BEFORE IT BEGAN.-CHRISTINA-----  THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN MY SON WAS EXHAUSTED AND- RESISTING SLEEP, SO I PUT HIM IN THE CRIB TO FALL ASLEEP---ALTHOUGH IT UPSET HIM (AND ME).- THE NICE THING ABOUT A CRIB--IS THAT IT'S DESIGNED TO BE SAFE.- HE FELL ASLEEP STANDING UP-, LEANING ON THE BARS, MORE THAN ONCE, AFTER CRYING FOR A WHILE.-- WHEN HE FELL DOWN, HE DID NOT HURT HIMSELF, AND IT ONLY- AWAKENED HIM SLIGHTLY--THEN HE WENT BACK TO A DEEPER SLEEP- (I WATCHED HIM DO THIS ONCE).- OTHER TIMES HE WAS PRACTICALLY- ASLEEP STANDING UP (AFTER CRYING FOR A WHILE), AND DID NOT GET- UP AGAIN WHEN WE LAY HIM DOWN.- MY SON HAS GONE THROUGH- SEVERAL DIFFERENT STAGES IN HIS FALLING-ASLEEP HABITS, SOME OF- THEM-QUITE BRIEF, SO DON'T DESPAIR-! HE IS NOW 18 MONTHS OLD-, AND RARELY COMPLAINS WHEN-PUT TO BED, TIRED BUT AWAKE, FOR A- DAYTIME NAP OR A NIGHT'S SLEEP.- AND IN OUR CASE IT WAS -CERTAINLY TRUE THAT THE FIRST 2 OR 3 TIMES OF CRYING TO SLEEP WERE- THE MOST PAINFUL FOR ALL PARTIES.- AFTER THAT, WHEN WE HAD TO DO- IT (HE WAS FREQUENTLY ASLEEP WHEN PUT INTO BED, I ADMIT), HE- OFTEN ONLY-CRIED FOR 5 OR 10 MINUTES (OFTEN INTERMITTENTLY).-- SINCE YOUR DAUGHTER IS EASILY DISTURBED BY NOISES, YOU MIGHT- WANT TO TRY USING SOME SOOTHING MUSIC THAT WILL MASK- NOISES FROM OUTSIDE HER ROOM (YOUR FOOTSTEPS, ETC.), THAT- MIGHT KEEP HER FROM RELAXING INTO SLEEP, AT BEDTIME--START IT- BEFORE YOU LEAVE, AND LEAVE IT PLAYING WHEN YOU GO.- WE HAVE- BEEN USING THE SAME MUSIC FOR MANY MONTHS AS PART OF THE- BEDTIME ROUTINE, AND I STARTED USING IT FOR NAPTIME, TOO, MORE- RECENTLY--IT'S DEFINITELY HELPFUL.- AND IF THE TEETHING IS KEEPING- HER FROM SLEEPING, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY-TYLENOL, IN THE- DOSAGE RECOMMENDED BY YOUR PEDIATRICIAN, ON NIGHTS WHEN- IT'S REALLY BOTHERING HER.- I WAS WORRIED (ABOUT STARTING A- HABIT, I GUESS) THE FIRST TIME I DID THIS, BUT FOUND THAT I ONLY- ENDED UP USING IT A FEW TIMES.-LISA----  WE WORKED WITH A VERY INTUITIVE BABY COACH ...--SEE--------------------------- SLEEP CONSULTANTS---- FOR THE-REST OF THIS RECOMMENDATION.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
