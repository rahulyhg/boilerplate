BOX----------------------------------------------------------------------- 874 PITTSBORO, NC--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27312 WHAT'S YOUR REASON FOR RELAY?----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EACH ONE OF US- HAS OUR OWN PERSONAL REASONS TO RELAY, WHETHER IT BE A FAMILY MEMBER, FRIEND OR- EVEN OURSELVES WHO HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. BUT WE ALL RELAY TOWARD THE- SAME OUTCOME. HOPE DRIVES US ALL, AND WE DERIVE OUR INSPIRATION FROM THE STORIES- AND FAITH OF OTHERS.----- "BECAUSE OF YOU... LIVES ARE SAVED, LIVES ARE CHANGED.-----" THE- REASON WHY I RELAY IS TO PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF MY UNCLE WALLACE CAMPBELL, TO- HONOR MY MOTHER, MYRTLE PAKE, FOR HER BATTLE AND SURVIVAL OF BREAST CANCER AND- MY FATHER, DENNIS PAKE, WHO HAS HAD MELANOMA. I ALSO RELAY FOR YOU SO THAT- HOPEFULLY YOU WILL NOT EVER HEAR THOSE TERRIBLE WORDS  YOU HAVE CANCER . I RELAY- TO RAISE FUNDS FOR RESEARCH, ADVOCACY AND PATIENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS. I LOVE- FIGHTING FOR A CURE FOR CANCER, BRINGING HOPE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE AMERICAN- CANCER SOCIETY IS AT WORK IN COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY PROVIDING- PROGRAMS AIMED AT REDUCING THE RISK OF CANCER, DETECTING CANCER AS EARLY AS- POSSIBLE, ENSURING PROPER TREATMENT, AND EMPOWERING PEOPLE FACING CANCER TO COPE- AND MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE QUALITY OF LIFE. I AM EXTREMELY PASSIONATE- ABOUT RELAY AND SEEING THIS FIGHT TO THE END. I JOINED THE STAFF OF THE AMERICAN- CANCER SOCIETY IN DECEMBER 2004 AND WILL HAPPILY LOSE THE JOB OF MY DREAMS- BECAUSE OF THE ULTIMATE GOAL: FINDING A CURE FOR CANCER. WITH GOD AS OUR MAIN- SUPPORTER AND EACH ONE OF US, ONE DAY SOON THE DREADED  C--WORD  CANCER  WILL BE- JUST ANOTHER WORD IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS.---------- WE ALL HAVE OUR STORIES. WHAT IS YOURS?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHARLOTTE KING, AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I M OFTEN ASKED- WHY I AM SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THE RELAY FOR LIFE.------ PEOPLE WONDER, IS IT--BECAUSE I VE HAD CANCER MYSELF OR THAT I VE LOST A LOVED ONE TO THE AWFUL- DISEASE?------ I RELAY BECAUSE I KNOW IT COULD BE ME SOMEDAY.------ WE ARE ALL- SURROUNDED BY CANCER EVERY DAY.------ WE CAN T GET AWAY FROM IT.------ I LOST A- COUSIN THIS PAST WEEK TO LUNG CANCER.------ HE WAS 45 YEARS OLD AND A SINGLE- DAD.------ THE WIFE OF ONE OF MY CO-WORKERS WAS DIAGNOSED A MONTH AGO WITH COLON- CANCER.------ SHE IS 35 YEARS OLD AND HAS TWO SMALL CHILDREN.------ THESE AREN T- BAD PEOPLE.------ THEY HAVEN T ABUSED THEIR BODIES.------ THEY RE PEOPLE JUST- LIKE ME.------ I AM THANKFUL EVERY DAY THAT I HAVE THE HEALTH AND STRENGTH TO DO- SOMETHING TO HELP FIND A CURE.------ I M GRATEFUL THAT I LIVE IN-A COMMUNITY--WHERE PEOPLE CARE AND ARE WILLING TO SPEND SOME OF THEIR PRECIOUS FREE TIME--VOLUNTEERING TO RAISE MONEY AND RAISE AWARENESS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CAROL ESAU, COMMITTEE CO-CHAIR--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ON AUGUST 11, 1997, I EXPERIENCED THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE- (OR SO I THOUGHT). MY 7 YEAR OLD SON CHRISTOPHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH- NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TO- OTHER PEOPLE. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS HAPPENING TO----- "MY-----" CHILD. I FOUND OUT- THEN, AND MANY TIMES SINCE, THAT IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE. AS IT TURNS OUT, MAY- 10, 2001 WAS THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE. AFTER A 4 YEAR COURAGEOUS BATTLE, MY------ "BABY-----" LOST HIS BATTLE WITH THAT DREADED DISEASE.--------------------------------- WITH CHRISTOPHER AS MY INSPIRATION, I----- "RELAY-----" SO THAT SOME- DAY, OTHER CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS DO NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THE HORRIBLE- DISEASE OF CANCER AND WHAT IT DOES TO YOU PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. I DON'T- WANT ANY CHILD TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT MY SON WENT THROUGH AND I DON'T WANT- ANY PARENT TO HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THE LOSS OF A CHILD.--------------------------------- FOR ME, PARTICIPATING IN THE RELAY FOR LIFE HELPS TO MAKE- SOMETHING POSITIVE OUT OF SOMETHING SO VERY NEGATIVE. I AM CONFIDENT SOME DAY- THERE WILL BE A CURE FOR CANCER, AND I WILL HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING- THAT I PLAYED A VERY SMALL PART IN IT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CLAIRE WILSON, COMMITTEE CO-CHAIR--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I SPENT MY 26TH BIRTHDAY (OCTOBER) IN ASHEVILLE- WITH MY DAD AND HIS NEW WIFE.------ IT WAS THEN THAT MY DAD DECIDED TO TELL ME- SOMETHING THAT WOULD FOREVER CHANGE MY LIFE.------ HE HAD ALWAYS COMPLAINED OF- GALL STONES, SO DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO HAVE THEM REMOVED.------ HE'D HAD HIS- SURGERY THE WEEK BEFORE.------ COME TO FIND OUT IT WASN'T GALL STONES HE HAD- BEEN COMPLAINING OF FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS, IT WAS INTESTINAL CANCER.------ THE- DOCTORS DID AN OPEN/CLOSE PROCEDURE FOR A BIOPSY TO DETERMINE WHAT ALL WAS- INVOLVED.------ EVERYTHING...THE CANCER WAS TOUCHING ALMOST EVERY PART OF HIM.------- FOR THE NEXT 6 WEEKS, I WOULD TRAVEL FROM RALEIGH TO ASHEVILLE EVERY FRIDAY- THROUGH SUNDAY AND SPEND EVERY PRECIOUS MOMENT WITH MY FATHER.------ WE CAME TO- UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER AND EXPRESS OUR LOVE, SUPPORT, FAITH AND BEING SO PROUD OF- EACH OTHER.------ WITH GOD BESIDE HIM DURING THE NIGHT, MY FATHER PASSED AWAY- DECEMBER 4,------------ ONLY 6 WEEKS AFTER THEY DIAGNOSED HIM WITH CANCER.------- WE HAD JUST CELEBRATED HIS 56TH BIRTHDAY THE NIGHT BEFORE, WITH EACH OF HIS- THREE CHILDREN THERE.------------------------------------------- MY DAD WASN'T ALIVE FOR SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF MY- LIFE..HE NEVER MET MY HUSBAND, NOR WAS HE THERE FOR MY WEDDING OR THE BIRTH OF- MY DAUGHTER.------ I DO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS WITH ME THROUGH IT ALL.------ I FEEL THAT I AM- GIVING SOMETHING BACK TO MY FATHER BY DOING THE RELAY.------ IT MAKES ME FEEL WORTH- WHILE AND I KNOW THAT HE WOULD BE SO PROUD.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- STEPHANIE MASON, SPONSORSHIP------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ IN THE FALL OF 1979, A MAN WAS TOLD HE HAD A- TUMOR.------ A TUMOR, NOT CANCER------!

HE LOVED HIS #1 BABY.------ A SOFT, STUFFED LITTLE GREEN AND- WHITE RABBIT.------ HE LOVED HIS FAMILY AND HIS BABY SISTER.------ THAT BABY BOY TURNED- INTO A LITTLE MAN AND ON AUGUST 11, 1997, WHICH HAPPENED TO BE HIS GRANDMOTHER S- BIRTHDAY, HE------ WAS TREATED FOR STREP THROAT AND ENLARGED LYMPH NODES.------ STREP- THROAT, NOT CANCER------! HE WAS SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS OLD. ------AND ON MAY- 10, 2001, THIS LITTLE BOY DIED FROM THIS DREADED DISEASE CALLED CANCER------!! THIS BRAVE- AND COURAGEOUS LITTLE BOY WAS MY GREAT-NEPHEW. THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE- HAPPENED.----------- THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN TO ANY CHILD OR ADULT.------------------------------------------- MANY OTHER FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN- DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, SOME ARE SURVIVORS AND OTHERS- HAVE LOST THEIR BATTLE WITH CANCER.------ IT IS TIME TO COME TOGETHER AND DO WHATEVER- IT TAKES TO FIND A CURE FOR THIS THING CALLED CANCER------!! WHY DO I RELAY?------ I HOPE- THAT MY SMALL PART WILL HELP TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE REST OF MY FAMILY AND THE- MANY, MANY FRIENDS THAT I HAVE.------ GOD BLESS EVERYONE WHO RELAYS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!!! WANDRA FARRELL, RELAY COMMITTEE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I DON T KNOW OF ANYONE WHO HAS NOT BEEN AFFECTED- BY CANCER IN SOME WAY .WHETHER IT S BATTLING THIS HORRIBLE DISEASE PERSONALLY OR- WATCHING A LOVED ONE SUFFER.------------ IN OCTOBER--980, AFTER NUMEROUS TESTS, X-RAYS-, AND FINALLY EXPLORATORY SURGERY, MY MOTHER S DOCTORS DISCOVERED THAT-SHE HAD- PANCREATIC CANCER.------ FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THEY GAVE US NO HOPE AND DID NOT- EVEN RECOMMEND TREATMENT.------ MY FAMILY HAD NEVER HAD ANYTHING TO  ROCK OUR WORLD-  AS THIS DID, AND BEING IN TOTAL DENIAL WE REFUSED TO ACCEPT HER FATE.------ AN- ONCOLOGIST FINALLY AGREED TO TRY CHEMOTHERAPY BUT AFTER ONLY TWO TREATMENTS-, MOTHER WAS TOO WEAK TO GO THROUGH ANYMORE.------ AFTER SUFFERING FOR SIX MONTHS, SHE- PASSED AWAY APRIL 17,------ TO THIS DAY I HAVEN T FORGOTTEN WHAT SHE WENT- THROUGH AND THE FEELING OF TOTAL HELPLESSNESS MY FAMILY FELT BECAUSE THERE- WASN T A  CURE  TO SAVE OUR MOTHER.------ SINCE THAT TIME, WE VE LOST A DEAR AUNT AND- UNCLE TO CANCER AND, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH, MY DAD HAD- PROSTATE CANCER WHEN HE PASSED AWAY IN MAY------------ THESE ARE ALL REASONS FOR ME- TO RELAY, AND WHATEVER SMALL PART I PLAY IN RAISING MONEY FOR CANCER RESEARCH IS- A LABOR OF LOVE IN MEMORY OF THESE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SUSAN POE, TEAM RECRUITMENT---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- & FLAMES OF HOPE-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN- THE SPRING OF 1988, ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS (THE PRETTY BLONDE IN OUR ATTACHED- HOMECOMING DANCE PICTURE) WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. FOR 3 YEARS, SHE BATTLED- THIS DISEASE, BUT ULTIMATELY LOST HER BATTLE DURING OUR SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH- SCHOOL. DURING THAT TIME, I WASN'T THE FRIEND I COULD HAVE BEEN...I DIDN'T- REALLY KNOW QUITE WHAT TO DO OR WHAT TO SAY TO SHOW HER HOW MUCH I CARED. I WISH- WE HAD RELAY IN MY HOMETOWN BACK THEN - I KNOW WE COULD HAVE DONE SO MUCH TO- FIGHT CANCER, AS WELL AS SHOW OUR SUPPORT FOR OUR FRIEND. I LOVE SEEING FAMILIES- AND FRIENDS AT THE RELAY, OFTEN WITH THE SURVIVORS THEY ARE SUPPORTING - YOUR- HARD WORK MEANS SO MUCH TO THEM, AND TO ALL OF US WHO WANT TO FIND A CURE.

SECONDLY, I'M REMINDED OF THE MOMENTS IN MY LIFE THAT HAVE BEEN TOUCHED- BY CANCER (MY MOTHER-IN-LAW SURVIVING BREAST CANCER, MY OWN SCARE WITH A- SUSPICIOUS LUMP, AND THE DEATH OF TWO MOTHERS THIS YEAR IN MY SON'S 6TH GRADE- CLASS).------------------------------------------------------ WHEN I WAS ASKED LAST YEAR TO WALK IN THE- PITTSBORO RELAY FOR LIFE MY FIRST THOUGHT RACED TO THE DEATH OF A DEAR FRIEND'S- SON.------- I DON'T EVEN LIVE IN PITTSBORO AND MY IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WAS YES, SIGN ME- UP.------ THE ACHE IN MY HEART I FEEL EACH TIME I SEE MY FRIEND EASES SOMEWHAT WHEN I- SEE ALL OF THE RELAY TEAMS WORKING SO HARD TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE AMERICAN- CANCER SOCIETY.------ WORKING TOGETHER WE ARE ALL MAKING A DIFFERENCE----NO MATTER- HOW BIG OR HOW SMALL THE CONTRIBUTION.------------------------------------------------------ IF YOU EVER QUESTION WHY YOU DO THIS OR YOU BECOME- TIRED OF ASKING FOR DONATIONS OR SELLING THIS AND THAT...STOP FOR A MINUTE AND- THINK OF WHAT OTHERS HAVE LOST AND REMIND YOURSELF THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN YOUR- MOTHER, YOUR CHILD, OR YOUR BEST FRIEND WHO LOST THEIR BATTLE.------- ALL OF THE WORK- WE DO IS FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT SURVIVE AND FOR THOSE WHO WILL-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!

SHE WAS MY BEST FRIEND AND SOUL MATE.------ SHE HAD- SEVEN KIDS, 12 GRAND-KIDS, AND 11 GREAT-GRAND-CHILDREN------! EVEN THOUGH I WAS ONLY- ONE OF HER 12 GRAND-KIDS...SHE HAD A UNIQUE WAY OF MAKING ME FEEL I WAS HER VERY- FAVORITE. IN FACT, I EVEN SIGNED ALL MY CARDS TO HER----- "FROM YOUR FAVORITE- GRAND-DAUGHTER KAY.-----------" YOU KNOW IT TAKES SOMEONE VERY SPECIAL TO MAKE EACH ONE OF- US FEEL SO SPECIAL.--------------------------------------------- IN JANUARY 2000 MY GRANDMOTHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH- RENAL CANCER.------ SHE DIED ONE MONTH TO THE DAY OF HER DIAGNOSIS, FEBRUARY- 14, 2000 - VALENTINE'S DAY.------ SHE ACCEPTED WHAT GOD HAD GIVEN HER, BUT I HAD A MUCH HARDER- TIME LETTING GO.------ I MADE A CHOICE TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING TO HONOR HER- MEMORY...I JUST COULDN'T LET HER SLIP AWAY------! CANCER MAY HAVE STRUCK MY- GRANDMOTHER PHYSICALLY, BUT IT ACTUALLY ATTACKED OUR ENTIRE FAMILY - LEAVING A- HOLE WHERE SHE USED TO BE.------ BUT THE LORD IS ALWAYS GOOD AND WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS- WAYS AND I RESPONDED TO-A REQUEST FOR VOLUNTEERS FOR PITTSBORO'S FIRST ANNUAL- RELAY FOR LIFE WHICH WAS A HUGE SUCCESS---------------------------------------------! NOW I'D BE LYING TO MYSELF IF I ENDED THE STORY--THERE...MY PRIMARY REASON WAS TO HONOR MY OWN GRANDMOTHER, BUT THERE IS SO MUCH -MORE NOW.------ SINCE BEING INVOLVED WITH THE RELAY, I HAVE REALIZED THE NUMBER OF- FRIENDS, FAMILY, CO-WORKERS- ETC., THAT HAVE HAD-THEIR LIVES TOUCHED AND- DESTROYED IN SOME WAY BY CANCER...AND I TOO HAVE HAD MY OWN SCARES MORE THAN- ONCE.------ I ONLY NEEDED TO SEE THE BALD HEAD ON ONE CHILD TO PULL AT MY HEART- STRINGS, I ONLY NEEDED TO HEAR THE CRY OF ONE PARENT IN SORROW SO DEEP THAT- NO-ONE - NOT ANYONE - COULD COMFORT, I ONLY ONCE NEEDED TO SEE THE TEARS OF MY- PARENTS AT THE NEWS OF A LOSS OF A FRIEND (AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL) DUE TO- CANCER.------ AND I HAVE ONLY ONCE HAD TO FEEL THE HELPLESSNESS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO- HELP SOMEONE I CARE ABOUT.------ I RELAY BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A CURE AND- THAT WE ARE SO CLOSE TO FINDING IT...AND I AM HELPING IN SOME SMALL WAY TO FIND- IT------! I RELAY BECAUSE I REFUSE TO LET THIS DISEASE TO TAKE CONTROL AND JUST SIT- BACK AND WATCH------! I RELAY BECAUSE I CAN....HOW COULD YOU NOT?---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- KAY FARRELL, CO-CAPTAIN----- THE SURVIVORS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- JOEY TIMMONS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3-14-1988 - 5-25-2003 THE PITTSBORO RELAY FOR LIFE COMMITTEE EXTENDS THEIR SYMPATHY- TO THE FAMILY OF JOEY TIMMONS WHO LOST HIS BATTLE WITH CANCER ON MAY- 25, 2003, JUST ONE WEEK AFTER HE RODE IN THE SURVIVOR LAP AT OUR 2ND ANNUAL EVENT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WHY DO I RELAY? I HAVE ASKED MYSELF THIS SEVERAL--- TIMES. I GUESS THAT S WHY IT HAS TAKEN ME TO THIS, MY THIRD YEAR INVOLVED IN--- THE RELAY TO PUT IT INTO WORDS. I AM LUCKY. MY FAMILY HAS LITTLE TO NO CANCER.--- I HAVE NEVER LOST A CLOSE RELATIVE TO THIS HORRIBLE DISEASE. SO WHEN I THINK--- ABOUT WHY I RELAY I THINK-BECAUSE I WAS MEANT TO. IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO--- SUPPORT MY COMMUNITY, FRIENDS AND FAMILY BY GIVING BACK ALL THAT I CAN. I----BELIEVE THAT ALL THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON AND GOD HAS ALLOWED ME TO BE--- INVOLVED WITH THE RELAY FOR LIFE IN ORDER TO SHOW ME CANCER, ITS AFFECTS AND----ALLOW THESE TO TOUCH MY LIFE. SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHY I RELAY IT S TO SERVE--- MY FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY, TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT AGAINST THIS TRAGIC DISEASE--- AND TO TOUCH OTHERS LIVES AS I MY SELF HAVE BEEN TOUCHED. I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT--- MY EFFORTS COMPEL ANOTHER PERSON TO JOIN THIS FIGHT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GINNY--- BARBOUR---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FLAMES OF HOPE TEAM CAPTAIN-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------IN 2003, I RELAYED WITH THE SURVIVORS JUST TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP. THIS- YEAR, I WANTED TO MAKE A-BIGGER DIFFERENCE, SO I DECIDED TO FORM A TEAM OF MY- OWN. THEN IN NOVEMBER, I WAS GIVEN AN EVEN BIGGER REASON. MY MOM WAS DIAGNOSED- WITH BREAST CANCER. I FELT LIKE THE RUG HAD BEEN PULLED OUT FROM UNDER ME. BUT-, I KNEW WE HAD WORK TO DO AND I HAD TO BE BRAVE AND HAVE A DEEPER FAITH THAN EVER- BEFORE. I THANK THE LORD EVERYDAY BECAUSE THE CANCER WAS REMOVED AND NOW SHE IS- GOING THROUGH RADIATION TREATMENTS. MY MOM IS A SURVIVOR--------! I AM CO-CAPTAIN OF BELLS ANGELS, FROM BELLS BAPTIST CHURCH. OUR CHURCH HAS- BEEN HIT HARD BY CANCER OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. I FELT THAT IF ANY CHURCH- CONGREGATION HAD A REASON TO RELAY, IT'S US. SO, TOGETHER WITH JENNIFER- CHAMBERS, WE PUT A TEAM TOGETHER.-------- I JUST WANTED TO HELP....NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE RAISE, I JUST WANT TO HELP- FIGHT THIS DISEASE. THERE IS A CURE OUT THERE, WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING.

HE WAS NEVER SICK, ALWAYS HAD- ENERGY, LOVED TO FISH, PLAY WITH HIS GRANDCHILDREN, TRAVEL AND TEACH US LIFE'S- LESSONS. WHEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE CANCER, I WAS CRUSHED. IF CANCER- COULD STRIKE THIS MAN WHO I THOUGHT WAS INDESTRUCTIBLE, WHO NEXT. UNFORTUNATELY-, HE LOST HIS FIGHT WITH CANCER MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO. WE ALL MISS HIM DEARLY. I- RELAY IN HIS MEMORY---------! MY BROTHER, GEORGE, WAS ALSO STRUCK WITH CANCER SEVERAL YEARS AGO. I HAD A HARD- TIME DEALING WITH HIS ILLNESS. I STAYED AWAY BECAUSE I JUST-DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO -SAY OR DO OR EVEN HOW TO ACT. I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FORGIVE MYSELF FOR THAT- BECAUSE HE NEEDED HIS FAMILY DURING THAT TIME. HE RECOVERED AND IS IN FULL- REMISSION. I RELAY IN HIS HONOR----------!

JULIE PAYNE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SYNERGISTICS-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TEAM CAPTAIN---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MY INVOLVEMENT IN RELAY FOR LIFE WAS INITIATED BY A----- "COLD CALL-----" FROM CAROL- ESAU IN 2003 TO FORM A TEAM FROM OUR CHURCH. I HAD NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN THE- FIRST RELAY FOR LIFE EVENT, BUT HAD HEARD WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT IT. I TOOK THE- CHALLENGE, AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE-ONE OF THE MOST MEANINGFUL THINGS I HAVE DONE--IN MY LIFE. WHEN CANCER STRIKES SOMEONE YOU LOVE THERE IS NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO- BUT PRAY, AND BE SUPPORTIVE. I LOST MY GRANDFATHER TO COLON CANCER, MY- GRANDMOTHER WAS A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR, MY FATHER IS A MELANOMA SURVIVOR, TWO- COUSINS DIED OF MELANOMA AT AGES 41 AND 51, AND I HAVE ANOTHER COUSIN IN HER- FIGHT WITH BREAST CANCER, AND IT DOES NOT STOP THERE. MY BEST FRIEND FROM- COLLEGE DAYS HAS A 7 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO WAS DIAGNOSED AT AGE 4 WITH LIVER- CANCER. SHE IS IN HER THIRD YEAR AFTER HER TRANSPLANT AND DOING GREAT-------! AT OUR CHURCH ALONE WE HAVE LOST SEVERAL WONDERFUL CHURCH MEMBERS TO CANCER.- WE DO HAVE CANCER SURVIVORS IN OUR CHURCH AND I RELAY FOR THEM WITH THE HOPE- THAT THEY WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD TO KNOW- THAT THE MONEY WE RAISE AT RELAY FILTERS INTO THE LIVES OF SURVIVORS AT SOME- POINT IN TIME. MY HOPE IS THAT-THROUGH THIS FUNDRAISING FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL- HAVE ALTERNATIVES FOR-TREATMENT AND A HIGHER SUCCESS RATE FOR A CURE. EVERYONE--IS AFFECTED BY CANCER AT-SOME TIME IN THEIR LIFE.------ OUR STORIES ARE ABOUT--DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITH THE SAME DISEASE, CANCER.-------------- IF YOU GET A CALL TO PARTICIPATE IN RELAY ...-----"JUST DO IT-----", EVERYTHING ELSE- WILL SPEAK FOR ITSELF.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ TERRY WHITFIELD,------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE ANGEL BAND - MT.

I RELAY- FOR NICK, ONE OF THE FIRST FRIENDS I CAN REMEMBER, HE HAD LEUKEMIA. I REMEMBER- HIM NOT HAVING ANY HAIR AND ALWAYS WEARING-A FIREMAN'S HAT, HE NEVER GOT TO GROW- UP, HE DIED AT THE AGE OF--------- I RELAY FOR MY----- AUNT WHO IS A BREAST CANCER- SURVIVOR, SHE IS MY PROOF THAT THIS DISEASE CAN BE BEATEN. I RELAY FOR MY UNCLE-, WHO I NAMED MY TEAM AFTER, THE CORRIVEAU CRUSADERS, HE SURVIVED STOMACH CANCER, -ONLY TO SUCCUMB TO PANCREATIC CANCER A YEAR LATER. THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS IN MY- LIFE WHO FOUGHT THEIR BATTLES WITH CANCER, A FRIEND'S UNCLE, A TEACHER, A- NEIGHBOR, SOME HAVE WON, OTHERS HAVE LOST. THE WOUND THAT IS STILL THE FRESHEST- AND THE MOST PAINFUL IS THE ONE CAUSED BY THE LOSS OF----- "PA-----". PA WAS MY SURROGATE- GRANDFATHER, SINCE I NEVER HAD ONE OF MY OWN, HE-WAS MY FRIEND'S GRANDFATHER AND- I LIVED NEXT TO HIM MY ENTIRE LIFE. HE WAS AN AMAZING MAN TO EVERYONE WHO KNEW- HIM. HE HAD LUNG CANCER AND HAD HAD PORTIONS OF LUNG REMOVED YEARS EARLIER, IT- FINALLY CAUGHT UP TO HIM AND HE DIED LAST MARCH-------I RELAY SO I CAN DO MY- PART TO ERADICATE THIS AWFUL DISEASE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ KIM FILION------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE CORRIVEAU CRUSADERS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ C---------------------------------------------------HESHIRE-, CT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ SUBMIT YOUR REASON FOR RELAY TO---------------------------------------------------------------------------- INFO@PITTSBORORELAYFORLIFE.ORG---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
