I'VE DRIVEN UP TO THE-CHURCH TO RESERCH IT.--------------------------------------------RORY JONES FROM PORTHCAWL------------------------------------ IVE LIVED IN PORTHCAWL ALL OF MY LIFE AND THERE ARE SEVERAL PLACES I WONT EVEN GO TO THEY ARE SO CREEPY. THE WORST PLACE IS DEFINITELY MOOR LANE AND SKER BEACH. THEY ARE SUCH LOVELY PLACES WITH NICE SCENERY BUT-THERE IS A SINISTER FEELING IN THE AIR AS IF SOMETHING BAD HAS HAPPENED.------------------------------------------- DAI REES FROM CAERPHILLY------------------------------------ I WORKED IN THE PRINCE OF WALES, THE WETHERSPOONS PUB NEAR CARDIFF CENTRAL, OVER THE SUMMER OF 2006, AND THE UPSTAIRS BAR IS REPUTEDLY HAUNTED BY A FAMOUS ACTRESS WHO DIED THERE WHEN IT WAS A THEATRE. NOT SURE HOW TRUE THE STORY IS, BUT I THOUGHT FOR A SPLIT SECOND I SAW A DARK SHAPE, FROM THE CORNER OF MY EYE, WHERE THE FOOD ARRIVES... ANYONE EVER FEEL ANYTHING?------------------------------------------- SJ FROM PORTHCAWL------------------------------------ AT THE AGE OF AROUND 14-16 MY FRIENDS AND I USED TO OFTEN GO AND SPEND NIGHTS BY SKER HOUSE IN THE HOPE OF SEEING SOMETHING. AND BOY DID WE SEE SOMETHING!!! IT WAS ON OUR 3RD TRIP DOWN THERE WHEN WE HAD ALL BEEN SNOOPING CLOSE BY TO THE HOUSE (SORRY IF WE WERE TRESSPASSING) BUT WE ONLY MANAGED TO GET SO FAR AS THE BOUNDARY WALL WHEN WE COULD HEAR THIS FAINT WAILING NOISE - IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE WIND BUT NOT TOO SURE BUT THEN WE SEEN A FADED FIGURE SLIGHTLY LIGHTED APPEAR FROM THE RUIN OF THE SORT OF TOWER CLOSEST TO THE SEA. IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE US ACTUALLY GO HOME THAT NIGHT INSTEAD OF STAYING OUT AND AFTER ABOUT 11 YEARS I HAVE NOT BEEN BACK SINCE. THERE ARE FROM WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD SIGHTINGS AT ALONG THE ROCKS BETWEEN SKER AND KENFIG OF FIGURES REPORTEDLY FROM THE WRECK OF THE SAMPAMTA. ALSO SIGHTINGS AT THE PRINCE OF WALES IN KENFIG, THE ANGEL INN AT MAUDLAM...

PORTHCAWL IS A VERY MYSTERIOUS TOWN AND HAVE MANY A TALES OF HAUNTINGS. IT IS WELL WORTH A VISIT THERE AND SPENDING SOME TIME IN SOME OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED PLACES.------------------------------------------- STEPHEN PARRY ORIGINALLY FROM RUDRY NEAR CAERPHILL------------------------------------ NOT FAR FROM THE MAENLLWYD INN ARE-THE RUINS OF A HOUSE IN WHICH A WITCH LIVED IN THE MID 1800'S. SHE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE CURSED MY FAMILY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, BUT ON TWO OCCASIONS WHEN I HAVE WALKED UP THROUGH THE WOODS TO THE FIELD WHERE THE HOUSE WAS I HAVE SEEN NO ONE, BUT WHEN I STARTED TO GO BACK SOMEONE-HAD LEFT A BUNCH OF FLOWERS ON THE STILE GOING INTO THE FIELD. THIS STILE IS IN FULL VIEW, BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN WHO DID IT. STRANGE-------------------------------------------!! SAMANTHA SMITH (FROM ELY)------------------------------------ I ONCE GOT LOCKED IN A BEDROOM WHERE I WAS LIVING IN A HOUSE IN SPLOTT. THERE-WAS NO CATCH OR LOCK ON THE DOOR, AND WHEN I TRIED IT, THE HANDLE TURNED BUT THE DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN.- THE DOOR WAS NEVER SHUT, AS IT WOULDN'T STAY SHUT - HAVING NO CATCH.- I WAS LOCKED IN THERE FOR ABOUT 10 MINS WITH MY BOYFRIEND, AND WHEN HE TRIED TO OPEN IT, HIS HAND STARTED BLEEDING, BUT ON WHAT - WE DON'T KNOW.- EVENTUALLY, I TRIED THE DOOR AGAIN, AND NEARLY FELL OVER AS IT WAS AS EASY AS A FEATHER. AT THE TIME, ONLY THE TWO OF US LIVED IN THE HOUSE. ALSO, THINGS WOULD GO MISSING, AND TURN UP A FEW WEEKS LATER IN THE MOST STRANGE AND WEIRD, EVEN DANGEROUS PLACES.

ONE NIGHT I HEARD A LOUD BANG COMING FROM THE BAR AND THOUGHT I HAD BEEN BROKEN INTO BUT THE ALARM DIDN'T GO OFF SO I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT. THE NEXT MORNING I MADE IT TO THE BAR BEFORE THE CLEANER AND THE CHAIR NEAREST THE MAIN DOOR HAD BEEN KNOCKED BACK ONTO THE FLOOR AND THERE WERE BOTTLES BEHIND THE BAR THAT HAD BEEN HIT OVER. IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME BUT IT SEEMS TOO MUCH OF A COINCIDENCE. I'VE BEEN TOLD BY PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN FEEL SOMETHING AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS BY THE WOMEN'S TOILETS.

JULS FROM GWENT.------------------------------------- HI ALL IM A MEDIA STUDENT,FOR A PROJECT I HAVE TO DO A SMALL HORROR, SPOOKY TRAILER FILM LASTING 3-5 MINS, I AM LOOKING FOR A SPOOKY- HOUSE TO FILM, IF ANYONE HAS SUCH A PLACE AND COULD OFFER THIS POOR MATURE STUDENT A CHANCE- TO PROVE HER TALENTS PLEASE CONTACT ME SPINELLIBLONDE@AOL.COM THNX------------------------------------------- BILL FROM HENGOED------------------------------------ PENALLTA COLLIERY - I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES TO TAKE PHOTO'S OF THE BEAUTIFUL OLD ENGINE HALL, HOWEVER ON-ONE TRIP I WAS TAKING-SOME SHOTS OF THE PIT WHEELS SILHOUETTED AGAINST THE SKY WHEN I SAW A BOY IN A WHITE SHIRT WAVING FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THEM. I WAVED BACK AND TOOK A PHOTO, AND CARRIED ON SNAPPING AWAY. AROUND TWENTY MINUTES LATER THE LAD HAD STILL NOT CAME DOWN SO I SHOUTED UP TO HIM. AS I DID THIS I REALISED THAT THE STEPS TO THE PIT WHEEL HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE LEGS WERE WRAPPED IN BARBED WIRE FOR THE VERY PURPOSE OF STOPPING PEOPLE FROM CLIMBING UP - ASSUMING THAT HOWEVER HE HAD GOT UP THERE, THE BOY MUST HAVE THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SHOUT AT HIM FOR TRESPASSING AND WAS STAYING STILL TO AVOID ME. AFTER A WHILE I WAS QUITE CONCERNED, BUT-BEING UNABLE TO CLIMB UP MYSELF I ASKED SOME OTHER BOYS WHO HAD TURNED UP IF THEY WERE MISSING A FRIEND - NO WAS THE REPLY, AND DESPITE MY WARNINGS ONE BOY PROCEEDED TO CLIMB UP THE OPPOSITE PIT WHEEL, WHICH STILL HAD SOME STEPS ATTATCHED - FROM HIS VIEW AT THE TOP HE REPORTED THAT THE OTHER PIT WHEEL WAS EMPTY. WE CHECKED THE SURROUNDING BUSHES IN FEAR THAT THE BOY HAD FALLEN, BUT FOUND NOTHING. AT THIS POINT, FEELING PRETTY FOOLISH BUT INSISTING THE BOY HAD BEEN THERE, I COMMENTED TO THE LADS ABOUT LOSING MY MARBLES AND LEFT. I WAS QUITE BEMUSED BY THE EVENT AND PUT IT DOWN TO THE LADS PLAYING A TRICK ON ME, SO YOU CAN IMAGINE MY BEWILDERMENT WHEN THE DEVELOPED PHOTOGRAPHS SHOWED NOT ONLY THE WHITE SHIRTED BOY AT THE TOP OF THE PIT WHEEL, BUT ALSO AT THE FOOT OF THE SAME PITWHEEL, STANDING IN THE DOORWAY-OF THE ENGINE HALL, AND IN SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE INTERIOR OF THE ENGINE-ROOM! MY EYESIGHT IS-PERFECT, AND I STILL STAND MY GROUND THAT THAT BOY WAS NOT THERE WHEN I TOOK THE PHOTOS.-------------------------------------------- DEMI AND JOSH FROM NEWPORT------------------------------------ WE WERE WALKING MY DOG AROUND TREDEGAR HOUSE WHEN OUR DOG STARTED BARKING AND KEPT ON STARING AT THE POND.

I ALSO WENT ON A GHOST TOUR HALLOWEEN NIGHT ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO WITH MY FAMILY AND MY PARTNER. I HAVE ALWAYS HATED THE SMALL ROOM WITH THE SINGLE BED AND COT IN (THE BIRTHING ROOM), AS I HAVE ALWAYS FELT SOMETHING THERE WHEN VISITING DURING THE DAY. AS MYSELF AND OUR GROUP OF VISITORS WALKED IN I NOTICED HOW COLD IT WAS IN THERE. THE GUIDE STARTED EXPLAINING HOW THE ROOM USED-TO BE USED WHEN SOMEONE OR SOMETHING PULLED ON MY JACKET. I JUST LOOKED AT THE STRANGER NEXT TO ME AND THOUGHT WHAT ARE YOU DOING, AND THEN TH=URNED AND CARRIED ON LISTENING TO THE GUIDE. THROUGH ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING I HAD THIS TUGGING ON MY JACKET. IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE TOUR THAT I MENTIONED THIS TO THE GUIDE AND HE JUST LAUGHED AND-SAID 'YEAH A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD THAT - ITS JUST THE CHILDREN PLAYING'. FREAKED ME RIGHT OUT AND I THINK I SCARED THAT INNOCENT STRANGER NEXT TO ME WITH ME STARING AT HIM THINKING IT WAS HIM TUGGING MY JACKET - OOOOPS-------------------------------------------!

IT HAPPENED A WHILE AGO. ANYWAY, IT WAS REALLY LATE AT NIGHT---- & I WAS JUST WATCHING T.V. WITH MY CAT RAU'LE ON MY ARM REST WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN MY CAT TILTED ALL THE WAY UP STARING AT THE CEILING. I ONLY THOUGHT WEIRD. I GOT CURIOUS AND LOOKED UP, AND IN LIGHT COLORS WERE THE LETTERS H I ! I WAS SO FREAKED OUT ! I STILL SWEAR MY CAT WAS COMMUNICATING WITH ME------------------------------------------- ! MARK FROM PENARTH------------------------------------ I HAVE HEARD STORIES ABOUT THE FIELDS ADJACENT TO COGAN HALL FARM.(WITH REFERENCE TO SOPIE FROM PENARTHS EXPERIENCE)THERE IS AN INCREDIBLY OLD CHURCH AND GRAVEYARD ON THE SITE WHICH MIGHT BE WORTH RESEARCHING. I HEARD A STORY ABOUT A GHOST THAT WAS WATCHING- THE LOCAL CHILDREN AS THEY CAMPED OUT DOWN THE DELL. HE HAD RED EYES AND AS THEY TRIED TO TAKE CHASE AS HE FLED, THE FASTEST OF THE GROUP COULD NOT KEEP UP AS THE SPECTRE FLEW OVER A HEDGEROW AND VANISHED INTO THE DIRECTION OF THE FARM/CHURCH/GRAVEYARD.------------------------------------------- BEPPIE FROM PORTHCAWL------------------------------------! YEH SKER HOUSE IS HAUNTED COS MY BEST MATE FROM SCHOOL, HER MUM USED TO LIVE THERE AS IT WAS A FAMILY HOME PASSED DOWN THROUGH THE MORGAN FAMILY. HER FATHER DIED THERE FROM A CHEST INFECTION AND IF YOU GO THROUGH THE HOUSE IN A CERTAIN ROOM YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND OF A MAN STRUGGLING FOR HIS BREATH. ALSO THE MAID OF SKER IS THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF THE MORGANS FROM MANY GENERATIONS AGO.- HE LOCKED HER IN A ROOM AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE AND EVER SINCE SHE HAS BEEN SEEN WANDERING THE DUNES AND SEEN AROUND THE HOUSE AS IF SHE'S HAPPY TO BE FINALLY FREED.------------------------------------------- AMANDA FROM BRIDGEND------------------------------------ SOUTHERNDOWN BEACH IS A SCARY PLACE TO BE AT NIGHT AND WITH ITS NOTORIOUS HISTORY OF PIRATES I AM NOT SURPRISED.- I SAW A DARK SHADOWY FIGURE MANY YEARS AGO IN THE CAR PARK - IT WALKED PAST THE CAR I WAS IN. AND WHEN I ASKED MY FRIENDS WHO IT WAS THEY ALL SAID NO ONE.- MY MATE TURNED THE CAR AROUND TO WHERE THIS PERSON WOULD HAVE BEEN STANDING.- THERE WAS NO ONE THERE, JUST A BIG DROP TO THE BEACH.------------------------------------------- GHANDI OPNHAN FROM VIETNAM------------------------------------- I EMIGRATED TO AUSTRALIA WHEN I WAS 23 YEARS OLD. ONE CHRISTMAS I CAME BACK HOME TO WALES TO VISIT MY GRANDMOTHER IN HER 'NEW HOUSE' THAT SHE HAD JUST MOVED INTO. WHEN SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE MOVED INTO A NEW HOUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT, BUT WHEN I ACTUALLY GOT TO HER HOUSE, I FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS LIVING IN A CONVERTED SCHOOL, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WELSH COUNTRYSIDE. IT LOOKED KINDA FREAKY FROM THE OUTSIDE, BUT FROM THE INSIDE, IT WAS A WARM HOME ... OR SO I THOUGHT! ON THE FIRST NIGHT, I SLEPT IN THE VERY TOP ROOM OF THE HOUSE, THE ATTIC. I WAS JUST DRIFTING OFF TO SLEEP WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF CHILDREN PLAYING. I OPENED MY EYES AND THERE WERE 4 LITTLE GIRLS AT THE BOTTOM OF MY BED DANCING AROUND IN A CIRCLE AND SINGING. I TOTALY FREAKED BECAUSE THEY WERENT FROM OUR ERA, THEY LOOKED VICTORIAN-! FREAKY, AS MY NAN LIVES IN A CONVERTED VICTORIAN SCHOOL-------------------------------------------!! MARK FROM SWANSEA------------------------------------ I AM VERY INTERESTED IN SKER HOUSE, AND PERSONALLY THINK THAT IT IS HAUNTED! I MEAN JUST LOOK AT IT... I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY PEOPLE CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN THE "MAID OF SKER", AND OTHER GHOSTS. IS THIS ABSOLUTELY GENUINE, OR ARE YOU MAKING IT UP? ARE THERE ANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE 100% SEEN A GHOST AT OR NEAR SKER HOUSE IN KENFIG? ALSO ABERGLASNEY NEAR LLANDEILO? I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED TO READ YOUR STORIES. NO JOKERS PLEASE--------------------------------------------!!!! MOE FROM THE US------------------------------------ I BELIEVE EVERYONE OF YOU! GOOD THING I DON'T LIVE WHERE YOU GUYS LIVE... I WOULD FREAK OUT!! HERE'S FREAKY STORY THAT HAPPENED TO ME ABOUT TWO OR THREE MONTHS AGO! ONE TIME I WAS LISTENING TO SLIPKNOT (A HEAVY METAL BAND I LIKE) IN MY DVD PLAYER, AND THIS SONG I DIDN'T LIKE AT THE TIME CAME ON (TRACK NUMBER 8) AND MY DVD PLAYER TURNED IT TO TRACK NUMBER 12 (I THINK IT TURNED TO 12 I HAD IT ON SHUFFLE), I DIDN'T TOUCH MY REMOTE OR DO ANYTHING I WAS JUST STANDING THERE LOOKING PUZZLED TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO CHANGED IT! I AM STILL TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT, TOO-------------------------------------------!! DIANA FROM OHIO.------------------------------------ I'VE BEEN TO WALES MANY TIMES WE GO THERE ON TRIPS BUT WE VISITED LLANCIACH FAWR MANOR AND WE WERE ON THE BOTTOM FLOOR AND I WAS LOOKING IN A MIRROR AND MY HUSBAND JAMES WENT OUTSIDE JUST TO LOOK AROUND AND WHILE I WAS LOOKING AT THE MIRROR I SAW LIKE A SHADOWY FIGURE STANDING AND THEN I SHUT MY EYES CAUSE I HAD SOMETHING IN ONE OF MY EYES. AND THEN WHEN I OPENED THEM UP I LOOKED AT THE MIRROR AGAIN AND A PERSON WAS STANDING THERE. HE JUST LOOKED LIKE A NORMAL HUMEN. AND THEN I TURNED AROUND AND NO ONE WAS THERE.------------------------------------------- MARK FROM SWANSEA------------------------------------ HELLO AGAIN, MY FAVOURITE PLACES AROUND HERE ARE ABERGLASSNEY, CRAIG-Y-NOS, SKER HOUSE, PLAS TEG, MARGAM PARK. THESE PLACES I BELIEVE TO BE GENUINLEY HAUNTED ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER LOCATIONS IN WALES ITS UNBELIEVABLE. HAS ANYBODY ACTUALLY GENUINLEY SEEN A GHOST IN ANY OF THESE LOCATIONS?------------------------------------------- JO FROM MERTHYR TYDFIL------------------------------------ CYFARHFA CASTLE IS DEFINATLEY HAUNTED! WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL THERE SOME 16 OR 17 YEARS AGO IN A RAINY LUNCH HOUR IN A CLASSROOM WHICH WAS ALLEGEDLY CRAWSHAY'S BDROOM (HOW TRUE THAT IS I AM NOT SURE) WE PRETENDED TO CONDUCT A SEANCE (OBVIOULSY NOT DOING IT PROPERLY AS ONLY 11 AT THE TIME AND HAD NO EXPERIENCE IN THESE MATTERS!) AND WE STUPIDLY ASKED FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN THAT WOULD CAUSE US TO HAVE TIME OFF SCHOOL BUT NOT TO HARM ANYONE OR ANYTHING. AS WE REQUESTED THIS THE WINDOW SLAMMED SHUT AND THE BOARD RUBBER FELL ON THE FLOOR. THE VERY NEXT DAY THE SCHOOL WAS CLOSED AS A STORM HAD CAUSED SOME TRESS TO FALL ON THE DRIVEWAY LEADING UP TO THE CASTLE. MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE I WOULD SAY-------------------------------------------!! SHOPPING FAN------------------------------------ AT MACARTHUR GLEN SHOPPING VILLAGE IN BRIDGEND I SAW THIS GIRL RUNNING AROUND. SHE RAN FROM NEAR THE ENTRANCE BY THE ODEON AND THEN DOWN PAST A JEWELERS SHOP, PAST A SHOP THAT SELLS PAPERS AND ANOTHER THAT SELLS TOWELS. IT RAN ACROSS TO THE SHOE SHOP THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN STRAIGHT THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS THE RESTAURANT AREA AND OVER THE TO THE PLAY AREA BEFORE VANISHING. WHEN I SAY SHE RAN THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS... SHE WENT THROUGH THEM WITHOUT OPENING. IT WAS QUITE WEIRD BUT NOT SPOOKY! KEEP AN EYE OPEN NEXT TIME YOU ARE THERE AND GO IN AND QUESTION THE STAFF, I BET THEY MUST HAVE SEEN IT LOADS OF TIMES-------------------------------------------! SOPHIE TUCKER- FROM NEWPORT------------------------------------- ON MY 2ND WEDDING ANNIVERSARY, MY HUSBAND AND I DECIDED TO GO OUT ON A DRIVE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. WE ENDED UP STOPPING FOR A DRINK AT A PUB WHICH WE HAD NEVER COME ACROSS BEFORE. WHEN WE ENTERED THE PUB THE PEOPLE WERE ALL DRESSED IN CLOTHES WHICH I THINK WERE FROM THE 18TH CENTURY- BUT WE DIDNT THINK ANYTHING OF IT AS WE MARRIED ON THE 31ST OF OCTOBER, AND IT WAS HALLOWEEN. WE HAD OUR DRINK AND THEN LEFT. THE NEXT DAY WE DECIDED TO FIND THE PUB TO HAVE LUNCH IN. WE DROVE ALL OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE.....AND WE STILL HAVENT FOUND THE PUB TO THIS VERY DAY-------------------------------------------! CLAIRE T AND RHIANNON W- FROM CWMBRAN------------------------------------ WE VISITED LLANCIACH FAWR MANOR ON A SCHOOL TRIP WHEN WE WERE IN PRIMARY SCHOOL. IT DOES HAVE AN EERIE ATMOSPHERE, BUT WE DIDNT-EXPERIENCE ANY PARENORMAL ACTIVITIES! CLAIRE IS OBSESSED WITH THE PROGRAM 'MOST HAUNTED' AND SHE IS CRAVING TO WATCH THE VISUAL THAT THEY DID AT LLANCIACH FAWR!! WE REALLY WANT TO COME TO LLANCIACH FAWR MANOR FOR ONE OF THE GHOST HUNT NIGHTS, BUT WE ARE ONLY 14 YEARS OLD AND YOU HAVE TO BE 16 TO GO!!! GUTTED-------------------------------------------!! GERAINT- FROM MERTHYR TYDFIL------------------------------------ I AM IN CYFARTHFA SCHOOL AND I USED TO HELP OUT IN THE LIBARY. ONE LUNCH TIME ME AND ONE OTHER LIBARIAN WERE CLEARING UP WHEN ONE OF THE CHAIRS MOVED AND THEY ARE BIG HEAVY CHAIRS. SO WE STOPPED AND JUST LOOKED AT EACH OTHER. WE CARRIED ON AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN. IT GOT WORSE WHEN I PUT THE KEY IN THE DOOR AND IT WOULDN'T OPEN. WHEN WE FINALY GOT OUT WE WERE SCARED TO SAY THE LEAST. AFTER THAT, THE HEATER WOULD TURN ON ON IT'S OWN ON A REGULAR BASIS.------------------------------------------- AMY- FROM TREDEGAR------------------------------------ TREDEGAR HOUSE IS HAUNTED, AND THE PARK SURROUNDING IT, SO MANY WEIRD ENCOUNTERS HAPPEN THERE - DONT COME TO TREDEGAR PARK OR HOUSE AT NIGHT!! IT'S SPOOKY AND WILL GIVE YOU THE CREEPS-!!! I HAVE ONCE SEEN A STRANGE SHAPE IN THE WINDOW OF TREDEGAR HOUSE, I LOOKED BACK AND IT WAS GONE.- ANOTHER ENCOUNTER I HAVE HAD WAS ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO, AN OLD PUB WHICH BURNED DOWN A-FEW YEARS AGO, WE WERE LOOKING IN THE SPACE WHERE A PANE OF GLASS SHOULD BE, BUT INSTEAD IT WAS BLACK. MY FRIEND LOOKED IN AND CALLED MY OTHER FRIEND CHLOE. I LOOKED UP AND CALLED MY FRIEND ASHLEY, BUT WHEN HE LOOKED UP HE THOUGHT THAT WE WERE BEING STUPID CAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. . .-------------------------------------------- CARLA FROM PONTYPOOL------------------------------------ THE OTHER DAY IN WESTMON SCHOOL I WAS LOOKING FOR MY FRIENDS WHO HAD BEEN IN ANOTHER LESSON, AND I CAME ACROSS AN EMPTY CORRIDOR. I WAS WALKING ALONG IT AND I COULD HAVE SWORN THERE WAS SOMEONE (OR SOMETHING) WALKING BEHIND ME, BUT IT WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY.------------------------------------------- CHRISTINE WATS FROM PONTYPRIDD------------------------------------ IN WALES THEIR ARE SO MANY GHOSTS IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. I HAVE SEEN ONE BEFORE IN MY SCHOOL, ST.ALBANS. MY ADVICE TO PEOPLE WHO GET SCARED EASILY IS DON'T GO TO WALES.------------------------------------------- NATELIE BRIGGS FROM PONTYPOOL------------------------------------ ONCE WHEN I WAS IN WESTMON SCHOOL I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS UP THE TOP OF THE STAIRS ABOVE THE ENGLISH ROOMS. SO ME AND MY FRIEND WENT UP THERE AND THERE WAS AN OLD ROOM WE THOUGHT WE HEARD SOMEONE TROWING SOMETHING LIKE A CHAIR BUT WHEN WE WENT IN NO - ONE WAS THERE-------------------------------------------! MARK FROM SWANSEA------------------------------------ I AM A BELIEVER BUT ALSO INSIST THAT YOU MUST BE SCEPTICAL, AND TO OUTRULE BASIC THINGS FIRST BEFORE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS.I'M VERY SUPRISED THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCH INTEREST IN ABERGLASSNEY(A VERY STRANGE PLACE!) AND ALSO CRAIG Y NOS CASTLE WHERE I HAVE ENCOUNTERED MY OWN EXPERIENCES. I AM STILL WAITING TO SEE A GHOST THOUGH! SKER HOUSE IS HAUNTED, JUST LOOK AT IT!!! HAS ANYBODY GENUINLEY SEEN A GHOST AT MARGAM PARK?-------------------------------------------- CLOIE WALSHE FROM NEWPORT------------------------------------ TREDEGAR HOUSE IS REALLY SCARY BECAUSE I SAW A GHOST IN THERE.-------------------------------------------- SIAN, CARDIFF------------------------------------ I VISITED LLANCAICH FAWR ON A LATE NIGHT GHOST WALK. IT WAS REALLY FREAKY BUT THERE'S NO MALICE IN THAT HOUSE AT ALL, EXCEPT FOR ONE ROOM WHICH JUST FEELS TERRIBLY SAD. I HAD A PAIN IN MY LEG AND THE GUIDE THEN TOLD-ME THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE GET LEG PAINS IN THERE AND APPARENTLY THERE WAS A MAN WITH A WOODEN LEG WHO LIVED THERE. MY FRIEND AND I FELT REALLY COLD BLASTS OF AIR ON OUR HANDS AND I FELT THEM ACROSS MY FACE. WE ALSO HEARD A CRY WHEN WE WERE IN THE CHILDS ROOM. I ASLO MANAGED TO FREAK THE GUIDE OUT WHEN WE WERE IN THE KITCHEN BY SAYING THAT I FELT PAINS IN MY CHEST AND GOT THE FEELING OF TWO WOMEN SITTING NEXT TO THE FIRE WITH BLANKETS OVER THEM AND MAKING THINGS. SHE TOLD ME THAT OVER CHRISTMAS, SHE HAD BEEN SITTING THERE, WRAPPED IN BLANKETS AND SHE HAD A VERY BAD ASTHMA ATTACK. I THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO DISMISS IT AS RUBBISH SHOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT CONDEMMING IT-------------------------------------------!! BALLY- FROM SNARESBROOK------------------------------------ ONCE ME AND MY STEP SISTER WERE LOST IN SNARESBROOK CEMETRY. AFTER A FEW HOURS TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE A MASSIVE FOREST, WE GAVE UP AND SAT ON A STONE. THE STONE BROKE AND A SKULL ROLLED OUT. FREAKY--------------------------------------------ABI FROM CARDIFF------------------------------------ THE GEORGE INN AT ST.BRIAVELS IS EXTREMELY SCARY. I STAYED THERE AFTER OUR CAR BROKE DOWN RIGHT NEAR IT. I STAYED IN ROOM 4 AND I WAS GETTIN READY IN THE BATHROOM AND CLEANING MY TEETH, WHEN I HEARD A KNOCK ON MY DOOR SO I WENT TO OPEN IT AND AS I DID I FELT A BREEZE OF COLD AIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK! THERE WAS- NO-ONE THERE BUT I WAS SURE I COULD SEE THE OUTLINE OF A PERSON WALKING DOWN THE HALL. I SHUT THE DOOR AND FELT THE EXACT SAME RUSH OF COLD AIR BUT THIS TIME IN MY FACE. ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT I COULD HEAR FOOTSTEPS ON THE LANDING.-- I TOLD THE CO OWNER AND SHE SAID THAT THAT WAS THE GHOST OF THE OLD OWNER OF THE GEORGE INN AND SHE OFTEN STILL WALKED ALONG THE LANDING. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT I WAS VERY LUCKY TO HAVE A GLIMPSE OF HER BECAUSE NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE SEEN HER. BUT THE CO OWNER WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE HER TOO AND BELIEVED EVERY THING I TOLD HER--! IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SCARY NIGHT I RECOMMEND THERE AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T SEE THE GHOST IT IS GREAT FUN ANYWAY-------------------------------------------! TESSA FROM WALSALL------------------------------------ I'VE BEEN TO WALES A FAIR FEW TIMES BUT NOTHING SPOOKY HAS EVER HAPPENED THERE. BUT IF ANYONE HAS EVER BEEN TO INGESTRE HALL, THEN THEY'LL KNOW OF THE BLUE STAIRCASE. NOW THE OWNERS USE INGESTRE HALL FOR SCHOOL TRIPS AND I WENT FOR A MUSIC TRIP. THE BLUE STAIRCASE IS OFTEN USED FOR WEDDINGS AND THATS WERE THE BRIDE WILL WALK DOWN. ONE NIGHT AFTER REHERSALS I WAS WALKING PAST AND I SAW A LADY IN A WEDDING DRESS AT THE TOP. I MUST HAVE LOOKED EMBARRESSED AS SHE SMILED. "I'M SO SORRY I DIDN'T REALISE THERE WAS A WEDDING GOING ON, I HOPE I HAVEN'T CAUSED ANY INCONVIENIENCE." THE WOMAN LAUGHED AND SAID NOT TO WORRY AS THE WEDDING HAD BEEN CANCELLED. I THOUGHT NOTHING MORE ABOUT IT AND WENT OFF TO BED.--- NEXT MORNING AT BREAKFAST I ASKED MY TEACHER IF THERE HAD BEEN A WEDDING HERE LAST NIGHT. HE LOOKED AT ME PUZZLED AND SAID "WHAT, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS WHY WOULD THEY DOUBLE BOOK. IT'S ALL YOUR IMAGINATION!" I DECIDED TO GET A SECONGD OPINION AND WENT TO THE CO-OWNER. HE DIDN'T SEEM AT ALL SURPRISED BY WHAT I TOLD HIM AND SAID THAT IT WAS THE BRIDE THAT I HAD SEEN ON THE STAIRCASE. HE TOLD ME THAT YEARS AND YEARS AGO, THERE-WAS GOING TO BE A WEDDING BUT THE BRIDE HAD SLEPT WITH THE BEST MAN. HER FIANCE HAD FOUND OUT AND KILLED HER ON THE STAIRS IN HER WEDDING DRESS. SHE ONLY WILL APPEAR TO SOMEONE WALKING BY THEMSELVES (THAT'S WHY THEY HAD TOLD US TO GO AROUND IN PAIRS OR MORE) PAST THE STAIRCASE. I WAS A BIT FREAKED OUT BY THIS BUT WALKED PAST AGAIN THE NEXT NIGHT AND SAW HER AGAIN BUT THIS TIME WAVED SMILED AND WENT. THE LAST NIGHT WHEN WE LEFT I WAS GOING BACK INTO THE HOUSE TO GET MY FLUTE AND I WALKED PAST THE STAIRCASE. SOMEONE SAID GOODBYE TO ME AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS THE OWNER OR SOMETHING, BUT WHEN I TURNED, THE BRIDE WAS WALKING UP THE STAIRCASE, SHE WAVED AT ME SO I WAVED BACK AND THEN SHE DISAPPEARED.-- I DID TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS BUT NO ONE EXCEPT THE OWNER AND CO-OWNER BELIEVED ME.------------------------------------------- GEORGE, COURTICE CANADA EX-PONTYPRIDD------------------------------------ WHEN I WORKED AT BORG WARNER AT KENFIG I WAS TOLD ABOUT THE GHOST OF A MONK THAT HAUNTED THE FACTORY (BUILT ON THE SITE OF THE OLD ABBEY) BUT JUST DISMISSED IT AS A WIND UP OF THE NEW GUY. THEN WHEN I WAS WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT AND MOST OF THE LIGHTS WERE TURNED OFF I SAW A DARK SHAPE MOVING AROUND THE MACHINES. I TRIED TO FOLLOW IT BUT IT SEEMED TO MELT THROUGH A WIRE CAGE AND THEN THE WALL. I LEFT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION TO GET TO THE LIGHTS-------------------------------------------! KARLIE FROM ABERTILLERY------------------------------------! THE OLD W WING IN WEST MON SCHOOL IN PONTYPOOL IS SAID TO BE HAUNTED.- SO THE STORY GOES A YOUNG BOY HUNG HIMSELF FROM THE BELL TOWER AT THE BACK OF THE ENGLISH ROOMS.- I NEVER SAW ANYTHING BUT THE CUBOARD WHERE HE SUPPOSDLY STAYED ALWAYS HAD A VERY COLD AND BAD VIBE-! KARLIE-------------------------------------------! CLAIRE FROM CAERPHILLY------------------------------------ CAERPHILLY CASTLE - IT'S NOT EXACTLY SCARY BUT THERE IS DEFINATELY SOMETHING THERE. IN THE RUINS OF THE SOLAR BEHIND THE GREAT HALL I CAN ALMOST HEAR A WOMAN SINGING - JUST THE SOUND OF A TUNE I CAN NEVER REMEMBER AND WORDS I CAN'T MAKE OUT. ONE NIGHT WE WERE DRIVING PAST AT ABOUT 10:30 AND MY FRIEND ASKED IF THE CASTLE WAS STILL OPEN BECAUSE SHE'D SEEN A WOMAN ON TOP OF ONE OF THE TOWERS.------------------------------------------- LINDA GRIFFITHS------------------------------------ IF ANY BODY WANTS ANY PROOF THAT SPIRITS DO EXIST THEN WATCH OUT FOR "WORLD'S SCARIEST GHOSTS" ON BRAVO. I HAVE SEEN IT A FEW TIMES AND IT IS DEAD FREAKY. IT SHOWS A LITTLE GIRL SITTING AT HER TABLE AND THE CHAIR IS MOVING BUT SHE IS 100% NOT MOVING IT HERSELF COS HER FEET ARE RESTING ON THE BAR. IT IS SCARY AND THE THINGS THEY SHOW, I BELIEVE IT IS 100% TRUE.-------------------------------------------- TONNA - NEATH- - SOUTH - WALES------------------------------------ ID JUST LIKE TO SAY RIGHT FROM THE START THAT I'M A VERY SCEPTICAL PERSON, AND CAN'T QUITE RATIONALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED IN MY PREVIOUS HOUSE.-- MYSELF AND MY MOTHER HAD LIVED IN A HOUSE IN HENFAES RD IN TONNA FOR 17 YEARS, AND HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING REMOTELY STRANGE NOR FELT UNCOMFORTABLE AT ALL. BUT FOR A PERIOD OF AROUND 6 MONTHS SOME STRANGE THINGS OCCURED THAT ARE QUITE HARD TO EXPLAIN. WHEN I WAS 16, MYSELF AND MY GIRLFRIEND WERE IN MY BEDROOM WATCHING TV AND EATING FOOD, WHEN A TUBE OF MY GIRLFRIENDS LIP BALM, THAT WAS SITTING ON MY DESK ON THE OPPOSTITE SIDE OF THE ROOM, SOMEHOW JUST WENT THROUGH THE AIR AND LANDED IN BETWEEN US. WE BOTH SAW-THE OBJECT COME TOWARDS US AND LAND ON THE-BED. IT COMPLETELY FREKED US OUT AND NEITHER OF US COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT COULD HAVE MADE IT MOVE. THIS WAS THE FIRST PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE HAD OF ANYTHING UNUSUAL AND I STILL FIND IT HARD TO CONCEIVE HOW IT COULD HAVE DONE THAT.-- IN THE FOLLOWING MONTHS SEVERAL SIMILAR INCIDENTS OCCURED, ESPECIALLY AN OCCASION ONE NIGHT WHERE LOUD BANGING NOISES CAME FROM DOWNSTAIRS FOR A SEVERAL MINUTES, (AS IF SOMEONE WAS TRASHING OUR LIVING ROOM), AND NOTHING WAS OUT OF-PLACE WHEN WE WENT DOWN TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THE NOISE JUST SUDDENLY STOPPED, AND NOTHING AT ALL WAS MOVED OR MISPLACED, AND ALL THE DOORS WERE STILL LOCKED. TO THIS DAY I CANT IMAGINE WHAT COULD HAVE CREATED SUCH A REALISTIC AND FRIGHTENING NOISE. IT WAS AS IF SOMETHING WAS LITERALLY DOWNSTAIRS. FOR A FAMILY OF SCEPTICAL AND RATIONAL THINKERS, IT BECAME QUITE A STRANGE AND ANNOYING EXPERIENCE, THOUGH GLADLY ONE DAY IT JUST STOPPED.-- ITS BEEN QUITE A WHILE NOW SINCE ALL THIS HAPPENED, BUT IT WOULD BE QUITE NICE TO HEAR FROM ANYONE ELSE THAT EXPERIENCED SIMILAR THINGS.-------------------------------------------- ONAI FROM LEEDS------------------------------------ MOUNT ST MARY'S HIGH SCHOOL IS HAUNTED BY A HEADLESS NUN. ASK ANYONE WHO GOES THERE. EVEN THE DEPUTY HEAD, MR BOOTHE, WHO'S WORKED THERE FOR A REALLY LONG TIME (AND I'M NOT KIDDING I MEAN A REALLY LONG-TIME!!) WILL TELL YOU THAT HE'S SEEN IT. AND TRUST ME HE'S NOT THE TYPE OF GUY THAT "JOKES" AROUND ABOUT STUFF LIKE THIS--!!!! ONE TIME IN YEAR 7 I WAS IN MY MUSIC LESSON, ABSOLUTELY BORED TO DEATH. THEN SUDDENLY THE WHOLE CLASS HEARD A THUD IN THE CORRIDOR. MY TEACHER WENT OUT TO CHECK AND FOUND NOTHING. BUT TWO BOYS SAT NEXT-TO ME SAID THEY SAW A FLASH OF BLACK... THE NUN! AND ANOTHER TIME MY MUSIC TEACHER STAYED BACK LATE AFTER SCHOOL AND SHE WALKED INTO THE OTHER ROOM DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND SAW THE NUN WATERING THE PLANTS. SHE ALWAYS COMES BACK NOW AND AGAIN TO WATER OUR PLANTS IN THE MUSIC ROOM. BUT HERE'S THE THING... THE PLANTS ARE DEAD BECAUSE SHE'S DEAD.-THERE'S THE PART THAT FREAKS ME OUT. ALL THE TIME.------------------------------------------- LOUISE O'GRADY------------------------------------ TWO YEARS AGO MY DAD AND I WERE DRIVING ACROSS THE SEVERN BRIDGE COMING BACK TO WALES, LLANELLI, WHEN I LOOKED UP AND SAW A PAIR OF LEGS DANCING ON THE BONNET. I'M SURE I SAW IT AND MY DAD SAID HE SAW IT TOO. WE TOLD MY MUM WHEN WE GOT BACK AND SHE TOLD ME MY OLDER SISTER JESSICA WAS RUN OVER BY A CAR JUST OUTSIDE HER COLLEGE, AND HER LEGS WERE TAKEN OFF. IT HAS TAKEN ME TWO YEARS TO TELL ANYONE THIS AS I WAS SO TRAUMATISED BY MY SISTERS ACCIDENT AND MY MUM ALWAYS TOLD ME TO KEEP QUIET ABOUT OUR STRANGE EXPERIENCE. I'M OVER IT NOW BUT WONDERED IF ANYONE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED THIS. THANX SO MUCH FOR ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE ME-, LOUISE O'GRADY XXX------------------------------------------- SHAN FROM MERTHYR------------------------------------ IN THE OLD HOSPITAL IS A GHOST BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING THERE. BUT I HAVE FELT LIKE SOMEONE WAS TOUCHING MY FACE, AND MY FRIEND SAID TO-ME THAT ABOUT 4 MEN WOULD NOT GO-IN THERE BECASE THEY HAVE ALL SEEN GHOSTS.------------------------------------------- RACHAEL. E.- FROM- NEWPORT------------------------------------ I'M AGREEING WITH EMMA NICHOLSON AND STEPH.- THE RED FARM HOUSE IN SAINT FAGANS IS SO CREEPY... I LOVE THE MUSEUM AND ALWAYS USED TO GO THERE WHEN I WAS A KID BUT I ALWAYS REFUSED TO GO UPSTAIRS IN THAT HOUSE.. FREAKY!?------------------------------------------- KIM, USED TO BE LOCAL------------------------------------ FURTHER TO RACHAEL'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE PRINCE OF WALES ESTATE: IN THE MID-80'S SOMEONE WORKING IN THAMES CASE SAW ONE OF THE MINERS FROM THE DISASTER... AND WAS SCARED WITLESS.------------------------------------------- STEPH FROM CAERPHILLY------------------------------------ TO EMMA NICHOLSON, RE: RED HOUSE ST FAGANS - YOU`RE TOTALLY RIGHT, I HAVEN'T BEEN TO ST FAGANS SINCE I WAS SMALL, BUT MY PARENTS RECENTLY TOLD ME IN A "REMINISCING SESSION". FUN, HOW I WOULD NEVER GO IN TO THE RED HOUSE WHEN WE VISITED AND I'D CRY IF THEY TRIED TO TAKE ME IN.-------------------------------------------- RACHEL WALKER FROM CARDIFF------------------------------------ SCHOOLS IN CARDIFF ARE HAUNTED. YEARS AGO A MAN HUNG HIMSELF - HE HAUNTS SCHOOLS. MY MUM SAYS SHE SEES HIM SMOKING A CIGAR. HER FRIENDS SAY THAT TOO AND THEY CAN SMELL HIS TOBACCO.------------------------------------------- SOPHIE FROM CARDIFF------------------------------------ I WAS IN IKEA LAST WEEK PERUSING THE FOOD HALL BIT WHEN I CAME ACROSS A COPY OF TONY ADAM'S BIOGRAPHY 'ADDICTED'LEFT ON A STACK OF DIME BARS. HELD IN PLACE BY AN ELASTIC BAND WAS A SHEET OF PAPER SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THE BOOK COVER WHICH READ 'I AM NOT LOST - SEE INSIDE FOR INSTRUCTIONS'. I GLANCED AROUND ME SUSPICIOUSLY (GAWD KNOWS WHAT FOR EXACTLY) AND THEN HEADED OFF - BEMUSED AND SLIGHTLY SPOOKED BY THE WHOLE THING. HAS ANYONE ELSE SEEN THIS?..AND, YES, I HAVE READ AND ENJOYED MR ADAM'S BOOK.------------------------------------------- TOPCAT, CARDIFF------------------------------------ ST MARY'S CHURCH, ELY. SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE. A GRAVEYARD THAT AT FIRST GLANCE IS WELL KEPT BUT ON LOOKING AGAIN IS DERELICT AND UNKEMPT. A FEELING OF NOT BEING ALONE, AND KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE OUTSTAYED YOUR WELCOME. LEGENDS OF BLACK MASSES AND SUICIDAL PRIESTS DON'T REALLY MAKE FOR A SENSE OF WELL BEING, WHICH IS A SHAME AS ST MARY'S SITS ON AN IRON AGE HILLFORT THAT ALSO HAS REMNANTS OF NORMAN OCCUPATION AND IS SUPPOSEDLY THE CONVERGANCE POINT OF A NUMBER OF LEY LINES. PERHAPS IT'S CONNECTED IN SOME MYSTICAL WAY TO OTHER ANCIENT SITES SUCH AS TINKINSWOOD WHICH ISN'T TOO FAR FROM ELY.- FOR MORE STRANGE STORIES SURROUNDING THE CHURCH CHECK OUT THE SOUTH WALES ECHO AND WESTERN MAIL ARCHIVES. A LOT HAVE BEEN RECORDED. DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE FORT HAS EVER BEEN EXCAVATED AND IF SO WHERE THERE ANY FINDS?------------------------------------------- FELICITY BRAUND FROM CARDIFF------------------------------------ I MUST ADMIT THAT MARK GREMLIN JONES' STORY SEEMS VERY FAR FETCHED! BUT I DO HAVE A STORY ABOUT THAT VERY CEMETERY. MY FRIEND LIVES NEAR BY, SO I WENT ROUND THERE FOR A DRINK (OR TWO!) WHEN I ARRIVED AT HER HOUSE AT AROUND ABOUT HALF PAST 9 AND WENT INTO THE KITCHEN TO GET A BOTTLE OF WINE, I LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE WANDERING AROUND THE GRAVEYARD. MY FRIEND LIVES ON THE NEW ESTATE THERE, SO WE HAD A GOOD VIEW. THIS CONTINUED FOR ABOUT A MINUTE, AND THEN THE FIGURE JUST LITERALLY DISAPPEARED. I AM NOT SURE IF I WAS SEEING THINGS, BUT MY FRIEND'S PRETTY SURE SHE'S SEEN IT A NUMBER OF TIMES! HAVE-YOU?------------------------------------------- JANE SUMFORD FROM- PORTHCAWL------------------------------------ I LIVE OPPOSITE THE NEWLY RE-DONE SKER HOUSE AND I THOUGHT I'D DO A-SPOT OF BIRD WATCHING.- I LOOKED THE HOUSE UP AND DOWN AND THROUGH ONE OF THE WINDOWS I SAW THE MAID OF SKER LOOKING SAD OUT OF THE WINDOW. I LOOKED AGAIN AND SHE WAS GONE-------------------------------------------! TONI M. FROM ESPOO, FINLAND------------------------------------ I'M GLAD THAT I DON'T LIVE IN WALES! SO MANY GHOSTS IN SO MANY PLACES. I SURELY WOULD FEEL UNEASY. THERE AREN'T ANY GHOSTS HERE, I DON'T KNOW WHY. IT'S REALLY AMAZING. NONE OF MY FRIENDS HAVE EVER SEEN A GHOST, APART FROM MY MOM WHO SAW A GHOST IN HER CHILDHOOD HOME IN MANAMANSALO. ON THE SAME ISLAND THEY SAY TWO SONS MURDERED THEIR FATHER. MY COUSIN HAS A CABIN NEAR THAT PLACE AND THE FOREST LOOKS SO EERIE, EVEN IF IT WAS DAYTIME. ALSO ON THE SAME ISLAND (MANAMANSALO IS AN ISLAND) THERE IS AN OLD CEMETERY WHICH DATES BACK FROM C.16TH CENTURY. ACCORDING TO A LEGEND, IN THE END OF 19TH CENTURY A MAN DUG UP SOME BONES HE FOUND AND FOOLED AROUND WITH THEM. SUBSEQUENTLY A GHOST OF A BIG, TALL MAN HAUNTED HIM FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. IN PALTANIEMI THERE WAS ALSO A CEMETERY. HALF OF IT COLLAPSED TO A LAKE CENTURIES AGO AND THE REMAINS OF PEOPLE WERE FLOATINGIN THE LAKE. THE REST OF THE GRAVES WERE DUG UP AND THE BODIES RELOCATED. ONLY HOLES REMAIN IN THE OLD GRAVEYARD. IN KAJAANI AN OLD MANSION CALLED KAROLINEBURG IS SAID TO BE HAUNTED BY A YOUNG LADY. WHEN A PORTRAIT OF HER WAS REMOVED FROM THE BEDROOM A FEW YEARS AGO, MYSTERIOUS FIRES APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE. THEY STOPPED WHEN THE PAINTING WAS HUNG BACK TO ITS OLD PLACE. PEOPLE HAVE ALSO FELT THE PRESENSE OF SOMEONE IN THE-HOUSE. TODAY THE KAROLINEBURG IS A HOTEL AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY STAY IN THE ROOM IF YOU DARE, THAT IS.------------------------------------------- MARK GREMLIN JONES FROM KENFIG HILL------------------------------------ IF YOU GO TO PYLE CHURCH AND SIT IN THE GRAVE YARD, I'VE SEEN THE MAIN ANGEL GRAVESTONE FLY AWAY.---------------------------------------------- ANG FROM CARDIFF------------------------------------ I LIVE IN A 3 STOREY SEMI DETATCHED HOUSE WITH MY PARENTS AND DAUGHTER. OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE HAD SOME STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN. FOOTSTEPS UP/DOWN STAIRS AND HALLWAYS, PLATES FLYING OFF THE DRAINER, SOMEONE PLAYING ON THE POOL TABLE.- MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN BADLY SCRATCHED EVEN THOUGH HER FINGERNAILS ARE ALWAYS SHORT - SHE WANTS TO MOVE AS IT'S FREAKING HER OUT. THINGS GOING MISSING THEN TURNING UP IN THE STRANGEST PLACES. I HAVE BEEN POKED IN THE BACK AND MY FRIEND HAS BEEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD. CUPBOARD DOORS OPENING. MY DOG WILL NOT SLEEP IN THE HOUSE AS HE CRIES AND BARKS WHEN IN. ACCORDING TO THE NEIGHBOURS A MAN WHO LIVED HERE BEFORE COMMITTED SUICIDE. I'M GOING TO THE RECORDS OFFICE TO CHECK PREVIOUS OWNERS OF THE HOUSE THEN CHECK THE NAMES WITH THE DEATH REGISTER. THEN I MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT A NAME TO OUR NON-RENT PAYING GUEST.------------------------------------------- SPOOKED, SOUTH WALES------------------------------------ I USED TO WORK AT LLECHWEN HALL, PONTYPRIDD, FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. I'D ALWAYS BEEN TOLD BY VARIOUS PEOPLE THAT IT HAD A GHOST OR TWO BUT DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IT UNTIL I HAD AN EXPERIENCE THERE MYSELF. IT WAS THE END OF MY WORKING SHIFT. ALL ROOMS UPSTAIRS WERE EMPTY SINCE THE ALL THE RESIDENTS WERE STILL IN THE FUNCTION ROOM. WE WERE WAITING FOR THE ROOM TO EMPTY WHEN MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES HEARD TREMENDOUSLY HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COMING FROM UPSTAIRS. THEY WERE SO HEAVY THAT THE DOOR, WHICH WAS LOCKED, LEADING FROM THE BAR INTO THE FUNCTION ROOM SHOOK VIOLENTLY IN ITS FRAME. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT SOMEONE HAD KICKED THE DOOR, BUT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE SINCE THERE WAS NOBODY NEAR THE DOOR AT THE TIME. MY NEXT THOUGHT WAS THAT SOMEONE WAS RUNNING AROUND UPSTAIRS. I WENT TO RECEPTION TO CHECK IF ANYONE HAD GONE UPSTAIRS. THE OWNER AND 4 OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO WERE IN THE RECEPTION TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NOBODY UPSTAIRS AND THAT THEY HAD HEARD THE FOOTSTEPS TOO-------------------------------------------!! J TAMMY------------------------------------ WHILE ON A VISIT AT THE MANOR, ON A GHOST TOUR I AND MY FAMILY EXPRIENCED STRANGE THINGS, WHILE IN MATTY'S BEDROOM I WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE BED AND MY SAT DAD DOWN ON THE BED I WAS LEANING AGAINST THE BED, THE GUIDE WAS EXPLAINING THE STRANGE HAPPENINGS, MY HAIR WAS LOOSE AND I COULD FEEL SOMEONE PARTING MY HAIR AS IF THEY WERE RUNNING THEIR FINGERS THROUGH IT, IT WAS CHILLING AND DIDN'T WANT TO SAY. AND ALSO MY FATHER WAS MISSING SOME BUTTONS FROM HIS NEW SHIRT WHEN WE LEFT.----------------------------------------------- LINDA GRIFFITHS, MERTHYR TYDFIL------------------------------------- THE A470 ON THE THE WAY TO MERTHYR IS VERY SCARY. MY HUSBAND HAS SEEN A FIGURE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WHEN HE LOOKED BACK THEY HAD DISAPEARED. NOW HE WONT DRIVE PAST THERE BECAUSE HE CANT EXPLAIN WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE GONE SO QUICKLY AND HE THINKS THEY ARE GHOSTS FROM THE ABERFAN DISASTER.-------------------------------------------- PETER FROM NELSON, MID GLAM------------------------------------ I AM 68 YEARS OF AGE AND AS A CHILD VISITED LLANCAIACH FAWR MANY TIMES, AS MY UNCLE WAS A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY - MR---- & MRS WILLIAMS. NEVER EVER ON ANY VISIT 60 YEARS AGO WAS THERE ANY MENTION OF GHOSTS. I THINK IT'S A MONEY MAKING LOAD OF OLD RUBBISH. BUT IT EMPLOYS PEOPLE I SUPPOSE.---------------------------------------------- EVE ORCHARD FROM CARDIFF------------------------------------ ON THE MAIN ROAD BETWEEN NEWPORT AND RISCA, THERE USED TO BE AN OLD DERELICT HOUSE STANDING ALONE IN FIELDS (NOW A HOUSING ESTATE). EVERYTIME I PASSED THERE I SAW A GIRL AT AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW.- SHE WORE A WHITE NIGHTGOWN AND HAD LONG BLACK HAIR. HER ARMS WERE OUTSTRETCHED AND SHE APPEARED TO BE IN DISTRESS, PLEADING FOR HELP. I SENSED THAT SHE WAS LOCKED IN THAT HOUSE AND THAT HER END WOULD BE UNPLEASANT. MY MIND'S EYE TOLD ME THE PERIOD WAS APPROX 16TH CENTURY. I WOULD LOVE TO RESEARCH THAT OLD HOUSE, BUT DON'T KNOW WHERE TO-START. ALSO, I CAN RELATE TO TOMAS COLE FROM NANTYGLO AND HIS EXPERIENCE ON THE MILFRAEN MOUNTAIN. I TOO HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE AT THE SAME PLACE.------------------------------------------- MELISSA SHORTEN FROM PETERSFIELD, HAMPSHIRE------------------------------------ BORN AND BRED IN CARDIFF I WORKED AS A SATURDAY GIRL IN ALLDERS.- TO BRING CHINA UP FROM THE CELLARS TO BE SOLD WE HAD TO CLIMB DOWN ABOUT 4 SETS OF SOLID STONE STAIRS TO THE BASEMENT WHICH WAS AT ONE TIME THE EMBALMING CHAMBERS OF ST JOHNS CHURCH (OPPOSITE THE MARKET).- I WAS ALWAYS FOLLOWED DOWN THOSE STAIRS BY AN ANGRY LITTLE MAN, MUMBLING AWAY TO HIMSELF WITH A LANTERN ON A STICK.-- I HATED GOING DOWN THERE.------------------------------------------- VICKY AND CARLY FROM OGMORE VALE------------------------------------ WE WENT ON A TRIP TO VISIT LLANCAIACH FAWR ABOUT 2 YRS AGO WITH OUR SCHOOL. WHEN WE WERE TALKING OUTSIDE THE MANOR, A STRANGE DARK SHADOW PASSED THE KITCHEN WINDOW, AND-WHEN WE WALKED AROUND INSIDE THE BUILDING WE HAD THE FEELING SOMEONE OR SOMETHING WAS FOLLOWING US. IT WAS DEAD SCARY BUT EXCITING! IF YOU WANT TO SEE A GHOST, I SUGGEST YOU GO THERE..-------------------------------------------- JO FROM CARDIFF------------------------------------ I USED TO WORK IN THE ODEON CINEMAS IN CARDIFF, AND THE OLDER OF THE TWO IN QUEEN STREET GAVE WEIRD VIBES.- NOT BAD FEELINGS BUT THE FEELING OF NOT BEING ALONE, AND THE SMELL OF LAVENDER WAS QUITE STRONG AROUND ONE PARTICULAR SEAT IN THE UPSTAIRS SCREEN.------------------------------------------- TOMAS COLE FROM NANTYGLO------------------------------------ I WAS UP THE MILFRAEN MOUNTAIN WHEN FROM WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A TREE - A GHOSTLY FIGURE OF A MAN WITH A HOOD AND A LONG COAT CASUALLY WALKED TOWARDS ME. FROM THAT DAY THE MILFRAEN HAS BEEN VERY UNSETTLING FOR ME AND MY MATES.------------------------------------------- MARTINE FROM CARDIFF------------------------------------ MANY YEARS AGO, MYSELF AND A GROUP OF MY SCHOOL FRIENDS USE TO HANG ABOUT IN THIS OLD DERELICT HOUSE CALLED "QUARRY HOUSE". IT WAS A MASSIVE OLD HOUSE,AND IT WAS REALLY SPOOKY.- I ALWAYS FELT A BREEZE ON THE BACK OF MY NECK, AND MY MATE SAID SHE SEEN A FIGURE OF A MAN WATCHING HER.- BUT IT WAS LIKE HE WAS DRESSED IN BLACK.- I NEVER WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AFTER THAT - IT IS NOW A NURSING HOME--------------------------------------------! CLAIRE FROM LLANTWIT MAJOR------------------------------------ SOMEONE SHOULD CHECK OUT THE OLD SWAN INN IN LLANTWIT MAJOR. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF GHOSTS, AND UNDERGROUND TUNNELS CONNECTING THE PUBS, CHURCH AND GREAT HOUSE......CREEPY.------------------------------------------- BARRY JOHN FROM NANTYGLOW------------------------------------ I WAS AT THE PARK ONE DAY WITH MY FRIENDS HAVING A TALK, AND WE THEN STARTED TALKING ABOUT GHOSTS AND I MENSIONED TO ONE OF MY FRIENDS THAT I COULD MAKE CONTACT WITH THE DEAD. THEY DIDN'T BELIVE ME AT FIRST UNTIL I STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIER PASSED-ON RELATIVES. THIS WAS ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO NOW AND I AM 24 NOW AND CAN'T CONTACT THE DEAD ANY MORE, BUT I'LL-NEVER FORGET THE DAY DOWN THE PARK TEN YEARS AGO.------------------------------------------- RHODRI FROM PORTHCAWL------------------------------------ WHILE LIVING AT 78 COWBRIDGE ROAD WEST, ELY, CARDIFF MY PARTNER AND I REPEATEDLY EXPERIENCED BAD ATMOSPHERES COLD SPOTS AND GENERAL BAD FEELING IN THE UPSTAIRS BACK ROOM. HAIRS ON MY NECK ARE UP NOW JUST THINKING ABOUT IT, BRRR.- HAD A PRIEST IN TO SAY PRAYERS, WORKED FOR A WHILE BUT STILL A TERRIBLE BAD FEELING THERE. ANYONE KNOW IF ANYTHING'S HAPPENED THERE?------------------------------------------- SOPHIE FROM PENARTH------------------------------------ I HAVE HAD SOME VERY ODD EXPERIENCES IN MY BRAND NEW HOUSE ON THE COGAN HALL FARM DEVELOPMENT FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER OF RECURRING DREAMS-ABOUT A MAN WHO SHOOTS HIMSELF...CAN ANYONE TELL ME IF SOMETHING HAPPENED HERE?------------------------------------------- SAM 'N' ZACK FROM BRISTOL------------------------------------ IN THE RHYMNEY HOUSE HOTEL, THERE IS A GHOST OF A MAID SERVANT WHO KILLED HERSELF WHEN SHE FOUND SHE WAS EXPECTING-A BABY.------------------------------------------- JASON HAWKINS FROM ABERDARE------------------------------------ I WAS TRAVELLING THROUGH NELSON 2 DAYS AGO - I REMEMBER THE TIME DISTINCTIVELY 3.30AM.

I WAS THE LAST PERSON IN OUR GROUP AND WAS HANGING BACK WITH MY BOYFRIEND TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THINGS, I FELT FINGERS TICKLING MY BACK QUITE PLAYFULLY, I LAUGHED AND TURNED AROUND EXPECTING MY BOYFRIEND TO BE THERE.- HE WASN'T - JUST BLACKNESS GREETED ME I TURNED AROUND AND SAW THAT HE WAS IN FRONT OF ME. THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED - A GHOSTLY TOUCH TO FEEL LIKE, THEY FELT SO REAL...------------------------------------------- LYNNE FROM PENCOED------------------------------------ WHILST LIVING IN A FLAT IN HARLOW, YEARS AGO, I ALWAYS FELT I WAS NOT ALONE.- ONE NIGHT I WOKE UP AND FELT THERE WAS SOMEONE (OTHER THAN MY HUSBAND) IN THE ROOM.- I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I SCREWED MY EYES SHUT AND HID UNDER THE COVERS.- WHEN I CAME OUT THERE WAS A MAN (NOT MY HUSBAND!) SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE BED WITH AN OLD FASHIONED RUFFLED SHIRT ON AND LONG HAIR. HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID "DON'T BE FRIGHTENED, I'M NOT HERE TO SCARE YOU-" THEN STOOD UP AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM. FROM THEN ON I STILL FELT A PRESENCE BUT DID NOT SEE HIM AGAIN. THIS IS THE ONLY TIME THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME AND WAS OVER 20 YEARS AGO! - I WAS NOT DRUNK OR DREAMING-------------------------------------------! CHARLOTTE FROM CAERPHILLY------------------------------------ MY HOUSE IS HAUNTED BY TWO GHOSTS, ONE A WOMAN THAT GLOWS GREEN AND THE OTHER MY FATHER. HE PLAYS MUSIC IN MY ROOM AND CREATES SMELLS OF BURNING WOOD, FIREWORKS AND MANY OTHERS. SHE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY OF MY ROOM AND LOOKS AT ME FOR AROUND 15 MINUTES AT A TIME. I SOMETIMES THINK SHE'S TRYINY TO TELL ME SOMETHING, AND I HOPE ONE DAY I'LL FIND OUT SINCE I'M PARTLY PSYCHIC.------------------------------------------- CERI FROM ELY------------------------------------ MY NAN ONCE TOLD ME YEARS AGO MY UNCLE WAS OUT WALKING VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING NEAR ST. MARY'S CHURCH. HE HAS NEVER BEEN AFRAID OF THIS PLACE AS HIS SISTER WAS THE LAST PERSON TO MARRY HERE - SO HE ONLY HAD HAPPY MEMORIES OF HOW IT ONCE WAS.-- WHAT HE SAW CHANGED ALL THAT. HE SAW A MONK COME FLOATING FROM BEHIND THE CHURCH, GO TO AN OLD WATERING HOLE, STOP, LOOK DOWN AND THEN FLOAT BACK TO BEHIND THE CHURCH. HE RAN HOME WHITE AS A SHEET AND HAS NOT BEEN NEAR THE PLACE SINCE, AND WILL NOT TALK ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE.--------------------------------------------- REV CHRISTOPHER TREFOR DAVIES FROM MAESTEG------------------------------------ HOWELLS STORE CARDIFF WHERE A BAPTIST WAS BURNED TO DEATH FOR BEING A BAPTIST.

STEVE BAINES FROM CARDIFF------------------------------------ UNLIKE MR PROSSER FROM LISVANE, THE ONLY TIMES I GET A COLD FEELING IN THE PIT OF MY TUMMY IN HOWELLS IS WHEN I SEE THE PRICE OF WHAT THE WIFE IS WALKING OFF TO THE TILLS WITH...OR WHEN I REALISE AN OLDER GENTLEMAN HAS DELIBERATELY FOLLOWED ME INTO THE CUSTOMER TOILETS!! SPOOKY OR WHAT?------------------------------------------- ALAIN PROSSER JONES FROM LISVANE, CARDIFF------------------------------------ PERHAPS I AM SILLY, BUT I ALWAYS GET A STRANGE COLD FEELING IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH WHEN I AM CLOSE TO THE REMAINS OF THE OLD CHURCH INCORPORATED INTO THE STRUCTURE OF HOWELLS DEPARTMENT STORE IN CARDIFF. WAS IT NOT ON THIS SPOT THAT SOMEONE WAS BURNED FOR HERESY IN THE 16TH CENTURY?-------------------------------------------- DAFYDD AP TUDOR IN COWBRIDGE------------------------------------ I CONCEDE THE PRINCE AT KENFIG IS SPOOKY AT TIMES AS CAN BE THE ANGEL INN IN MAUDLAM AT TIMES. HOWEVER MOST GHOST STORIES ABOUT SKER WERE MADE UP BY VARIOUS INHABITANTS---- & ASSOSIATES TO KEEP AWAY THE LOCALS. THIS PLACE WAS A SMUGGLING SHIP WRECKERS DEN OF THEIVES DESPITE THE GRANDEUR OF ITS FACADE--------------------------------------------! MARK FORESTER FROM NORTH CORNELLY------------------------------------ THE PRINCE OF WALES AT TON KENFIG (ABOUT 2 MILES FROM SKER). LIKE ALL GOOD PUBS IT'S REPUTED TO BE HAUNTED. IT'S THE FORMER TOWN HALL OF THE FORMER TOWN OF KENFIG (A LARGE TOWN ALMOST TOTALLY DESTROYED IN THE 16TH CENTURY BY VIOLENT STORMS!!!). AS A SCEPTIC EVEN I HAVE FELT A STRANGE PRESENCE IN THE PLACE ON A FEW OCCASIONS. HOWEVER IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE OTHER TYPE OF SPIRIT THAT CAUSED THEM-------------------------------------------! KERRY MORGAN------------------------------------ I AGREE WITH CHAD PEARCE THERE ARE LOADS OF STORIES ABOUT SKER HOUSE---- & SOME MAY HAVE FOUNDATION, ESPECIALLY GIVEN ITS HISTORY. HOWEVER JODIE'S TALE SEEMS A LITTLE FAR FETCHED. WHO WALKS ACROSS MILES OF UNLIT SANDDUNES IN THE EARLY HOURS?(UNLESS THEY TRESSPASED---- & TOOK A SHORT CUT!) WHAT DID THEY HOPE TO CATCH? USE WORMS NOT SCOTCH AS BAIT.-------------------------------------------- ANDREW EVANS FROM ABERTRIDWR------------------------------------ IN GROES WEN THERE IS AN ABANDONED FARM HOUSE NEAR THE LANE. ME AND MATES WERE MESSING ABOUT WITH A CAMCORDER JUST BELOW THE GROUNDS, TRYING TO MAKE A VIDEO. WHEN WE GOT HOME AND WATCHED IT, THERE IS AN ORB HOVERING ABOVE OUR HEADS.

IT WAS DARK AND IT WAS MY TURN TO SEEK. I SAW WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT IN THE FORM OF WOMAN WITH A LONG FLOWING TRAIN BEHIND HER GLIDING DIAGONALLY FROM THE OLD MILL FOOTBRIDGE TOWARDS ABERTRIDWR PARK. IT WAS QUITE SCARY AT THE TIME BUT I PUT IT DOWN TO MY IMAGINATION. RECENTLY I SPOKE TO MY BOYFRIEND ABOUT THE EVENT. HE TOLD ME THAT HE AND HIS FRIEND SAW THE EXACT SAME THING WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER. SPOOKY--------------------------------------------! GEMMA JOSEPH FROM CARDIFF------------------------------------ STAFF AT THE ANCHOR INN, TINTERN, HAVE BEEN SCARED OUT OF THEIR WITS OVER THE YEARS.
