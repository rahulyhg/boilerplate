UP DISARMAMENT AND CONVERSION EVENTS------------------------------------- ARMS CONTROL IN CRISIS AND DISARMAMENT AT A TURNING POINT?--------------------------- TODAY INDICATORS FOR DISARMAMENT AND CONVERSION SIGNAL STAGNATION--------------- OR EVEN A REVERSAL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A DECADE. IT SEEMS--------------- THAT DISARMAMENT IS AT A TURNING POINT: ARMS CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS--------------- ARE IN A CRISIS; EFFORTS AT CONFLICT PREVENTION AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION--------------- ARE A MIXED BAG OF SUCCESSES AND FAILURES; AND CONVERSION HAS SLOWED--------------- DOWN. DESPITE-THIS THERE IS STILL MUCH CONVERSION WORK AHEAD, ESPECIALLY--------------- IN REINTEGRATING DEMOBILIZED ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL AND REDUNDANT--------------- DEFENSE INDUSTRY WORKERS IN EASTERN EUROPE AS WELL AS IN MILITARY--------------- BASE REDEVELOPMENT.------------------- THIS INTRODUCTION WILL LOOK AT THE REASONS FOR THE CRISIS IN ARMS--------------- CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS, WILL SUMMARIZE THE FINDINGS OF DISARMAMENT--------------- AND CONVERSION TRENDS, WILL DRAW ATTENTION-TO ONGOING WARS AND CONFLICT--------------- RESOLUTION EFFORTS AS WELL AS TO THE PREVAILING TREND OF OPTING--------------- FOR A MILITARY SOLUTION TO CONFLICTS, AND WILL, FINALLY, DRAW CONCLUSIONS---------------, IDENTIFYING POSSIBLE FUTURE WAYS OF REVITALIZING THE DISARMAMENT--------------- AND CONVERSION PROCESS.-------------------------------------------- CRISIS IN ARMS CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS-------------------------------------------------------- A NUMBER OF FAILED OR STAGNATING NEGOTIATIONS ON WEAPONS OF MASS--------------- DESTRUCTION SYMBOLIZE THE DEPTH OF THE CRISIS IN INTERNATIONAL ARMS--------------- CONTROL. BUT PARADOXICALLY, UP TO NOW, THE CRISIS OF INSTITUTIONALIZED--------------- (NEGOTIATED--ARMS CONTROL HAS NOT-LED TO THE COMPLETE END OF DISARMAMENT.--------------- ARMS CONTROL OF THE CLASSICAL TYPE BETWEEN OPPOSING BLOCS OF MILITARY--------------- ALLIANCES HAS BEEN IN CRISIS SINCE THE MID-NINETIES. HOWEVER, IN--------------- CONTRAST TO--- NEGOTIATED---- ARMS CONTROL, DISARMAMENT CAN BE CARRIED--------------- OUT EITHER ON THE BASIS OF AN ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENT, OR UNILATERALLY.--------------- DISARMAMENT REDUCES MILITARY FORCES NUMERICALLY (WEAPONS, MILITARY--------------- PERSONNEL, ETC.) AND/OR MILITARY POWER AND RENDERS CONVERSION NECESSARY:--------------- AS LONG AS FINANCIAL, HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCES ARE BEING FREED--------------- FROM THE MILITARY SECTOR, THERE IS ALSO A NEED TO CONVERT THEM IN--------------- ORDER TO AVOID UNNECESSARY SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC EFFECTS OR ADVERSE--------------- POLITICAL REACTIONS.-------------------- DESPITE THE HIGHLY VISIBLE GRIDLOCK IN ARMS CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS---------------, GOVERNMENTS HAVE REDUCED-THEIR MILITARY FORCES SUBSTANTIALLY: WEAPON--------------- SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DECOMMISSIONED, TROOPS DEMOBILIZED, ARMS PRODUCTION--------------- CAPACITIES REDUCED, MILITARY BASES REDEVELOPED FOR NON-MILITARY--------------- PURPOSES, AND MILITARY EXPENDITURES CUT. THE NUMERICAL REDUCTION--------------- OF MILITARY FORCES HAS ACTUALLY BEEN HAPPENING UNTIL RECENTLY AND--------------- IS CONTINUING IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AND IN CERTAIN SECTORS, BUT--------------- THE YEAR 2000 MAY PROVE TO BE A TURNING POINT IN NUMERICAL, QUANTITATIVE--------------- DISARMAMENT.------------------- HOW SERIOUS IS THE DECOUPLING OF ACTUAL DISARMAMENT FROM INSTITUTIONALIZED--------------- ARMS CONTROL? WILL GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO DISARM UNILATERALLY AND--------------- CONVERT MILITARY RESOURCES TO NON-MILITARY USE AS THEY DID IN THE--------------- SECOND HALF OF THE NINETIES OR WILL THIS DECOUPLING PROCESS PUT--------------- AN END TO DISARMAMENT AND CONVERSION? WHAT CAN ARMS CONTROL DO TO--------------- CURB THE CURRENTLY PREVAILING INTRA-STATE ARMED CONFLICTS AND HOW--------------- EFFECTIVELY CAN IT DO THIS? WHAT PRIORITIES ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE--------------- ARMS CONTROL A FACILITATOR OF FUTURE DISARMAMENT AND CONVERSION?------------------- DESPITE THE CRISIS IN ARMS CONTROL THERE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL--------------- ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS. ARGUABLY, THE MOST IMPORTANT---------------------- ONE--------------- WAS-THE EXTENSION OF THE-NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY (NPT) IN MAY 1995 ---------------AND THE NPT REVIEW CONFERENCE IN APRIL/MAY------ UNFORTUNATELY---------------, THIS-SUCCESS STORY IS CALLED INTO QUESTION BY THE ACTUAL BEHAVIOR--------------- OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES, WHO HAVE NOT COME TO TERMS ON A COMPREHENSIVE--------------- TEST BAN OR A FISSILE MATERIAL-BAN--LET ALONE COMPLETE NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT-A--------------- REQUIREMENT OF THE NPT. ANOTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT WAS THE OTTAWA CONVENTION--------------- BANNING ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES, WHICH TOOK PLACE OUTSIDE THE CLASSICAL--------------- FORUMS OF ARMS CONTROL. SIMILAR EFFORTS STIMULATED BY THE LANDMINE--------------- CONVENTION ARE NOW BEING UNDERTAKEN TO CONTROL THE PROLIFERATION--------------- AND EXCESSIVE ACCUMULATION OF SMALL ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS.------------------------------------------------ TWO ASPECTS UNDERLYING THE CRISIS OF TRADITIONAL--------------- ARMS CONTROL REQUIRE PARTICULAR ATTENTION: THE INCREASING MILITARY--------------- DOMINANCE OF THE UNITED STATES; AND CHANGED PERCEPTIONS OF MILITARY--------------- THREATS.---------------------------------------------------------------- HEGEMONIC SUPERPOWER-------------------------------------------------------------- MANY POST-COLD WAR ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS--------------- WERE MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE SOVIET UNION, AND LATER RUSSIA, WERE--------------- IN A WEAK POSITION. THE POSSIBLE REVITALIZATION OF RUSSIA WAS SEEN--------------- IN THE UNITED STATES AND NATO AS A REALISTIC OPTION. REDUCTIONS--------------- IN MILITARY POSTURES BOTH IN NATO AND IN RUSSIA WERE THEREFORE PERCEIVED--------------- AS MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL. BUT WITH THE CONTINUING DISINTEGRATION OF--------------- THE RUSSIAN MILITARY AND THE OBVIOUS LOSS OF RUSSIA-S STATUS AS--------------- A MILITARY SUPERPOWER--THE US INTEREST IN STRATEGIC STABILITY THROUGH--------------- BILATERAL ARMS CONTROL DIMINISHED; THE-BILATERAL SUPERPOWER RELATIONS--------------- SHIFTED TO A CLEAR AND GROWING US DOMINANCE. INCREASINGLY, WITH--------------- THE SOVIET THREAT GONE, THE UNITED STATES BELIEVES IT CAN CONTROL--------------- SMALLER STATES MILITARILY, EVEN IF THESE STATES AIM AT NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES--------------- OR OTHER TYPES OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. THE US CONCEPT IS--------------- INCREASINGLY FOCUSING ON LIMITING THE WEAPON SYSTEMS OF OTHER COUNTRIES--------------- WITHOUT LIMITING ITS OWN ROOM FOR ACTION AS THE ONLY GLOBAL MILITARY--------------- POWER. THIS IS MOST CLEARLY ILLUSTRATED BY ITS PLANS FOR A NATIONAL--------------- MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.------------------------------------------------ THIS POLICY HAS LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. THE--------------- LIMITS OF CLASSICAL ARMS CONTROL DEMONSTRATE THE LOGIC OF THE WELL-KNOWN--------------- SECURITY DILEMMA. WHEREVER A HEGEMONY EXISTS OR ARMAMENTS ARE ASYMMETRICALLY--------------- DISTRIBUTED, ARMS CONTROL IS LIKELY TO COME TO A STAND-STILL. THE---------------- HAVES- DO NOT SEE AN INCENTIVE TO GIVE UP THEIR SUPERIOR POSITION---------------, AND STIMULATE ARMS ACQUISITION AMONG THE- HAVE-NOTS- JUST BY DEFENDING--------------- THEIR SUPERIORITY. NEVERTHELESS, UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT OR REGIONAL--------------- CONFIDENCE-BUILDING CAN CREATE TRUST AND MAY INSTILL A SENSE OF--------------- ASSURANCE, SPILLING OVER INTO FURTHER ROUNDS OF ARMS CONTROL- (DISARMAMENT--------------- SPILL-OVER-). IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO JUDGE WHETHER THE DISARMAMENT--------------- OF THE NINETIES WILL PROVE TO BE SELF-SUSTAINING OR WILL BE REVERSED---------------, AS SOME INDICATORS TEND TO SUGGEST.---------------------------------------------------------------- NEW MILITARY THREATS: NEW--------------- FORMS OF ARMS CONTROL------------------------------------------------ MANY COUNTRIES HAVE STARTED TO REASSESS MILITARY--------------- THREATS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR ARMED FORCES.--------------- THE NUMBER OF LONG-RANGE MILITARY INTERVENTIONS HAS INCREASED. MULTILATERAL--------------- UN PEACE-KEEPING MISSIONS HAVE MOVED TO CENTER STAGE IN THE DISCUSSION--------------- OF NEW AND FUTURE MILITARY MISSIONS. REGIONAL AND INTERNAL WARS--------------- HAVE BECOME THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION. THIS HAS NOT ONLY ENTAILED PREPARATION ---------------FOR SUCH MISSIONS, BUT ALSO REQUIRED THAT THE WEAPONS PRIMARILY--------------- USED IN SUCH WARS--LANDMINES, SMALL ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS- BE PLACED--------------- ON THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS CONTROL AGENDA.------------------------------------------------ CLASSICAL ARMS CONTROL, AS IT DEVELOPED DURING--------------- THE COLD WAR, HAS PROVED INADEQUATE FOR THE NEW SITUATION. CLEARLY---------------, THE CENTRAL PROBLEM IN WARS OF TODAY IS NOT THE LACK OF INTERNATIONAL--------------- STABILITY BUT THE DESTRUCTIVENESS OF THE WEAPONS AND THEIR ENORMOUS--------------- COST. THE MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE OF THE EMERGING REORIENTATION OF--------------- ARMS CONTROL ARE THE NEGOTIATIONS OF THE LANDMINE CONVENTION: THE--------------- PRACTICE OF HOLDING ON TO CERTAIN TYPES OR NUMBERS OF WEAPON SYSTEMS--------------- BY SUCH------- COUNTRIES AS THE UNITED STATES, RUSSIA, CHINA AND--------------- INDIA IS TYPICAL OF CLASSICAL ARMS CONTROL, BUT TO THE MAJORITY--------------- OF COUNTRIES WHO BECAME PARTY TO THE CONVENTION, THIS WAS UNACCEPTABLE.---------------- LIKE-MINDED STATES- SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATED THE LANDMINE TREATY--------------- IN A NEW FORUM, LABELED THE- OTTAWA PROCESS-. CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS-NGOS---------------- BECAME A NEW ACTOR IN ARMS CONTROL. THE NEW COMBINATION OF- LIKE-MINDED---------------- GOVERNMENTS AND A DIVERSIFIED NETWORK OF NATIONALLY OR INTERNATIONALLY--------------- OPERATING NGOS WHO MADE THIS TREATY POSSIBLE IS THE ONLY GUARANTEE--------------- FOR COMPLIANCE.------------------- THERE IS NO REASON TO BE OVERENTHUSIASTIC. MANY STATES-MINE PRODUCERS--------------- AS WELL AS MINE USERS, FROM THE UNITED STATES TO YUGOSLAVIA, FROM--------------- RUSSIA TO PAKISTAN, FROM CHINA TO BURMA-ARE NOT PARTY TO THE CONVENTION.--------------- EVEN STATES WHO--- ARE---- PARTY TO THE CONVENTION HAVE CONTINUED--------------- TO PLANT ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES. NON-COMPLIANCE IS NOT PUNISHED. CERTAIN--------------- TYPES OF MINES WHICH ARE DANGEROUS TO PEOPLE ARE NOT PROHIBITED.--------------- MOREOVER, ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN STIMULATED--------------- BY THE LANDMINE TREATY IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT ITS PROVISIONS. WHETHER--------------- SIMILAR TREATIES ARE ATTAINABLE, FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AREA OF SMALL--------------- ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS, WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY THE 2001 UN CONFERENCE--------------- ON THE- ILLEGAL TRADE IN SMALL ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS IN ALL ITS--------------- ASPECTS-. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM, SMALL ARMS CONTROL--------------- HAS ENORMOUS SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT. YET THE CREDIBILITY OF BOTH--------------- EXPORTING AS WELL AS IMPORTING COUNTRIES COULD BE IMPROVED IF THE--------------- PRESENT POLITICAL DECLARATIONS ARE UNDERPINNED BY STRICTER REGULATIONS--------------- CONCERNING THE MOVEMENTS OF SMALL ARMS.-------------------------------------- BICC FINDINGS: DISARMAMENT AT A TURNING POINT?--------------------------------- DISARMAMENT IS EASIER THAN ARMS CONTROL. EACH GOVERNMENT CAN UNILATERALLY--------------- DECIDE TO DISARM AND NEED NOT WAIT FOR ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS.--------------- THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT MANY STATES DID DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE--------------- EIGHTIES AND PARTICULARLY DURING THE NINETIES-AND IS CONFIRMED BY--------------- BICC-S MEASURE OF DISARMAMENT AND THE POTENTIAL FOR CONVERSION---------------, THE BICC CONVERSION, DISARMAMENT, DEMILITARIZATION AND DEMOBILIZATION--------------- (BIC3D) INDEX. THIS GIVES A VALUE OF 30 FOR THE WORLD IN 1999, INDICATING----------------THAT MILITARY SECTORS HAD SHRUNK BY 30 PERCENT WORLDWIDE BETWEEN--------------- THE TRANSITION PHASE AROUND THE END OF THE COLD WAR AND------------------------- DESPITE THIS HISTORICALLY UNIQUE REDUCTION IN ARMS, MILITARY FORCES--------------- ARE STILL ENORMOUS. GLOBAL MILITARY EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED TO--------------- HAVE AMOUNTED TO US $686 BILLION IN 1999 (IN PRICES OF 1993); THE--------------- PRESENT-STOCK OF MAJOR CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS IS STILL OVER--------------- 422,000 PIECES; 21.7 MILLION MILITARY TROOPS STILL SERVE IN THE WORLD-S--------------- ARMED FORCES; AND ALMOST 8 MILLION EMPLOYEES WORK IN THE ARMS INDUSTRY.--------------- THUS, ALMOST 30 MILLION PEOPLE STILL EARN THEIR LIVING DIRECTLY--------------- AND FULLY IN THE MILITARY SECTOR.------------------- FURTHERMORE, HIGH-RISK STRATEGIES IN THE FIELD OF WEAPONS OF MASS--------------- DESTRUCTION ARE STILL APPLIED.-------------------------------------- MILITARY EXPENDITURES-GROWING AGAIN:----------------------------- AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF DECLINE, GLOBAL MILITARY EXPENDITURES--------------- WERE ON THE RISE AGAIN IN------ THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT REVERSES A--------------- TREND THAT HAS SEEN A DRASTIC REDUCTION IN MILITARY EXPENDITURES--------------- AND CLEARLY SIGNALS A HALT, OR EVEN A REVERSAL, OF DISARMAMENT AND--------------- CONVERSION. ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES ARE STILL CONTINUING--------------- TO REDUCE THEIR MILITARY EXPENDITURES, SOME OF THE BIGGER SPENDERS--------------- SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES, FRANCE, GERMANY, CHINA, RUSSIA, BRAZIL--------------- AND AUSTRALIA INCREASED OR ANNOUNCED THE GROWTH OF THEIR EXPENDITURES--------------- IN-------------------------------------------- 1999/MILITARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT- ANTI-CYCLICAL--------------- TRENDS:-------------- GLOBAL EXPENDITURES ON MILITARY RESEARCH AND--------------- DEVELOPMENT WERE NOT AS STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE SHARP DECREASES--------------- IN THE EARLY NINETIES AS OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET. WHILE MILITARY--------------- R----&D EXPENDITURES IN RUSSIA WERE REDUCED DRAMATICALLY, THOSE--------------- IN WESTERN MARKET ECONOMIES ONLY SHRANK SLIGHTLY. DURING THE PERIOD--------------- OF REDUCED DEFENSE PRODUCTION IN THE NINETIES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF--------------- NEW WEAPON TECHNOLOGIES AND WEAPON SYSTEMS WAS PRIORITIZED TO PRESERVE--------------- TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES. R----&D SEEMS TO HAVE DONE THE JOB OF--------------- BRIDGING A PERIOD OF REDUCED PROCUREMENT. WITH THE REVERSAL IN MILITARY--------------- EXPENDITURES DESCRIBED ABOVE, R----&D EFFORTS ARE SLOWING DOWN.--------------- THIS COULD, IN TURN, MEAN NEW DEMAND FOR CONVERSION AT MILITARY--------------- LABS.-------------------------------------- INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND CONVERSION- CONTINUED--------------- INTERNATIONALIZATION AT A HIGHER LEVEL OF PRODUCTION:------- AFTER--------------- THE RAPID WORLDWIDE DECREASE IN MILITARY PRODUCTION, THERE IS NOW--------------- INDICATION THAT THE DECREASE HAS NOT ONLY SLOWED DOWN AND STOPPED--------------- IN RECENT YEARS BUT MIGHT HAVE ALREADY BEEN REVERSED. AT LEAST IN--------------- SOME OF THE MAJOR ARMS-PRODUCING COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES---------------, FRANCE, THE UNITED KINGDOM, RUSSIA AND JAPAN, PRODUCTION HAS INCREASED--------------- AGAIN. UNLIKE PRODUCTION, HOWEVER, EMPLOYMENT IN THE ARMS INDUSTRY--------------- HAS CONTINUED TO DECREASE. AFTER A NUMBER OF MEGA-MERGERS IN PREVIOUS--------------- YEARS, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE LARGE ARMS COMPANIES IN THE UNITED--------------- STATES, ATTENTION HAS NOW TURNED TO INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AGREEMENTS--------------- AND ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY SECTOR, THIS PROCESS--------------- OF GLOBALIZATION IS MUCH LESS ADVANCED THAN IN MANY OTHER INDUSTRIAL--------------- SECTORS. WHILE CONVERSION AND DIVERSIFICATION OF DEFENSE PRODUCTION--------------- CONTINUES IN SMALLER COMPANIES WITHOUT MUCH PUBLIC ATTENTION, LARGER--------------- COMPANIES TEND TO CONCENTRATE ON THEIR CORE DEFENSE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.-------------------------------------- DEMOBILIZATION AND REINTEGRATION- THE NEED FOR--------------- COOPERATION WITH OTHER PROGRAMS:-------------- THE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS--------------- WORLD-WIDE HAS CONTINUED TO DECLINE FOR THE TENTH YEAR RUNNING---------------, ALTHOUGH THE PROCESS HAS ALSO SLOWED DOWN. FROM THE PEAK OF 28.---------------8 MILLION IN 1987, IT WAS DOWN TO 21.7 MILLION IN------ WHILE SOME--------------- COUNTRIES (RUSSIA, GERMANY) HAVE PLANS FOR FURTHER CUTS IN THEIR--------------- ARMED FORCES, DEMOBILIZATION PROGRAMS ARE STILL ONGOING IN OTHERS---------------, PARTICULARLY AS A RESULT OF POST-WAR RATIONALIZATION (AS IN CAMBODIA---------------, EAST TIMOR AND SIERRA LEONE). SIMILAR PROGRAMS WILL BE REQUIRED--------------- IF PEACE AGREEMENTS ARE REACHED IN OTHER COUNTRIES. MOST POST-WAR--------------- DEMOBILIZATION PROGRAMS ARE CONDUCTED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH, OR AS--------------- AN INTEGRAL PART OF, A MORE GENERAL REFORM OF THE SECURITY SECTOR--------------- WHICH INCLUDES THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE ARMED FORCES. IN RECENT--------------- YEARS, ACTORS IN DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION HAVE RECOGNIZED THE FACT----------------THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER EXCLUDE SECURITY ISSUES, BUT MUST ADDRESS--------------- THEM AS PART OF A STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.-------------------------------------- BASE CLOSURE AND REDEVELOPMENT- LONG-TERM REDEVELOPMENT--------------- TASKS STILL AHEAD:-------------- THE RESTRUCTURING PROCESSES OF--------------- ARMED FORCES WORLDWIDE HAVE GREATLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF MILITARY--------------- BASES. THIS HAS BEEN HEAVILY CONCENTRATED ON EUROPE AS WELL AS ON--------------- A LIMITED NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ELSEWHERE (AUSTRALIA, PANAMA, THE--------------- PHILIPPINES, SOUTH AFRICA--THE UNITED STATES AND VIETNAM). A LARGE--------------- ARRAY OF BASES FREED BY THE MILITARY STILL NEED TO BE REDEVELOPED---------------, AND NEW CIVIL-ECONOMIC USAGE NEEDS-TO BE IDENTIFIED. FURTHERMORE, ---------------IT CAN BE EXPECTED THAT ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF FORCE RESTRUCTURING---------------, RATIONALIZATION OR DEMILITARIZATION PROCESSES WILL CREATE NEW TASKS--------------- FOR BASE REDEVELOPMENT (FOR EXAMPLE IN GERMANY, NORTHERN IRELAND---------------, RUSSIA, SOUTH AFRICA AND THE UNITED STATES).-------------------------------------- SURPLUS WEAPONS-POLITICAL DECLARATIONS HAVE--------------- TO BE FOLLOWED BY ACTION NOW:-------------- THE SLOWING PACE OF--------------- NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT HAS INCREASED THE RISK OF PROLIFERATION OF ALL--------------- WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. WHILE THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR NEW CONVENTIONAL--------------- ARMS SHRANK AFTER THE POLITICAL CHANGES OF 1989/90, THE ARMS INDUSTRY--------------- HAS BEEN SUSTAINED BY AN EXPANDED MARKET FOR THE UPGRADING OF USED--------------- WEAPONS. FROM 1990 ONWARDS, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ARMORED VEHICLES---------------, WARSHIPS, MISSILES AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT HELD BY ALL STATES IN THE--------------- WORLD FELL CONTINUOUSLY. BY 1999, IT WAS ALMOST 30 PERCENT LOWER.--------------- NEW INITIATIVES TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF CONTEMPORARY WARS, SUCH--------------- AS THE CAMPAIGNS AGAINST LANDMINES AND SMALL ARMS, HAVE HAD SOME--------------- SUCCESS IN THEIR OWN TERMS. THE ISSUE HAS BECOME HIGH ON THE INTERNATIONAL--------------- POLICY AGENDA. PARTLY IN RESPONSE TO THE GROWING PRESSURE FROM CIVIL--------------- SOCIETY, GOVERNMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY ADDRESSING THE THREATS TO--------------- HUMAN SECURITY POSED BY SMALL ARMS, BUT, IN PRACTICE, POLITICAL--------------- DECLARATIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
