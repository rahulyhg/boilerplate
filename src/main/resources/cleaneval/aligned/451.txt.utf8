IT WAS THE EXASPERATION.--IT IS NOT EAS Y TO EAT WITH TWO PATHETIC, UNBLINKING EYES FOCUSED ON YOUR EVERY MOVE.- IT ISN'T EASY DOING ANYTHING IN THAT-SITUATION.-- I HAVE HAD DOGS GROAK ME WHILE I WAS READING.- AND IT WASN'T THE BOOK- THEY WANTED.- DOGS CAN'T READ.- AND THEY CAN'T LEARN TO READ THOUGH I--HAVE HEARD OTHERWISE-SENSIBLE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW SMART DOGS ARE- WITHOUT REFLECTING ON THE UNASSAILABLE FACT A DOG CAN'T READ.-- A DOG GROAKS YOU WHILE YOU ARE READING, NOT BECAUSE IT WANTS THE WORDS- YOU- ARE CONSUMING, BUT BECAUSE IT WANTS THE ATTENTION YOU-ARE WASTING- ON A BOOK.-- AND IT SUCCEEDS.- HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO READ WITH TWO HOT EYES A FEW- INCHES FROM YOUR FACE AND A RIPE BREATH IN YOUR FACE?-- BUT THE WORST IS FOOD.- A CHAMPION GROAKER WILL NOT ONLY SIT AIMED- STRAIGHT AT YOU IN RAPT ATTENTION AS YOU EAT, BUT IT WILL FOLLOW THE- FOOD WITH ITS EYES AND THE TILT OF ITS HEAD.---AS YOU PREPARE TO LIFT THE FOOD FROM THE PLATE, THE DOG STARES AT THE- FOOD ON THE PLATE.-- AS YOU LIFT A MORSEL TOWARD YOUR MOUTH, THE-TILT OF THE MUTT'S HEAD- FOLLOWS, ITS EYES IN UNISON WITH YOUR EVERY MOVE.---AS THE FOOD REACHES YOUR MOUTH AND YOU POP IT IN, THE DOG FOCUSES ON- YOUR CHEWING MOUTH.- AND IT ISN'T EASY EATING WITH A DOG STARING AT YOU R LIPS.- AS YOU SWALLOW, THE DOG'S GAZE MEETS YOUR OWN WITH A- HOW-COULD-YOU LOOK, THE DOG'S EYES WATER, THE DOG'S MOUTH SLOBBERS AND- THE DOG SOFTLY WHINES.- AND OF COURSE, ANY DECENT PERSON WILL DO- SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.- YOU MUST TAKE THE DOG BY THE COLLAR AND WALK IT- TO THE CLOSET, LOCKING IT IN THERE UNTIL DINNER IS OVER SO THE POOR- THING WON'T SUFFER SO MUCH.-- THE ONLY OTHER CHOICE IS TO GET UP, GIVE THE-DOG YOUR PLACE AT THE TABL E AND GO WHINE IN THE CLOSET YOURSELF.-- AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL DO THAT IF YOU DON'T REMOVE THE DOG FROM THE ROOM- BECAUSE NOBODY CAN ENJOY HIS DINNER WITH DOG EYES FOLLOWING HIS EVERY--MOVE.- THE BEST SAUCE IS HUNGER.- THE WORST SAUCE IS GROAKING.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
