------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GROWING CHRISTMAS TREES IN-NORTH CAROLINA-------------- CHRISTMAS TREE FERTILITY--------- OPTIMUM FERTILIZATION PROMOTES QUALITY GROWTH AND- GIVES TREES LUXURIANT FOLIAGE WITH A DEEP, RICH COLOR. TREES- WITH BALANCED NUTRIENTS ARE-MORE RESISTANT TO PEST-PROBLEMS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES. THE AMOUNT OF FERTILIZER OR- LIME NEEDED TO ACHIEVE OPTIMUM NUTRIENT LEVELS IN THE TREE- WILL VARY WITH DIFFERENT SOILS AND SITES OR EVEN DIFFERENT- LAND USE HISTORY. TOO MUCH OF A NUTRIENT IS OFTEN AS HARMFUL- TO CHRISTMAS TREES AS TOO LITTLE. THE ONLY WAY TO- OPTIMIZE TREE GROWTH IS TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH SITE-SPECIFIC- FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS BASED ON THE RESULTS OF TIMELY SOIL AND- TISSUE ANALYSIS. EFFECTIVE FERTILIZER MANAGEMENT IS AN- ONGOING PROCESS THAT SUCCEEDS BEST WHEN CAREFULLY PLANNED- AND MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE CROP ROTATION.-------- SOIL SAMPLES SHOULD BE TAKEN REGULARLY THROUGHOUT- THE COURSE OF GROWING CHRISTMAS TREES. THE FIRST SOIL- SAMPLES SHOULD BE TAKEN DURING INITIAL SITE EVALUATION. IF THE PH- OR NUTRIENTS SUCH AS PHOSPHORUS OR CALCIUM ARE LOW-, MATERIALS CAN BE TILLED INTO THE SOIL BEFORE TREE PLANTING- WITH GREATER SUCCESS THAN LATER TOP DRESSING OF FERTILIZERS- OR LIME. SUBSEQUENT SOIL SAMPLES SHOULD BE COLLECTED AT- LEAST EVERY OTHER YEAR, AND MANY GROWERS CHOOSE TO TAKE- ANNUAL SAMPLES. TIME INVESTED IN CAREFUL COLLECTION OF- SOIL SAMPLES WILL INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY- FOLLOWING FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS. IN NORTH CAROLINA, SOIL- SAMPLE BOXES CAN BE OBTAINED AND SAMPLES SENT FROM ANY- NORTH CAROLINA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE COUNTY- CENTER. THE NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE- PROVIDES SOIL AND PLANT TISSUE ANALYSIS AS WELL AS OTHER- DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES TO IN-STATE RESIDENTS.-------- ONCE THE TREES IN A FIELD ARE WELL ESTABLISHED-, PLANT TISSUE SAMPLES SHOULD PERIODICALLY BE COLLECTED ALONG- WITH REGULAR SOIL SAMPLES. TISSUE ANALYSIS PROVIDES THE STATUS- OF 11 NUTRIENTS INSIDE THE PLANT (FOUR MORE THAN REPORTED- IN SOIL ANALYSIS). TISSUE SAMPLING ALSO REFLECTS WHAT A PLANT- IS ACTUALLY ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THE SOIL, NOT JUST WHAT- IS AVAILABLE. UNDER NORMAL GROWING CONDITIONS-, TISSUE SAMPLES SHOULD ACCOMPANY THE SOIL SAMPLES AT ABOUT- THE MIDDLE OF THE ROTATION AND THEN AGAIN THE YEAR- BEFORE HARVEST. USUALLY-ABOUT TWO SHOOTS ARE-COLLECTED FROM- THE SAME FIVE TO 10 TREES FROM WHICH SOIL IS SAMPLED.- TISSUE SAMPLING IS A NECESSARY TOOL FOR EVALUATING AND- FINE-TUNING FERTILITY MANAGEMENT.-------- WHEN FERTILITY PROBLEMS OCCUR IN A FIELD-, ADDITIONAL SAMPLING CAN BE USEFUL. PROBLEM AREAS SHOULD BE- SAMPLED (AND MANAGED) SEPARATELY FROM NORMAL AREAS OF A- FIELD. THE CONTRAST BETWEEN NORMAL AND PROBLEM SAMPLES- CAN OFTEN PINPOINT-THE CAUSE OF A FERTILITY PROBLEM.- OFTEN MULTIPLE-DEPTH SOIL SAMPLING CAN PROVIDE GREATER- INSIGHT THAN A SINGLE TOPSOIL SAMPLE. WHEN NUTRITIONAL- PROBLEMS OCCUR, MATCHING TISSUE SAMPLES SHOULD ACCOMPANY- ANY SPECIAL SOIL SAMPLING. IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL SEASONS- TO CORRECT A FERTILITY PROBLEM.-------- FERTILIZER MATERIALS SHOULD BE TARGETED TO THE- RECOMMENDATIONS AND DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED BY SOIL AND- TISSUE ANALYSIS FOR EACH FIELD, WITHOUT APPLYING A SINGLE- BLENDED MATERIAL ACROSS THE BOARD. ANNUAL APPLICATIONS OF- NITROGEN PER ACRE ARE RECOMMENDED BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS- OF THE CROP AND THE AGE AND SIZE OF THE TREES.- DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF A NITROGEN FERTILIZER WILL BE NEEDED- DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF ACTUAL NITROGEN CONTAINED IN- IT. DIFFERENT NITROGEN SOURCES HAVE VARYING EFFECT ON- PH, SOLUBLE SALT INDEX, AND LEACHING AND SHOULD BE- SELECTED ACCORDINGLY. DIFFERENT BLENDS CAN ALSO SATISFY THE NEED- FOR CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF PHOSPHOROUS, POTASSIUM, OR- OTHER NUTRIENTS AND SHOULD BE SELECTED TO FULFILL THE RATIO- OF REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH NUTRIENT. SEE TABLE 4 FOR A LIST- OF COMMONLY USED FERTILIZERS AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ BOTH-------------------------------------------THE TIMING AND METHOD OF FERTILIZER- APPLICATION ARE CRITICAL TO SUCCESSFUL NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT.- DIFFERENT NUTRIENTS HAVE THEIR OWN REQUIREMENTS FOR TIMING.- MATERIALS WITH A HIGH SOLUBLE SALT CONTENT CONTAINING NITROGEN- OR POTASSIUM SHOULD-NOT BE APPLIED DURING THE HEAT- OF SUMMER OR DURING A DROUGHT. LARGE APPLICATIONS SHOULD- BE SPLIT BETWEEN TWO TIMINGS. PHOSPHORUS SHOULD BE BUILT- UP EARLY IN A CROP ROTATION RATHER THAN ADDING AN- INCREMENTAL AMOUNT EACH SEASON. EARLY IN A ROTATION, MANY- GROWERS BAND FERTILIZER OUTSIDE THE DRIPLINE OF SMALL TREES- TO MAXIMIZE AVAILABILITY, BUT AFTER TREES ARE ABOUT 2 YEARS- OLD, BROADCAST APPLICATIONS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE. WHERE- GROWERS MECHANIZE THEIR FERTILIZATION, THEY ARE OFTEN ABLE- TO ACHIEVE A MORE UNIFORM BROADCAST APPLICATION.- WHILE GROUND-APPLIED FERTILIZATION IS THE PRIMARY METHOD- OF NUTRIENT DELIVERY, IT OCCASIONALLY MUST BE- SUPPLEMENTED WITH FOLIAR-APPLIED LIQUID SPRAYS PARTICULARLY- WHERE MICRONUTRIENTS ARE DEFICIENT OR TIED UP IN THE SOIL.-------- FOR A FERTILITY PROGRAM TO SUCCEED, A VARIETY OF- TOOLS AND METHODS MUST BE USED, USUALLY IN DIFFERENT- COMBINATIONS FROM SEASON TO SEASON.--------------------- BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO PROTECT WATER QUALITY AND- THE ENVIRONMENT--------- ALTHOUGH OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE, TREE QUALITY AND- NET FARM PROFIT ARE NOT THE ONLY OBJECTIVES THAT A- CHRISTMAS TREE GROWER SHOULD PURSUE. A FARMER SHOULD MANAGE- THE CROP IN SUCH A WAY THAT PRODUCTION CAN BE SUSTAINED- WELL INTO THE FUTURE.-TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE-QUALITY OF LIFE MUST- BE PROTECTED ON ALL LEVELS. SOIL MUST BE PROTECTED- FROM EROSION. SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER MUST BE PROTECTED- FROM SEDIMENTATION AND CONTAMINATION BY FERTILIZERS- OR PESTICIDES. WILDLIFE SHOULD NOT BE HARMED BY ANY- FARMING PRACTICES. THE HEALTH OF FARM WORKERS SHOULD NOT -BE ENDANGERED BY IMPROPER HANDLING, STORAGE, OR USE- OF PESTICIDES.--------- CHRISTMAS TREE FARMERS WHO INVEST IN PRACTICES- AND INPUTS THAT ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS USUALLY SHOW A- GREATER LONG-TERM PROFIT BECAUSE THE LAND IS MAINTAINED AT--HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE LEVELS. COLLECTIVELY, THE ADDED OR--ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTION PRACTICES THAT PROTECT THE QUALITY OF LIFE- ARE CALLED--- BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES----. FOR PRODUCTION TO- BE SUSTAINED, A COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING BEST- MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SHOULD BE IN PLACE ON EVERY CHRISTMAS-- TREE FARM.-------- FARM ROAD CONSTRUCTION------------- THE ROADS ON MANY FARMS ARE TOO STEEP, ARE CONSTRUCTED- OF EASILY ERODIBLE MATERIAL, AND/OR ARE POORLY DESIGNED- TO MANAGE FLOOD WATER. ROADS-CONSTRUCTED AT NO MORE THAN- A-9 PERCENT GRADE WILL-NOT-GENERALLY WASH OUT. -ADEQUATE DRAINAGE DITCHES WITH LARGE GRAVEL OR RIPRAP WILL- ELIMINATE EROSION OF THE ROADBED AND WATER DRAINAGE PROBLEMS- IN FIELDS BELOW THE ROAD. INSTALLING AN ADEQUATE SURFACE- TO HANDLE TRAFFIC IS ALSO CRITICAL. WITH INCREASING GRADE-, SLOPE LENGTH, AND TRAFFIC, FESCUE GRASS WILL FAIL BEFORE A- GRAVEL SURFACE WILL. PROFESSIONAL ADVICE FROM SOIL- CONSERVATIONISTS SHOULD BE UTILIZED TO DEVELOP PLANS FOR LONG-LASTING- ROADS (AND FIELDS) OR TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING ROADS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FIELD BORDERS AND STREAM BUFFERS------------- FIELD BORDERS AND STREAM BUFFERS ARE PERHAPS THE--CHEAPEST WAY TO CONTAIN SEDIMENTS AND ANY NUTRIENTS OR- PESTICIDES THAT-ARE PRESENT IN THE SEDIMENTS. A 10- TO- 25-FOOT-WIDE GRASSY STRIP WILL TRAP SEDIMENTATION-FROM ALL BUT THE- MOST SEVERE RAIN STORMS. THESE STRIPS CAN USUALLY DOUBLE- AS FIELD ROADS.-------- LOW-IMPACT SITE PREPARATION------------- SOME LAND CURRENTLY IN CHRISTMAS TREE PRODUCTION IS- TOO STEEP AND ERODIBLE TO BEAR EXTENSIVE MECHANICAL- SITE PREPARATION. SOILS ALSO MAY BE TOO SHALLOW OR- EASILY COMPACTED TO WITHSTAND THE HEAVY TRAFFIC. LESS- DISRUPTIVE SITE PREPARATION PRACTICES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR- THESE SITUATIONS. ANY TIMBER AND BRUSH IS CUT CLOSE TO THE- GROUND WITHOUT DISTURBING THE MAT OF-ROOTS THAT HOLD THE SOIL- IN PLACE. ALL OR A MAJORITY OF STUMPS ARE LEFT UNDISTURBED.- NO TILLAGE IS ATTEMPTED. IF SEEDLINGS ARE PLANTED- MECHANICALLY, ANY AREAS NEAR STUMPS ARE PLANTED BY HAND OR LEFT- EMPTY. HARDWOOD SPROUTS FROM STUMPS ARE A GREATER -PROBLEM WITH THIS-APPROACH, BUT LABELED HERBICIDES CAN- CONTROL THEM. ACHIEVING OPTIMUM FERTILITY MAY ALSO BE- MORE DIFFICULT WITHOUT TILLAGE, BUT BY PRESERVING THE- TOPSOIL, CHRISTMAS TREE PRODUCTION CAN BE SUSTAINED ON- THESE DIFFICULT SITES.-------- PEST SCOUTING-------------- BY SCOUTING FOR PESTS, GROWERS CAN REDUCE THE FREQUENCY- OF PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS AND THE COST OF PEST- MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WHILE INCREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR- EFFORTS. PEST THRESHOLDS AND SCOUTING METHODS HAVE BEEN--DEVELOPED FOR MOST OF THE MAJOR CHRISTMAS TREE PESTS.- INFORMATION GENERATED BY SCOUTING INDICATES THE NEED FOR- PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS AND ASSURES THAT SUCH APPLICATIONS- ARE TARGETED TO POTENTIALLY DAMAGING PEST POPULATIONS.--------- PESTICIDE ALTERNATIVES-------------- WHERE SEVERAL PESTICIDES ARE LABELED FOR A SPECIFIC- CHRISTMAS TREE PEST, GROWERS HAVE THE CHOICE OF SELECTING- THE MATERIAL THAT IS LEAST TOXIC TO BENEFICIAL INSECTS-, THE ENVIRONMENT, AND WILDLIFE. TOXICITY OF CERTAIN- PESTICIDES TO SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ANIMALS, SUCH AS FISH OR- AQUATIC INSECTS, CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. SAFE PESTICIDE CHOICES- WILL CHANGE DEPENDING ON PROXIMITY TO CRITICAL HABITATS OR- EVEN THE SEASON AND LIFE CYCLE OF VULNERABLE WILDLIFE- SPECIES. SOME LESS-TOXIC MATERIALS MAY REQUIRE DIFFERENT- EQUIPMENT, HANDLING, OR TIMING FROM TRADITIONAL- PESTICIDE CHOICES. BE SURE TO EVALUATE ALL FACTORS WHEN- CONSIDERING PESTICIDE SELECTION. FOR SOME PESTS, GROWERS CAN- APPLY PESTICIDES AT ALTERNATIVE TIMES, SUCH AS FALL OR WINTER-, WHEN BENEFICIAL INSECTS OR AT-RISK WILDLIFE ARE NOT PRESENT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GROUNDCOVER MANAGEMENT-------------- PRODUCTION OF QUALITY CHRISTMAS TREES DEPENDS LARGELY- ON THE BALANCED MANAGEMENT OF WEED COMPETITION. UNCHECKED WEED COMPETITION HURTS TREE GROWTH, BUT- REPEATED EXPOSURE OF THE SOIL SURFACE WITH RESULTING- EROSION WILL SHORTEN THE PRODUCTIVE LIFE OF A FIELD. OUT OF- NECESSITY, GROWERS HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM PREDOMINANT USE- OF LONG-LASTING PRE-EMERGENT HERBICIDES AND- BARE-GROUND WEED CONTROL. GROUNDCOVERS ARE THE PRIMARY TOOL- FOR STABILIZING THE SOIL WITHIN A FIELD OF TREES. BEST- MANAGEMENT PRACTICES INVOLVE SUPPRESSION OF NATIVE- VEGETATION AND-OR ESTABLISHMENT OF COVER CROPS. THIS- REDUCES COMPETITION FOR NUTRIENTS- WATER, AND SPACE WHILE- MAINTAINING ALMOST TOTAL-COVERAGE OF THE SOIL. AN- ALTERNATIVE PRACTICE IS TO SOW COVER CROPS--SUCH AS CLOVER OR RYE-, THAT REDUCE GERMINATION OF NATIVE WEED SEEDS AND THAT CAN- BE MANAGED MORE UNIFORMLY. REGARDLESS OF THE- APPROACH, GROUNDCOVERS ARE A SECOND CROP THAT MUST BE- CONSCIOUSLY MANAGED IN ANY CHRISTMAS TREE FIELD.-------- NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT------------- IN NORTH CAROLINA REGIONS HAVING SANDY SOILS AND- SHALLOW WATER TABLES, NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT IS A CRITICAL FACTOR- IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CLEAN AND HEALTHY DRINKING WATER.- LARGE APPLICATIONS OF FERTILIZER CAN POSSIBLY LEACH INTO- THE GROUNDWATER. SMALLER APPLICATIONS SPREAD OUT OVER- A SEASON CAN INCREASE UPTAKE BY THE CROP AND REDUCE- THE PROBABILITY OF LEACHING. LEACHING OF FERTILIZER INTO- THE GROUNDWATER IS NOT GENERALLY A MAJOR PROBLEM, BUT- SOME PRECAUTIONS ARE STILL NECESSARY. BEST MANAGEMENT- PRACTICES DEPEND ON REGULAR USE OF SOIL AND TISSUE ANALYSIS AS- THE BASIS FOR ALL FERTILIZER AND LIME APPLICATIONS.- APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE SPECIFIC TO THE NEEDS OF EACH FIELD.- WHERE PRACTICAL, ANNUAL NITROGEN REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE- SPLIT INTO TWO APPLICATIONS TO REDUCE LEACHING POTENTIAL AND- RISK OF SALT INJURY TO TREE ROOTS.-------- PESTICIDE HANDLING, STORAGE, AND DISPOSAL-------------- PESTICIDES ARE MOST HAZARDOUS WHEN THEY ARE IN- CONCENTRATED FORM DURING MIXING, STORAGE, AND DISPOSAL.- PESTICIDES SHOULD ALWAYS BE MIXED AND LOADED FAR AWAY- FROM WELLS, SPRINGS, OR STREAMS. PROGRESSIVE FARMERS ARE- INSTALLING COVERED AND CONTAINED CONCRETE MIXING PADS-, WHICH CAPTURE ANY SPILLS OR RINSE WATER. SECURE PESTICIDE- STORAGE AREAS ARE BUILT ON THE SAME PADS. PVC FIELD MIXING- PADS ELIMINATE RISKY POURING FROM PESTICIDE CONTAINERS AND- COST LESS THAN PERMANENT FACILITIES. WHEN EMPTY, ALL- LIQUID PESTICIDE CONTAINERS SHOULD BE TRIPLE-RINSED AND- PUNCTURED BEFORE DISPOSAL IN LANDFILLS. OTHER METHODS OF DISPOSING- OF CONTAINERS ARE ILLEGAL AND RISK GROUNDWATER- CONTAMINATION. FOR LIABILITY AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS, FARM MANAGERS- AND FOREMEN SHOULD ALL BE-KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE- HANDLING, STORAGE, AND LEGAL DISPOSAL OF PESTICIDES AND THEIR- CONTAINERS. PESTICIDE HANDLERS MUST COMPLETE THE- APPROPRIATE LICENSING AND PESTICIDE TRAINING.-------- WELLHEAD PROTECTION-------------- POORLY-CONSTRUCTED WELLHEADS ARE A MAJOR SOURCE- OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION FROM FERTILIZERS OR- PESTICIDES. GOOD WELLS ARE GROUTED AND SEALED WITH CONCRETE- AND, IDEALLY, ENCLOSED IN A CONCRETE COVER WITH A CONCRETE- FLOOR. SEVERAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES CAN REDUCE THE RISK- OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION REGARDLESS OF WELL- CONSTRUCTION. NO AGRICULTURAL MATERIALS SHOULD BE MIXED AT- THE WELLHEAD. HOSES OR FAUCETS SHOULD PROVIDE WATER AT- A MIXING AREA AWAY FROM AND PREFERABLY DOWNHILL FROM- THE WELLHEAD. A GRASSY BUFFER AT LEAST 10 FEET WIDE- SHOULD PROTECT THE WELL FROM HIGH TRAFFIC AREAS OR ANY- PESTICIDE APPLICATION AREAS. THE WELL COVER SHOULD BE ABOVE- THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE AND THE IMMEDIATE LAND- SHOULD SLOPE AWAY FROM THE WELL. IF PRODUCTION AREAS ARE ABOVE- A WELL, CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE LEACHABILITY- OF FERTILIZERS OR PESTICIDES USED.-------- SUMMARY-------------- CHRISTMAS TREES ARE A RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE- AGRICULTURAL CROP. WITH APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATION OF- WATER QUALITY, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS, AND WORKER- SAFETY, PROBLEMS NEED NOT OCCUR.----------------------- SHAPING OF CHRISTMAS TREES--------- SHAPING IS NECESSARY FOR HIGH-QUALITY CHRISTMAS TREES.- THE TERM----- "SHAPING-----" IS APPLIED TO ANY CUTTING DONE TO SHAPE- THE PLANT TO ITS DESIRED APPEARANCE. THIS MAY DONE BY- EITHER SHEARING OR PRUNING.-------- THE TERM----- "SHEARING-----" REFERS TO CUTTING BACK THE- CURRENT YEAR'S GROWTH OF THE LEADER AND LATERAL LIMBS.- SHEARING REDUCES DEFORMITIES AND IMPROVES THE SHAPE OF THE- TREE. PRUNING IS THE REMOVAL OF INJURED, DEAD, OR DISEASED- PARTS OR WOOD OLDER THAN THE CURRENT GROWTH.-------- SINCE ANY ONE SET OF GUIDELINES IS NOT SUITABLE FOR- ALL TREES, SEVERAL SPECIES WILL BE CONSIDERED SEPARATELY.- IDEALLY A TREE SHOULD RESEMBLE A CONE, WIDE AT THE BASE- AND TAPERING UNIFORMLY TO THE TIP. THE BASE SHOULD BE- ABOUT TWO-THIRDS AS WIDE AS THE TREE IS TALL. TAPER IS DEFINED AS- THE TREE WIDTH AT THE BASE DIVIDED BY THE TREE HEIGHT.- ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS FOR A TAPER WILL RANGE FROM A MINIMUM- WIDTH OF 40 PERCENT OF THE HEIGHT TO A MAXIMUM OF- 90 PERCENT.--------- SOME GROWERS PREFER TO SHEAR USING KNIVES WITH A- 14-INCH BLADE, ALTHOUGH STRONG HEDGE SHEARS AND- SPECIALLY-DESIGNED MACHINES CAN BE USED WITH SUCCESS. IF KNIVES- ARE USED, THEY SHOULD HAVE HIGH-QUALITY BLADES THAT RETAIN- A VERY SHARP EDGE WITH MINIMUM SHARPENING. REGARDLESS- OF THE TYPE OF TOOL USED, PERSONAL SAFETY IS A PRIMARY CONCERN.--------- FIRS AND SPRUCES-------------- FIRS AND SPRUCES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT- TREATMENTS THAN PINES. IN THESE SPECIES, LATERAL BUDS DEVELOP ALONG- THE CURRENT LEADER AND BRANCH GROWTH AND ARE NOT- INITIATED FROM FASCICLES (BUNDLES OF NEEDLES FOUND ON PINES).- NEW GROWTH MAY BE CUT-ANY TIME AFTER BRANCH ELONGATION IS- 80 PERCENT COMPLETE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING SPRING BEFORE- NEW GROWTH STARTS.--------- IT IS BEST TO USE A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF SHEARING- AND PRUNING SO THAT THE TREES WILL HAVE A NATURAL- APPEARANCE. THE MAIN THING TO STRIVE FOR IS COMPACTNESS BY- CONTROLLING HEIGHT AND LATERAL GROWTH. MOST GROWERS CUT THE LEADERS-- IN SUMMER, ALTHOUGH THE SAME PROCESS-MAY BE USED---- UNTIL LATE SPRING JUST BEFORE DORMANCY IS BROKEN.- TO MAINTAIN THE-DESIRED CONE SHAPE, THE TERMINAL PORTION- OF LATERAL BRANCHES-ARE ALSO REMOVED. CORRECT- SUMMER SHEARING ALLOWS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A DENSER-, HIGHER-QUALITY TREE, THROUGH GROWTH OF VEGETATIVE BUDS ON- THE STEM AND BRANCHES.-------- WHEN THE TREES REACH 3 TO 4 FEET IN HEIGHT-, BOTTOM BRANCHES MAY BE CUT TO PROVIDE A----- "HANDLE,-----" DEPENDING- ON WHAT BUYERS EXPECT.-------- WHITE PINE------------- IT IS IMPORTANT TO START SHEARING WHITE PINE AT THE- PROPER YEAR AND SEASON. WHEN THE TREE IS ABOUT 12 TO 24 INCHES- IN HEIGHT, THE TERMINAL BUD SHOULD BE REMOVED TO- PROVIDE MORE LIMBS FOR WHAT WILL BE THE BASE OF THE TREE. THIS- HEIGHT SHOULD BE ADJUSTED UPWARD FOR A TREE GROWING ON A- STEEP SLOPE. SHEARING WILL STIMULATE PRODUCTION OF BUDS- AND MAKE THE TREE MORE DENSE AND COMPACT. THE SEASON- TO SHEAR WHITE PINE IS BETWEEN THE TIME THE NEW- LEADER COMPLETES ITS GROWTH AND BEFORE IT----- "HARDENS.-----" THESE- DATES VARY WITH THE GROWING CONDITIONS, THE ELEVATION, AND- THE SEASON, BUT IS GENERALLY DURING THE PERIOD OF JUNE TO- EARLY-JULY.-------- START SHEARING BY CUTTING THE LEADER TO DESIRED- LENGTH (10 TO 14 INCHES IS USUALLY BEST) AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE-, WITH THE FACE OF THE CUT IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION TO- REDUCE DRYING. THE SIDE BRANCHES OF THE TOP WHORL SHOULD BE- CUT SO THAT THEY ARE 3 TO 5 INCHES SHORTER THAN THE TERMINAL.- THE SIDE BRANCHES ARE THEN CLIPPED TO SHAPE THE TREE INTO- A CONE. OVERSHEARING SHOULD BE AVOIDED, AS CLOSE-- SHAVED TREES ARE NOT THE MOST DESIRABLE.-------- SHEARING SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO THE CURRENT- YEAR'S GROWTH BECAUSE OLDER GROWTH DOES NOT USUALLY SET- BUDS. WHEN THE TREE IS ABOUT 3 FEET TO 4 FEET HIGH-, BOTTOM BRANCHES SHOULD BE CUT OFF SO THAT A HANDLE WILL- BE AVAILABLE WHEN THE TREE IS HARVESTED.-------- VIRGINIA PINE------------- GUIDELINES FOR SHAPING VIRGINIA PINE ARE GENERALLY- SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR WHITE PINE. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF ITS- GROWTH HABIT, VIRGINIA PINE NEEDS TO BE SHEARED AT LEAST TWICE- AND SOMETIMES MORE FREQUENTLY EACH YEAR. --------TIME OF SHEARING CAN BE BETTER JUDGED FROM- NEEDLE GROWTH THAN THE CALENDAR. A GOOD RULE IS TO BEGIN- SHEARING WHEN NEW NEEDLES ARE ONE-HALF AS LONG AS NEEDLES FROM- THE PREVIOUS FLUSH.-------- CORRECTIVE SHAPING CAN USUALLY BE DONE AT ANY TIME- OF THE YEAR. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT MULTIPLE- LEADERS BE REMOVED EARLY IN THE LIFE OF THE TREE.- ADDITIONALLY----- "HANDLES-----" SHOULD BE PRUNED AT LEAST 2 YEARS BEFORE HARVEST.-------- REDCEDAR AND LEYLAND CYPRESS------------- REDCEDAR CAN BE SHEARED LIGHTLY AT ANY TIME DURING- THE GROWING SEASON WITH HEDGE CLIPPERS OR KNIVES.- LEYLAND CYPRESS SHOULD ALSO BE SHEARED LIGHTLY, WITH THE BEST- TIME LATE IN THE GROWING SEASON.--------------------------- GROUNDCOVER MANAGEMENT--------- GROUNDCOVER OR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL- IN PRODUCING HIGH-QUALITY CHRISTMAS TREES. MANY- GROWERS HAVE PRODUCED CHRISTMAS TREES WITH BARE GROUND- BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT GROUNDCOVER COMPETITION- FOR WATER, NUTRIENTS, AND LIGHT. HOWEVER, MAINTAINING- BARE SOIL CAN LEAD TO SOIL DETERIORATION RESULTING IN- INCREASED SOIL EROSION, POOR ROOT GROWTH, AND POOR TREE- QUALITY. THERE ARE MANY GROUNDCOVERS RANGING FROM NATIVE- PLANTS TO INTRODUCED PLANT SPECIES WHICH, IF MANAGED- PROPERLY, CAN BE USED AS A GROUNDCOVER WITHOUT IMPACTING- TREE GROWTH AND QUALITY.-------- SCOUTING WEED SPECIES IN THE PLANTATION IS THE FIRST- STEP IN A GROUNDCOVER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. INFORMATION- ON WEED IDENTIFICATION CAN BE OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS- AGENCIES, AND THERE ARE MANY GOOD WEED IDENTIFICATION- REFERENCES (SEE---------------------------- APPENDIX----).- IDENTIFYING THE TYPE, DENSITY, AND- LOCATION OF THE VEGETATION IN THE PLANTATION-IS AN IMPORTANT PART- OF THE MANAGEMENT PROCESS.-------- VEGETATION MAY BE GROUPED INTO FIVE MAJOR- CATEGORIES: PERENNIAL-GRASSES, PERENNIAL BROADLEAFS, ANNUAL- GRASSES, ANNUAL BROADLEAFS, AND WOODY PERENNIAL VEGETATION- (TREES, SHRUBS, AND VINES).-------- WHETHER THE VEGETATION OCCURS BETWEEN THE ROWS- OR WITHIN ROWS IS ALSO IMPORTANT. COMPETITION IS- GREATEST FROM VEGETATION IN THE AREA IMMEDIATELY AROUND THE TREE- OR WITHIN A ROW. VEGETATION GROWING BETWEEN THE ROWS IS- LESS OF A COMPETITIVE THREAT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS FURTHER- FROM THE TREE.-------- SINCE PERENNIAL GRASSES ARE VERY COMPETITIVE-, GROWERS SHOULD MINIMIZE THEM WITHIN ROWS. IN ADDITION-, PERENNIAL GRASSES FOUND BETWEEN ROWS SHOULD BE MECHANICALLY- OR CHEMICALLY MOWED (SUPPRESSED VIA LOW RATES OF- POST-EMERGENCE HERBICIDES) TO CONTROL COMPETITION.--------- WHILE WOODY VEGETATION IS NOT PARTICULARLY- COMPETITIVE, IT DOES INTERFERE WITH TREE WORK, AND IS EASIEST- TO CONTROL PRIOR TO PLANTING. SINCE MOST WOODY VEGETATION- IS PERENNIAL WITH WELL ESTABLISHED DEEP ROOT SYSTEMS, IT- CAN BE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. CHOICE OF- CONTROL MEASURES AND TIMING IS CRITICAL.-------- VEGETATION DESIRABLE FOR USE AS GROUNDCOVER- GENERALLY EXHIBITS ONE OF TWO USEFUL CHARACTERISTICS: IT IS- NATURALLY LESS COMPETITIVE, OR IT IS RELIABLY CONTROLLED EITHER- THROUGH MECHANICAL OR CHEMICAL MOWING. LESS- COMPETITIVE GROUNDCOVERS INCLUDE BROADLEAF ANNUALS OR PERENNIALS- THAT SELDOM GROW TALL ENOUGH TO INTERFERE WITH TREE- GROWTH. SUCH SPECIES INCLUDE STRAWBERRIES, VIOLETS-, DANDELIONS, PLANTAINS, GROUNDSELS, AND COMMON TRAILING- CINQUEFOIL. GROUNDCOVERS THAT CAN AND MUST BE SUPPRESSED- BECAUSE THEY ARE OTHERWISE TOO COMPETITIVE OR INTERFERE- WITH SHEARING OR HARVEST INCLUDE CLOVER, SMARTWEED, WILD- CARROT, YARROW, RED SORREL, NIMBLEWILL GRASS, CHICKWEED-, ANNUAL GRASSES, AND SOME PERENNIAL GRASSES.-------- THE TWO PRINCIPAL METHODS FOR MAINTAINING GROUNDCOVER AT AN ACCEPTABLE HEIGHT BETWEEN THE ROWS- ARE MECHANICAL MOWING AND CHEMICAL APPLICATION-, EITHER SEPARATELY OR IN COMBINATION.-------- MECHANICAL MOWING------------- MOWING IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO KEEP COMPETING- PLANTS UNDER CONTROL BETWEEN ROWS. PROPERLY TIMED- MOWING REDUCES COMPETITION, RODENT DAMAGE, AND FIRE- HAZARD. ROTARY-TYPE MOWERS ARE USUALLY PREFERRED FOR- GRASS CONTROL, AS SICKLE BARS ARE PARTICULARLY APT TO DAMAGE OR- CUT TREES. HOWEVER, MECHANICAL MOWING WILL FAVOR- GRASS SPECIES THAT ARE MOST COMPETITIVE TO TREES.-------- MOWING ALONE MUST BE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES- DURING THE GROWING SEASON. IT SHOULD BE DONE OFTEN ENOUGH- TO PREVENT THE GRASSES FROM FORMING SEEDS THAT COULD- GERMINATE WITHIN THE ROW. WEATHER GREATLY DETERMINES TIMING- OF THE FIRST AND SUBSEQUENT MOWING OPERATIONS. A COOL-, DRY SPRING CAN DELAY THE FIRST MOWING. SUBSEQUENT -MOWING DURING THE GROWING SEASON DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE- FREQUENCY AND AMOUNT OF RAINFALL AND FERTILITY OF THE SITE.-------- CHEMICAL APPLICATION------------- HERBICIDES ARE AN EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE TO- MECHANICAL MOWING FOR CONTROLLING COMPETITION BY WEEDS AND- GRASSES. HERBICIDES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS EITHER- PRE-EMERGENT OR POST-EMERGENT, DEPENDING ON THE STAGE OF THE WEEDS- THE HERBICIDE IS DESIGNED TO CONTROL.-------- THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A CHEMICAL CAN VARY FROM- NO RESPONSE TO A COMPLETE KILL, DEPENDING ON- APPLICATION CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURES. TO BE EFFECTIVE-, HERBICIDES SHOULD BE CAREFULLY SELECTED. SEVERAL DIFFERENT USES- OF CHEMICALS ARE IN NEW PLANTINGS IN A CLEANLY- CULTIVATED FIELD, NEW PLANTINGS IN A SOD, OR ON ESTABLISHED- PLANTATIONS. RESPONSE TO CHEMICALS WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL- FACTORS, SUCH AS SIZE, KIND AND GROWING CONDITION OF TARGET- PLANTS, TIME OF APPLICATION, SOIL COMPOSITION, RAINFALL-, TEMPERATURE, RATE OF DETERIORATION BEFORE BEING INCORPORATED- INTO THE SOIL, AND PERSISTENCE OF THE CHEMICAL. MOST- PROPERLY-FORMULATED HERBICIDES ARE SHORT-LIVED IN THE- ENVIRONMENT, BUT STILL THEY MUST BE CAREFULLY USED TO PREVENT- LONG-LASTING EFFECTS BY CHANGING THE COMPOSITION OF-THE PLANT- COMMUNITY.------------- "CHEMICAL MOWING-----" IS A TERM USED TO DESCRIBE- THE PRACTICE OF APPLYING POST-EMERGENT HERBICIDES AT LOW- RATES TO STUNT OR SUPPRESS WEEDS AND GRASSES. THIS PRACTICE- WAS DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE GROWERS WITH A COST-EFFECTIVE-, SOIL CONSERVING ALTERNATIVE TO BROADCAST APPLICATION OF- PRE-EMERGENCE HERBICIDES OR MECHANICAL MOWING.- CHEMICAL MOWING CAN BE USED AS A BROADCAST APPLICATION OR AS- A BETWEEN-ROW TREATMENT WHERE TREES WERE- PREVIOUSLY BANDED IN THE ROW WITH PRE-EMERGENCE HERBICIDES.-------- CHEMICAL MOWING IS GENERALLY MORE ECONOMICAL- THAN TRADITIONAL MECHANICAL MOWING. THE APPLICATION OF- LOW RATES OF HERBICIDES TWO OR THREE TIMES DURING THE- GROWING SEASON IS USUALLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAN MAINTAINING- MOWERS AND PAYING FOR THE LABOR TO MOW SEVERAL TIMES A- SEASON. CHEMICAL MOWING TYPICALLY PROVIDES CONTROL FOR 6 TO- 8 WEEKS, COMPARED TO 3 TO 4 WEEKS FOR MECHANICAL MOWING.-------- CHEMICAL MOWING ALSO FITS WELL WITH MANY OF- THE STRATEGIES USED IN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM).----- IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO THE MANAGEMENT OF WHITE- GRUBS. BY LEAVING A RAGGED HEIGHT OF SUPPRESSED VEGETATION-, MAY AND JUNE BEETLES (THE ADULTS OF WHITE GRUBS) ARE LESS- LIKELY TO LAY THEIR EGGS THAN THEY ARE IN MECHANICALLY- MOWED VEGETATION.----------IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE NEED FOR- PRE-EMERGENCE HERBICIDE APPLICATIONS CANNOT BE TOTALLY ELIMINATED- BY CHEMICAL MOWING.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
