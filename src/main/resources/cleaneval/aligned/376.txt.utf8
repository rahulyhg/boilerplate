MANIFESTED?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------! WANSONG-- XINGXIU ZENJI (1166-1246CE CHINA)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- M-----------------------------------------------------------ANY-- YEARS AGO I WAS ORDAINED A ZEN MONK. ENTERING THE SMALL MONASTERY IN-RURAL JAPAN--- WHERE I STILL LIVE,-PROVIDED THE-FORM AND DIRECTION TO THE SPIRITUAL QUEST WHICH-- HAD BEEN DEVELOPING SINCE MY YOUTH. IN---86, TEN YEARS AFTER HAVING ENTERED-- THE MONASTERY, I FIRST CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE ALEXANDER TECHNIQUE AND IMMEDIATELY-- NOTICED PARALLELS BETWEEN IT AND ZEN. SINCE THEN I HAVE OFTEN REFLECTED ON THOSE-- SIMILARITIES AND IN THE CONTEXT OF SPIRITUALITY AND ALEXANDER DISCOVERIES, I-- WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A FEW OF MY OBSERVATIONS.------------------------------------------------------------------ SPIRITUALITY HAS BEEN AN-- IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN SINCE THE DAWN OF HUMAN HISTORY.-- RELIGION DID NOT ARISE SIMPLY BECAUSE PEOPLE WANTED TO APPEASE POWERFUL FORCES.-- IT HELPED THEM RELATE TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND GROUND THEMSELVES IN IT. PRIMARILY--, THOUGH, RELIGION HAS BEEN THE MEANS TO EXPLAIN THE TRAGEDY AND SUFFERING OF-- THIS BEAUTIFUL, YET TERRIFYING WORLD. THROUGH THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF-- YEARS OF HUMAN EXISTENCE, SPIRITUALITY HAS CONSTANTLY CHANGED AND ADAPTED. RELIGION-- HAS SHOWN ITSELF TO BE VERY PRAGMATIC. WHEN ONE IDEA OF GOD OR GODS CEASES TO-- WORK, IT IS DISCARDED IN FAVOUR OF ANOTHER. ALTHOUGH THE WEST IN THE TWENTIETH-- CENTURY IS OFTEN CHARACTERISED BY ITS SECULAR BELIEF IN HUMANISM, THERE IS NOW-- GROWING INTEREST IN THE NONTHEISTIC RELIGIONS OF THE EAST, PARTICULARLY BUDDHISM.-- PERHAPS THE TWO MAIN REASONS FOR THIS ARE THE TEACHING THAT EVERYTHING IS ONE-- UNITY, TOGETHER WITH THE LIVING TRADITION OF PRACTISING UNDER A TEACHER AND-- PERSONALLY EXPERIENCING THIS FOR ONESELF.------------------------------------------------------------------ IN MY OWN CASE, I WAS DRAWN-- TO ZEN BECAUSE OF A DEEP QUESTION ABOUT HOW A PERSON OUGHT TO LIVE. HOW, I WONDERED--, COULD ONE PERSON POSSIBLY BRING ABOUT ANY CHANGE IN THE IMMENSE PROBLEMS WHICH-- FACE THE WORLD: WAR, POVERTY, VARIOUS FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION, THE DESTRUCTION-- OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON. LIKE MANY WHO CAME OF AGE IN THE 1960'S, I WAS-- SEEKING AN-ALTERNATIVE TO THE MATERIALISTIC LIFESTYLE WHICH WE PERCEIVED TO-- BE THE MAIN CAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, IN THE COURSE OF SEEKING, REFLECTING--, AND ASKING WHAT COULD BE DONE TO RESOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, I REALISED THAT IN-- ORDER TO CHANGE THE WORLD I HAD TO CHANGE MYSELF. I SAW THAT THE ROOT CAUSE-- OF ALL SUFFERING IS THE GREED, ANGER, AND FOLLY ARISING FROM THE EGO-SELF. ZEN-- SEEMED THE MOST DIRECT AND DOWN-TO-EARTH PRACTICE TO ACHIEVE FREEDOM FROM AN-- EGOCENTRIC VIEWPOINT. ONCE THAT LIBERATION IS REALISED IT WOULD THEN BE POSSIBLE-- TO 'RETURN TO THE MARKETPLACE' TO AID IN IMPARTING THAT PEACE AND FREEDOM TO-- OTHERS. TO DIE-AND BE REBORN IN THIS MANNER IS CERTAINLY NO EASY TASK, AND MANY-- YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY. YET I AM STILL VERY MUCH DEDICATED-- TO THIS WAY OF LIBERATION.------------------------------------------------------------------ THE ALEXANDER WORK CAME-- INTO MY LIFE AT A TIME WHEN I WAS HAVING MUCH DIFFICULTY-WITH PAIN IN MY LOWER-- BACK. IN FACT IT SEEMED THAT IF THE CONDITION DID NOT IMPROVE I WOULD HAVE TO-- QUIT SITTING THROUGH THE LONG RETREATS OF INTENSIVE ZAZEN WHICH WE HAVE SEVERAL-- TIMES A YEAR IN THE MONASTERY WHERE I LIVE. VERY FORTUNATELY THE PERSON WHO-- WAS TO BECOME MY MAIN ALEXANDER TEACHER CAME TO LIVE WITH US AT THE MONASTERY.-- LARGELY THROUGH HER GREAT GENEROSITY, PATIENCE AND DEDICATION I WAS ABLE TO-- OVERCOME MY BACK PROBLEM. THIS IS NO SMALL FEAT AS I AM A TALL (196CM), THIN-- (70KG) MAN WITH A SCOLIOSIS OF THE SPINE, LIVING IN AN ENVIRONMENT CONSTRUCTED-- FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MUCH, MUCH SHORTER. IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE, MY HEALTH HAS-- BEEN SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THE STRAIN OF MISUSING MY BODY. NOW, THOUGH, IN LARGE-- PART THANKS TO THE ALEXANDER WORK, I AM IN GOOD HEALTH.------------------------------------------------------------------ IT WOULD BE FUN SIMPLY-- TO WRITE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES I HAVE FACED LIVING IN THE MONASTERY: SHORT HANDLES-- ON EVERYTHING FROM BROOMS TO SHOVELS, LOW SINKS, EXTREMELY LOW THRESHOLDS, LONG-- PERIODS OF SITTING AND STANDING STILL AND SO ON. HOWEVER, AS I MUST BE AS BRIEF-- AS POSSIBLE, I WILL CONFINE MYSELF TO THE TOPIC OF SPIRITUALITY--------SPECIFICALLY-- ZEN--------AND THE ALEXANDER TECHNIQUE, A SUBJECT WHICH COULD EASILY FILL A-- BOOK.------------------------------------------------------------------ THERE IS A DEEP RELIGIOUS-- ASPECT TO THE ALEXANDER WORK WHICH IS PERHAPS OFTEN OVERLOOKED, NAMELY TRUST-- OR BELIEF. ALEXANDER IS PRAISED FOR THE HIGHLY SCIENTIFIC APPROACH HE TOOK--------BOTH-- IN THE WAY HE FOUND, AND APPLIED, HIS DISCOVERY. HOWEVER, THERE IS NOT AS GREAT-- A GAP BETWEEN SCIENCE AND RELIGION AS WE TEND TO THINK.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- SCIENCE DEMANDS-- THE FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT THERE IS A RATIONAL EXPLANATION FOR EVERYTHING--, IT ALSO REQUIRES AN IMAGINATION AND COURAGE WHICH ARE NOT DISSIMILAR TO RELIGIOUS-- CREATIVITY-- ...- A TRULY CREATIVE PHILOSOPHER OR SCIENTIST, HAS LIKE THE MYSTIC-- TO CONFRONT THE DARK WORLD OF UNCREATED REALITY AND THE CLOUD OF UNKNOWING IN-- THE HOPE OF PIERCING IT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 ALBERT EINSTEIN, COMMENTING-- ON THE RELATION BETWEEN RELIGION AND SCIENCE, SAID:--------------------------------------------------------------------------- TO KNOW WHAT IS-- IMPENETRABLE TO US REALLY EXISTS, MANIFESTING ITSELF TO US AS THE HIGHEST WISDOM-- AND THE MOST RADIANT BEAUTY, WHICH OUR DULL FACULTIES CAN COMPREHEND ONLY IN-- THEIR MOST PRIMITIVE FORMS--------THIS KNOWLEDGE, THIS FEELING IS AT THE CENTRE-- OF ALL TRUE RELIGIOUSNESS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2 ALEXANDER CLEARLY DOCUMENTED-- THE CRITICAL POINT IN HIS STUDY THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO PASS FROM THE 'KNOWN-- TO THE UNKNOWN.'--------------------------------------------------------------------------- I NOW SAW THAT-- IF I WAS EVER TO SUCCEED IN MAKING THE CHANGES IN USE I DESIRED, I MUST SUBJECT-- THE PROCESSES DIRECTING MY USE TO A NEW EXPERIENCE, THAT IS OF BEING DOMINATED-- BY REASONING INSTEAD OF FEELING. THIS MEANT THAT I MUST BE PREPARED TO CARRY-- ON WITH ANY PROCEDURE I HAD REASONED OUT AS BEST FOR MY PURPOSE, EVEN THOUGH-- THAT PROCEDURE MIGHT FEEL WRONG. IN OTHER WORDS, MY TRUST IN MY REASONING PROCESS-- TO BRING ME SAFELY TO MY 'END' MUST BE A GENUINE TRUST, NOT A HALF-TRUST NEEDING-- THE ASSURANCE OF FEELING RIGHT AS WELL.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3 FROM THE POINT OF VIEW-- OF ZEN, THERE ARE TWO INTERESTING POINTS IN ALL OF THIS (I SHOULD SAY THAT WHILE-- ZEN IS A RELIGION, IT IS ALSO A RIGOROUS STUDY OF REALITY AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY--, THE SELF). FIRST OF ALL, THE IDEA THAT SCIENCE CAN RATIONALLY EXPLAIN EVERYTHING-- IS A BELIEF. IT IS A BELIEF THAT MODERN MAN HAS NEARLY SUBSTITUTED FOR THE BELIEF-- IN GOD. YET EXPLANATION, NO MATTER HOW PRECISE, CAN NEVER BE THE REALITY ITSELF.-- SAY THE WORD 'FIRE,' FOR EXAMPLE. WHY DOESN'T IT BURN YOUR MOUTH? SAY THE WORD-- 'WATER.' WHY DOESN'T IT QUENCH YOUR THIRST? IN THESE SIMPLE EXAMPLES, WE CAN-- SEE THAT DESCRIPTIONS, WHETHER THEY BE WORDS, PICTURE IMAGES OR THOUGHTS, ARE-- NOT THE THING ITSELF. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS-ONE OF THE AXIOMS, NOT ONLY OF ZEN-- BUT OF OTHER MYSTIC TRADITIONS AS WELL, THAT REALITY ITSELF IS FUNDAMENTALLY-- UNKNOWABLE. IN THIS WAY IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE REASON TO SEE THE LIMITS OF THE-- INTELLECT AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT MUST BE TRANSCENDED, BUT TO BECOME REALITY-- ITSELF REQUIRES GREAT BELIEF.-----------------------------------------------  "IF ONLY WE COULD REALISE---------------------------- THAT EVERYTHING IS ONE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!"  THE SECOND IMPORTANT POINT-- IN THIS CONNECTION IS THAT FAITH OR TRUST IMPLIES DOUBT. NO ONE BELIEVES THAT-- THE SKY IS BLUE, THAT WATER IS WET, OR THAT SALT IS SALTY. THESE TRUTHS ARE-- SELF-EVIDENT. FOR ALEXANDER THE QUESTION AT THE CENTRE OF HIS DOUBT WAS: 'WHAT-- AM I DOING TO MYSELF TO CAUSE MY DIFFICULTIES?' THIS DOUBT WAS AN ESSENTIAL-- FACTOR, IN COMBINATION WITH HIS FAITH IN REASONING, IN FOSTERING THE DETERMINATION-- NECESSARY TO FIND A RESOLUTION TO HIS PROBLEM.------------------------------------------------------------------ IN ZEN THERE IS A SIMILAR-- PROCESS. WITHOUT GENUINE BELIEF IN THE BUDDHIST TEACHING THAT ALL BEINGS ARE-- ESSENTIALLY IN A STATE OF LIBERATION AS-THEY-ARE, WE WILL ALWAYS LOOK OUTSIDE-- THE PRESENT MOMENT. IT IS PRECISELY THE DOUBT THAT WE PERSONALLY HAVE NOT REALISED-- THIS LIBERATION, TOGETHER WITH THE FAITH THAT WE ALREADY ARE LIBERATED, WHICH-- WILL MOTIVATE US TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT OUR OWN. WHAT IS AMAZING IS THAT ALEXANDER-- ACCOMPLISHED THIS WITHOUT A TEACHER, BUT THEN SO DID SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA. FOR-- THOSE OF US FOLLOWING IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS, IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH EASIER. YET-- IT IS NECESSARY THAT WE ALSO DO WHAT THEY DID. AS ALEXANDER PUT IT SO SUCCINCTLY--------IF-- YOU WILL DO WHAT I DID, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO WHAT I DO. IF WE CAN TRULY DO-- WHAT THEY DID, IT BECOMES OUR OWN, AT WHICH POINT REASON AND FAITH ARE NO LONGER-- NECESSARY. WHAT IS THE PRACTICE REQUIRED FOR MAKING THEIR REALISATIONS OUR OWN?-- THERE ARE SOME INTRIGUING PARALLELS.------------------------------------------------------------------ ZEN IS THE DIRECT REALISATION-- OF THE ONENESS OF ALL THINGS. IN A WORD, IT IS TO FORGET THE EGO-SELF WHICH-- IS THE SOURCE OF ALL SUCH DISTINCTIONS AS RIGHT AND WRONG, LIKES AND DISLIKES--, YOU AND ME, LIFE AND DEATH. THERE IS A WELL KNOWN ZEN STORY OF A MONK NAMED-- JOSHU WHO ASKED HIS MASTER, "WHAT IS THE WAY?" HE WANTED TO KNOW THE MEANS BY-- WHICH HE COULD ATTAIN TRUE PEACE AND FREEDOM. HIS MASTER SAID, "EVERYDAY MIND-- IS THE WAY." EACH ACTIVITY IN OUR LIFE, FROM MORNING TILL EVENING, IS THE WAY-- ITSELF. JOSHU WAS NOT SATISFIED THOUGH. HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN MERE INTELLECTUAL-- UNDERSTANDING. SO HE ASKED AGAIN, "WHAT SORT OF PRACTICE CAN I DO IN ORDER TO-- TRULY REALISE THAT EVERYDAY MIND IS THE WAY?" THE MASTER REPLIED, "IF YOU LOOK-- FOR IT, YOU'LL ONLY GO IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.--PRACTICE WITH THE INTENTION-- OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND 'EVERYDAY MIND' WILL ONLY SEPARATE YOU FROM IT FURTHER.-- JOSHU WAS-GETTING MORE AND MORE CONFUSED AND SOMEWHAT DESPERATELY ASKED,--BUT-- IF I DON'T DO ANYTHING, HOW CAN I EVER UNDERSTAND THE WAY?!" HIS MASTER SAID--, "THE WAY IS NEITHER KNOWING NOR NOT KNOWING. KNOWING IS DELUSION, NOT KNOWING-- IS INDIFFERENCE. WHEN YOU HAVE REACHED THE TRUE WAY BEYOND-DOUBT, YOU WILL FIND---IT AS VAST AND BOUNDLESS AS OUTER SPACE. HOW CAN IT BE TALKED ABOUT ON THE LEVEL-- OF RIGHT AND WRONG?" WITH THESE WORDS, JOSHU ATTAINED-SUDDEN REALISATION. THE-- IMPORTANT POINT OF THIS STORY IS THAT TRUE LIBERATION IS NEITHER IN INTELLECTUAL-- UNDERSTANDING NOR IN SHRUGGING IT OFF INDIFFERENTLY.------------------------------------------------------------------ HUMAN BEINGS CAN ONLY THINK-- OF THE PAST AND THE FUTURE. ONCE SOMETHING IS PERCEIVED IT IS ALREADY PAST.---FOR THIS REASON, THE-MOMENT 'NOW'-IS UNKNOWABLE. IT IS-BEYOND KNOWING AND NOT-- KNOWING. IT IS BEYOND RIGHT AND WRONG, PROFIT AND LOSS, ENLIGHTENMENT AND DELUSION--, LIFE AND DEATH. IN A WORD, IT IS THE TIMELESS, ETERNAL REALITY WHICH MYSTICS-- AND SCIENTISTS-STRUGGLE TO APPREHEND. YET SINCE IT IS UNTHINKABLE (THE UNTHINKABLE--), IT PRECEDES CONSCIOUSNESS AND SO IT IS-ALSO OF COURSE BEYOND APPREHENSION.-------------------------------------------------------------------MANY PEOPLE ASSUME THAT-- IF ALL EVIL COULD SOMEHOW BE ERADICATED ONLY GOOD WOULD REMAIN. BUT THIS IS-- IMPOSSIBLE. GOOD AND EVIL CAN ONLY EXIST IN OPPOSITION TO EACH OTHER. THIS HAS-- GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE ALEXANDER WORK. ALEXANDER CLEARLY SAW THE PROBLEM-- ARISING FROM KNOWING. "YOU CAN'T DO WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW, IF YOU KEEP DOING WHAT-- YOU DO KNOW."5 IF WE CAN SIMPLY GIVE UP THE DESIRE TO BE RIGHT, THEN, WRONG-- IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARS AND WE ARE LEFT WITH THE PRESENT MOMENT WHICH IS EMPTY-- OF EITHER ONE.------------------------------------------------------------------ NO ONE CAN THINK TWO THOUGHTS-- AT THE SAME TIME. IT SIMPLY IS NOT POSSIBLE TO THINK OF BEING RIGHT AND BEING-- WRONG AT THE SAME TIME. ONE THOUGHT MUST DISAPPEAR BEFORE ANOTHER CAN ARISE.-- THIS ONE THOUGHT IS THE UNKNOWABLE 'NOW.' BY PERCEIVING 'ME', THE EGO CONSCIOUSNESS-- DIVIDES ONE THING INTO TWO: PAST AND FUTURE, YOU AND ME, RIGHT AND WRONG. WE-- ARE CONSTANTLY CHOOSING BETWEEN WHAT WE LIKE AND WHAT WE DO NOT. YET THESE ARE-- MERELY IDEAS, THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY EXIST.------------------------------------------------------------------ 'ENDGAINING' IS THE TERM-- ALEXANDER GAVE TO THE UNCONSCIOUS TENDENCY FOR PEOPLE TO BECOME FIXATED ON THE-- RESULT OF A PROCESS, RATHER THAN PAYING-ATTENTION TO THE MEANS BY WHICH IT IS-- ATTAINED. IT WAS HIS GENIUS TO DESCRIBE HOW THE HABIT OF WANTING TO DO WHAT-- FEELS RIGHT COMES FROM OUR DEEP-SEATED FEAR OF BEING WRONG AND MAKING MISTAKES.-- IN ZEN, WE HAVE A REMARKABLY SIMILAR TERM, 'SEEKING MIND.' THIS IS A CONDITION-- OF CONSTANTLY SEEKING OUTSIDE THE PRESENT MOMENT. WE ARE EXCEEDINGLY INSECURE--, FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE DO NOT KNOW. CONTINUALLY WE WANT MORE INFORMATION AND MORE-- EXPERIENCE TO PROVE THAT WE DO KNOW. THE PROBLEM IS THAT ONE ANSWER IS SIMPLY-- THE SEED FOR THE NEXT QUESTION--------A NEVER ENDING CYCLE OF ILLUSION. IN ZEN-- WE SAY "TAKE A STEP OFF A 100 FOOT POLE." TO TRULY AWAKEN TO THE NATURE OF REALITY-- IT IS NECESSARY TO-LET GO OF WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW. A GREAT LEAP-- OF FAITH IS REQUIRED TO TAKE-US FROM THE 'KNOWN TO THE UNKNOWN.'------------------------------------------------------------------ A COROLLARY TO THIS IS-- ALEXANDER'S DISCOVERY THAT HE-ONLY HAD TO THINK OF RECITING AND IT WOULD AFFECT-- THE PHYSICAL USE OF HIS BODY. HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST WESTERNERS, AT LEAST IN-- THE MODERN AGE, TO REALISE THAT MIND AND BODY ARE ONE. THIS IS A TEACHING, THOUGH--, WHICH HAS EXISTED IN BUDDHISM FOR 2500 YEARS. IN ZEN WE ARE TAUGHT TO SEE WITH-- THE WHOLE BODY, LIKEWISE TO HEAR - SMELL - TASTE - FEEL AND THINK WITH THE WHOLE-- BODY. WE ARE ASSURED THAT IF WE PRACTICE THIS WAY SINGLE-MINDEDLY WE WILL ATTAIN-- SATORI, LIBERATION FROM THE ILLUSION OF SELF.------------------------------------------------------------------ THE SIX SENSE FUNCTIONS-- (INCLUDING THINKING) WORK AUTOMATICALLY. NO ONE HAS EVER HAD TO TRAIN THEMSELVES-- IN ORDER TO SEE OR HEAR OR SMELL. MOREOVER, THERE IS NO CENTRAL ORGANISING FUNCTION-- (SELF) WITHIN US WHICH CONTROLS US. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE EYES ARE OPEN, THERE-- IS NOTHING INSIDE OF US WHICH CAN GIVE THE ORDER NOT TO SEE. IF THE EYES ARE-- OPEN, THERE IS SEEING.-EVEN IF WE HAVE NEVER SEEN A CERTAIN OBJECT BEFORE, WE-- CAN RECOGNISE IT INSTANTLY. LIKEWISE WITH THE EARS. NO MATTER HOW MANY SOUNDS-- WE MIGHT HEAR AT ONE TIME, THEY DO NOT GET JUMBLED UP INTO ONE NOISE. THERE-- IS NOTHING MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN THE POWERS OF THESE SENSE FUNCTIONS. WE DO NOT-- EVEN REALLY KNOW WHAT THOUGHT IS OR WHERE IT IS LOCATED.------------------------------------------------------------------ THIS BRINGS US BACK TO-- THE FACT THAT WE CAN ONLY THINK ONE THOUGHT AT A TIME. ONE THOUGHT MUST DISAPPEAR-- BEFORE ANOTHER CAN ARISE. THIS INCLUDES THE THOUGHT OF 'ME.' TO THINK "I AM-- SEEING SUCH AND SUCH" IS, IN FACT, TWO THOUGHTS. CONSEQUENTLY THE SIGNIFICANCE-- OF MIND AND BODY BEING ONE UNITY IS THAT WHEN THERE IS SEEING, IT ISN'T ME WHO-- SEES, BUT RATHER THAT THERE IS ONLY SEEING, NO SEER AND NOTHING SEEN. WHEN THERE-- IS THINKING, THERE IS ONLY THOUGHT--NO THINKER AND NOTHING THOUGHT OF. THIS-- IS OUR REALITY NOW, MOMENT TO MOMENT. IT MEANS THAT WE ARE ALWAYS ONE WITH OUR-- ENVIRONMENT.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- HUMAN BEINGS ARE-- AWARE THAT-SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THEIR CONDITION; THEY FEEL AT ODDS WITH THEMSELVES-- AND OTHERS, OUT OF TOUCH WITH THEIR INNER NATURE AND DISORIENTED. CONFLICT AND-- A LACK OF SYMPATHY SEEM TO CHARACTERISE OUR EXISTENCE. YET WE ARE CONSTANTLY-- SEEKING TO UNITE THE MULTIPLICITY OF PHENOMENA AND REDUCE THEM TO SOME ORDERED-- WHOLE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4 IF ONLY WE COULD REALISE-- THAT EVERYTHING IS ONE! THAT EACH MOMENT AS-IT-IS IS THE RESULT WHICH WE ARE-- SEEKING------------------------------------------------------------------! ASTRONOMERS ESTIMATE THAT-- THE MILKY WAY WITH ITS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF STARS IS REVOLVING AT THE SPEED-- OF 500,000 MILES PER HOUR AROUND ITS CENTRE. AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL, BIOLOGISTS-- TELLS US THAT 98% OF THE ATOMS IN THE HUMAN BODY ARE REPLACED IN LESS THAN ONE-- YEAR AND THAT WITHIN THE SPAN OF FOUR YEARS EVERY SINGLE ATOM OF THE HUMAN BODY-- IS REPLACED AT LEAST ONCE. YET NO ONE IS CONSCIOUS OF THESE FACTS IN THEIR EVERYDAY-- LIFE. IN THE SAME WAY NO ONE IS AWARE OF THE EXTREMELY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AT-- WHICH THOUGHT ARISES. IN THE BUDDHIST TEACHING, THERE ARE SAID TO BE THOUSANDS-- OF CHANGES PER SECOND- A CONSTANT FLUX OF CHANGE. WHILE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO-- CHANGE-THAT REALITY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO STOP INTERFERING WITH IT BY TRYING TO-- USE IT FOR OUR OWN ILLUSORY ADVANTAGE. THIS BRINGS US TO THE CORRELATION BETWEEN-- THE 'NON-DOING' OF INHIBITION AND ZAZEN.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "ONCE SOMETHING-- IS PERCEIVED-------------------------------------------------------------------------- IT IS ALREADY---- PAST. FOR THIS REASON------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE MOMENT---- NOW IS UNKNOWABLE.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"  CENTRAL TO THE TEACHING-- OF BUDDHISM IS THE LAW OF CAUSE AND EFFECT. PAST CAUSES HAVE CREATED THE PRESENT-- RESULT. THE PRESENT RESULT WILL BE THE CAUSE OF FUTURE RESULTS. MY ZEN MASTER-- ALWAYS SAYS THAT IF-WE WANT TO KNOW OUR CONDITION FIVE, TEN OR EVEN TWENTY YEARS-- FROM NOW, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT OUR CONDITION NOW. EACH TIME WE PUT OFF-- SOMETHING WE KNOW WE-OUGHT TO DO, WE CREATE THE STIMULUS FOR PUTTING IT OFF-- AGAIN. CONVERSELY, EACH TIME WE WITHHOLD CONSENT TO REACT IN A HABITUAL MANNER--, WE BREAK A LINK IN THE CHAIN WHICH BINDS US.------------------------------------------------------------------ IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU-- WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE, YOU MUST DO IT NOW. ESSENTIALLY THE GREATEST CHANGE-- WE CAN MAKE IS TO GIVE UP SEEKING RESULTS ELSEWHERE AND SIMPLY ACCEPT OUR REALITY-- AS IT IS NOW. ZAZEN IS THE PRACTICE OF ABANDONING OURSELVES TO THE PRESENT MOMENT.-- IF WE CAN LET GO OF OUR OPINIONS AND IDEAS IN THE FORM OF EXPECTATIONS, INTENTIONS--, AND DESIRE FOR MEANING, WE CAN SEE THAT EACH MOMENT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE SEEKING--, EVEN IF WE ARE ANXIOUS OR CONFUSED. THIS ALSO INCLUDES, OF COURSE, REFLECTING-- ON THE PAST AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE, YET WITH THE DETACHMENT OF KNOWING-- THAT THERE IS NEVER ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE MOMENT 'NOW.'------------------------------------------------------------------ ALEXANDER DISCOVERED IN-- THE COURSE OF SEEKING FOR A SOLUTION TO HIS VOCAL PROBLEM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY-- AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT TO INHIBIT HIS HABITUAL RESPONSE OF 'DOING' WHAT FELT-- RIGHT.-THIS WAS THE FIRST STEP. OTHERS HAVE SINCE CALLED THIS 'LETTING YOURSELF-- BE.' BY STOPPING THE UNCONSCIOUS TENDENCY TO DEPEND ON HIS HABITUAL FEELINGS-- OF RIGHTNESS, HE COULD GO ON TO THE SECOND STEP. THIS WAS TO GIVE A SERIES OF-- REASONED-OUT GUIDING ORDERS. IN THIS WAY HE WAS ABLE TO-ACHIEVE HIS END NOT --BY DOING IT, BUT BY ALLOWING IT TO HAPPEN. HE HAD REALISED THAT MIND AND BODY-- ARE ONE. BY RESISTING THE IMPULSE TO 'DO' AND THEN PROJECTING THROUGH THOUGHT-- THE APPROPRIATE DIRECTIONS, HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE HIMSELF A NEW EXPERIENCE. LATER-- HE ALWAYS EMPHASISED THAT BY WITHHOLDING CONSENT TO DO WHAT FEELS RIGHT, THE-- ENDS WOULD COME OF THEMSELVES.------------------------------------------------------------------ IN ZEN, THE BUDDHIST TEACHING-- SERVES THE PURPOSE OF GUIDING ORDERS OR DIRECTIONS. IN FACT WE REFER TO THE-- TEACHING AS 'A FINGER POINTING AT THE MOON.' THE 'MOON' IS LIBERATION, AWAKENING-- TO THE TRUE NATURE OF THE SELF. THE TEACHINGS OF IMPERMANENCE, NO-SELF, AND-- THE TIMELESS, TRANQUIL NATURE OF THE UNKNOWABLE MOMENT 'NOW', ALL POINT TO THE-- NECESSITY OF FORGETTING THE EGO-SELF. THE PRECEPTS AND THE BODHISATTVA VOWS--- ON ONE HAND, AND THE PRACTICE OF ZAZEN ON THE OTHER, PROVIDE THE MEANS WHEREBY-- TO ATTAIN IT. IN ANY CASE, IT IS THE MOON WHICH IS THE GOAL AND NOT THE FINGER.-- AS IN THE ALEXANDER WORK, INEVITABLY THERE IS A TENDENCY AT THE BEGINNING TO-- 'DO' THE PRACTICE OF DIRECTIONS. HOWEVER, WITH TIME AND PERSEVERANCE, TOGETHER-- WITH A SKILFUL TEACHER, THE HABIT OF 'DOING' WILL GIVE WAY TO 'JUST BEING.'-- THIS IS THE ABILITY TO DEVOTE OURSELVES COMPLETELY TO EACH TASK SIMPLY FOR ITS-- OWN SAKE. NO LONGER IS THERE FINGER OR MOON, FOR WE REALISE THAT ESSENTIALLY-- MOON AND FINGER ARE ONE. WE ARE THEN FREE TO WORK---0% FOR THE SAKE OF ALL LIVING-- BEINGS.------------------------------------------------------------------ IT IS NOT MY INTENTION-- TO SAY THAT ZEN AND THE ALEXANDER TECHNIQUE ARE THE SAME. CERTAINLY DIFFERENT-- PEOPLE WILL VIEW THEM IN DIFFERENT WAYS. PERHAPS MANY WILL THINK I AM TRYING-- TO COMPARE TWO THINGS WHICH ARE ON COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEVELS. HOWEVER, I DO-- THINK THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY CAN BE COMPATIBLE PRACTICES AND EVEN BE COMPLEMENTARY-- IN A BENEFICIAL MANNER. ALEXANDER DID SPEAK OF RELIGION IN A WAY STRIKINGLY-- SIMILAR TO ZEN WHEN HE SAID:--------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE ESSENCE OF-- THE RELIGIOUS OUTLOOK IS THAT RELIGION SHOULD NOT BE KEPT IN A COMPARTMENT BY-- ITSELF, BUT THAT IT SHOULD BE THE EVER PRESENT GUIDING PRINCIPLE OF LIFE UNDERLYING-- THE "DAILY ROUND", THE "COMMON TASK". SO ALSO IT IS POSSIBLE TO APPLY THIS PRINCIPLE-- OF LIFE IN THE DAILY ROUND OF ONE'S ACTIVITIES WITHOUT INVOLVING A LOSS OF ATTENTION-- IN THESE ACTIVITIES.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------5 THIS IS THE WAY OF 'EVERYDAY-- MIND'.------------------------------------------------------------------ ZEN IS THE PRACTICE AND-- REALISATION OF TRANSCENDING THE DUALISM OF SELF-AND-OTHER THROUGH ATTENTION---TO ALL ACTIVITIES IN-OUR EVERYDAY LIFE. MANY PEOPLE ASSOCIATE ZEN WITH A CERTAIN-- POSTURE OF SITTING CROSS-LEGGED, BUT THIS IS MERELY A POSITION OF 'MECHANICAL-- ADVANTAGE.' THIS WOULD BE AKIN TO THINKING THAT THE 'MONKEY POSITION' IS THE-- ALEXANDER TECHNIQUE. IN FACT--ZAZEN IS NOT MEDITATION. ZAZEN IS ZAZEN. IT IS-- BOTH THE END AS WELL AS THE MEANS BY-WHICH TO FORGET THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN-- SELF AND MEDITATION. IN THIS CONNECTION, ALEXANDER WAS POSSIBLY RIGHT WHEN HE-- WROTE:--------------------------------------------------------------------------- YOU SEE, A PERSON-- CANNOT CAPITULATE TO SUBCONSCIOUS GUIDANCE TO THE EXTENT WHICH 'MEDITATION'-- DEMANDS IN PRACTICE, WITHOUT SERIOUSLY AFFECTING THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL SELF IN-- REACTION TO LIVING------------------------------------------------------------------------------.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------6 ZEN IS TO FORGET THE SELF-- WHETHER SITTING STILL OR IN ACTIVITY. ZEN IS TO BREATHE WITH THE WHOLE BODY--, TO WORK, LAUGH, PLAY, AND CRY WITH THE WHOLE BODY. YET TO TRULY MAKE THAT OUR-- OWN AND NOT SIMPLY GET STUCK IN INTELLECTUAL UNDERSTANDING REQUIRES-GREAT EFFORT.------------------------------------------------------------------ AS WE APPROACH THE END-- OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, THE WORLD IS UNDERGOING TREMENDOUS CHANGE. THERE IS-- A WIDE ARRAY OF EXTREMELY SERIOUS PROBLEMS FACING HUMAN LIFE ON THIS PLANET--------WIDESPREAD-- DESTRUCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, OVERPOPULATION, AIDS, SEVERE FAMINE AND POVERTY--, UNPRECEDENTED CRIME AND VIOLENCE. WHAT WILL BE THE FUTURE ROLE OF SPIRITUALITY?-- CAN THE ALEXANDER WORK PROVIDE A SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE TO HELP US FACE THESE-- PROBLEMS? TOWARDS THE END OF HIS LIFE, ALEXANDER SAID, "AFTER WORKING FOR A-- LIFETIME IN THIS-NEW FIELD, I AM CONSCIOUS THAT THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED IS BUT-- A BEGINNING." HE KNEW THAT THE "KNOWLEDGE OF THE SELF IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL-- OTHER." WHAT NEW HORIZONS ARE THERE FOR THE ALEXANDER WORK? CAN IT PROVIDE THE-- MEANS WHEREBY PEOPLE CAN LEARN TO STOP THE INCREASING GREED FOR INSTANT GRATIFICATION--, FOR OUR CONSTANT DESIRE TO KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT? CAN IT TRULY ENHANCE THE-- KNOWLEDGE OF THE SELF?------------------------------------------------------------------ FOR ME IT IS CLEAR THAT-- ALEXANDER PUT HIS FINGER DIRECTLY ON THE PROBLEM WHEN HE SAID, "YOU WANT TO-- FEEL OUT WHETHER-YOU ARE RIGHT OR NOT. I AM GIVING YOU A CONCEPTION TO ERADICATE-- THAT. I DON'T WANT YOU TO CARE A DAMN IF YOU'RE RIGHT OR NOT. DIRECTLY YOU DON'T-- CARE IF YOU'RE RIGHT OR NOT, THE IMPEDING OBSTACLE IS GONE.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"7 THAT OBSTACLE IS NOTHING-- OTHER THAN THE EGO-SELF.--------------------------------------------------------------------- - DAIGAKU RUMME---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ENDNOTES--------------------------------------------------------------------- ARMSTRONG, KAREN,--- A-- HISTORY OF GOD----, ALFRED A.
