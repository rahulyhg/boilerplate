COPYRIGHT 2003 AMANDA BENNETT -- ALL RIGHTS RESERVED---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- T-----------HIS IS THE TIME OF YEAR THAT THE WARM------ WEATHER IS WANING, YOU BEGIN TO NOTICE THE SMELL OF BURNING LEAVES AND------ RIPENING APPLES. THE CLEAR COOL BREEZE IS ON YOUR FACE FIRST THING IN THE------ MORNING, AND THE CHILDREN HAVE NEW ENERGY AND INTEREST IN THE SEASON.------ AUTUMN IS HERE AND ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL? A TIME FOR HARVESTING, CANNING------, PRESERVING AND GETTING STOCKED UP FOR WINTER -- AND THE PERFECT TIME FOR------ REFLECTING ON THE MANY THINGS FOR WHICH WE SHOULD BE THANKFUL.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I NUMBER AMONG THESE: GOD------, OUR FAMILY, OUR HOME, OUR LOVE AND OUR GREAT COUNTRY. WE HAVE INDEED BEEN------ BLESSED IN THIS COUNTRY, AS WERE OUR FOREFATHERS AND THE EARLY CELEBRANTS------ OF THAT FIRST THANKSGIVING IN AMERICA -- BOTH THE PILGRIMS AND THE INDIANS------ THAT SHARED THE MEAL AND CELEBRATION TOGETHER. AT OUR HOUSE, WE USE THIS------ TIME OF GRATITUDE AND COUNTING OUR BLESSINGS TO STUDY THAT FIRST------ THANKSGIVING AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR HOMESCHOOL STUDIES.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AS WITH ANY UNIT STUDY TOPIC------, I TRY-TO PICK OUT ALL OF THE IMPORTANT SUBTOPICS, CROSSING THE CURRICULUM------ SPECTRUM MANY TIMES. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN STUDYING THANKSGIVING, THERE IS------ PLENTY OF HISTORICAL INFORMATION TO EXAMINE, ALONG WITH GEOGRAPHY (OCEAN------ CROSSINGS, CONTINENTS, CLIMATES), SCIENCE (PLANT VARIETIES, GROWTH------, PROPAGATION, SOME OF THE SICKNESSES OF THE TIME, ANIMAL LIFE IN THE------ REGION), ART (N.C. WYETH'S PAINTINGS, CLOTHING OF THE TIME, CRAFTS), AND------ READING (BOTH FICTION AND NONFICTION BOOKS).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHEN I FIRST BEGAN PREPARING------ A UNIT STUDY ON THANKSGIVING, I HAD THE INCORRECT NOTION THAT MY------ UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PERIOD OF AMERICAN HISTORY WAS FAIRLY COMPLETE. I------ WAS CERTAINLY PROVEN WRONG AS WE PROGRESSED THROUGH OUR STUDY! I HAD NOT------ REALIZED THE EXTENT OF THE SACRIFICE MADE BY THE PILGRIMS OVER THAT------ 13 YEAR PERIOD, TRAVELING TO HOLLAND FOR YEARS, AND THEN FINALLY RETURNING------ TO ENGLAND TO-TAKE PART IN THE COLONIZATION OF AMERICA. I NEVER REALLY-------KNEW OR UNDERSTOOD THE ORIGIN OF THE----- "KING JAMES-----" VERSION OF THE------ BIBLE AND HOW IT WAS CONNECTED TO THE SEPARATISTS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EACH YEAR, WE FOCUS ON------ DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE EVENT. THIS YEAR, WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WAS------ INVOLVED IN THEIR SURVIVAL IN A NEW LAND -- WHEN WE STARTED MAKING OUR------ LIST OF WHAT WE WOULD DO IF WE WERE THE PILGRIMS, MY SON CHIMED IN----------- "FIND A WALMART-----!" THE REALITY OF BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE------ TO MAINTAIN YOUR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, GIVING UP WHAT WAS SO FAMILIAR AND------ COMFORTABLE TO GO TO AN UNKNOWN DESTINY WAS PRETTY AMAZING TO THEM. THIS------ WAS EXACTLY THE CONCEPT THAT I WANTED THEM TO UNDERSTAND--- -- THAT------ SACRIFICES ARE OFTENTIMES MADE FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN, AND TO TRUST IN------ THE LORD TO LEAD AND PROTECT YOU.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ AS WE WORK OUR WAY THROUGH------------------------------------------------------------- THIS STUDY---------------, WE HAVE MANY, MANY ACTIVITIES AND STUDIES THAT WE ENJOY. FOR ------EXAMPLE, A POPULAR QUESTION HAS BEEN OVER THE DIFFERENCE IN INDIAN CORN------ AND TABLE CORN, AS WE KNOW IT. THIS OPENS THE DOOR TO AN OPPORTUNITY TO------ HELP THEM LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN PLANT VARIETIES AND ABOUT------ THE GARDENING PRACTICES OF BOTH THE PILGRIMS AND THE INDIANS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOT ONLY ARE WE LOOKING AT------ SOME OF THEIR SURVIVAL GARDENING, WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO GET A BETTER------ UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT TYPES OF SHELTER THEY BUILT,-WHAT KINDS OF SICKNESS------ THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH AND WHY WE DON'T-HAVE THOSE ILLNESSES TODAY. THERE-------ARE MANY ASPECTS OF THEIR DAILY LIVING THAT WE CAN'T EASILY RELATE TO FROM------ OUR OWN EXPERIENCE, AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE CHILDREN TO----------- "SEE-----" WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE THEN, THE TOOLS THEY USED, THE THINGS-------THEY DID WITHOUT, THE-RESPONSIBILITIES OF EACH FAMILY MEMBER, AND THE------ IMPORTANCE OF THEIR FAITH AND TRUST IN GOD TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR NEEDS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ONE OF THE BOOKS THAT-OPENED------ MY EYES TO A BROADER VIEW OF THE POLITICS AND HISTORY OF THE PILGRIMS'------ JOURNEYS WAS---- SAGA-OF THE PILGRIMS: FROM EUROPE TO THE NEW WORLD-----------, BY JOHN HARRIS (PUBLISHED BY GLOBE PEQUOT PRESS). THIS BOOK, WRITTEN FOR------ THE SEVENTH GRADE AND UP, IS VERY INTERESTING READING AND CERTAINLY------ PRESENTED A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THESE RELIGIOUS OUTCASTS. I RECOMMEND THAT------ BOTH PARENTS AND THE OLDER CHILDREN READ THIS ONE -- IT IS A VERY------ INFORMATIVE AND INTERESTING BOOK TO SHARE AND DISCUSS. FOR THE YOUNGER------ CHILDREN, A COMPARABLE BOOK MIGHT BE---- IF YOU SAILED ON THE MAYFLOWER IN----------- 1620, BY ANN MCGOVERN (PUBLISHED BY SCHOLASTIC).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AS WE STUDY THE PILGRIMS AND------ THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS----- "NEW BEGINNING-----", THE CHARACTERS OF------ THE PEOPLE AND SOME OF THE FLAVOR OF THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS, IDEAS, WORK------ ETHIC, AND HUMOR COME TO LIGHT, AND ARE APPRECIATED BY THOSE INVOLVED IN------ THE STUDY. WHEN THEIR FIRST WINTER IS REFLECTED UPON, ONE CAN'T HELP BUT------ FEEL THE LOSS OF SO MANY LOVED ONES ON A PERSONAL LEVEL.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE RESOURCEFULNESS AND------ FORESIGHT OF THESE RELIGIOUS OUTCASTS HELPED LAY SOME SECURE AND STRONG------ FOUNDATIONS FOR OUR COUNTRY. WHEN THEY TOOK THE TIME AND PAINSTAKING------ EFFORT TO WRITE AND BRING TO ACCEPTANCE THE MAYFLOWER COMPACT, THEY------ UNKNOWINGLY DEVELOPED THE LONG-LASTING CONCEPT OF FREEDOMS AND RIGHTS THAT------ WE AMERICANS ENJOY AND EXPECT. PEOPLE TEND TO DEVELOP A MUCH DEEPER------ APPRECIATION OF THESE FREEDOMS WHEN THEY GET SOME HANDS-ON EXPOSURE TO------ JUST EXACTLY WHAT PRICES HAVE BEEN PAID TO OBTAIN AND PROTECT THOSE------ FREEDOMS, AND IT IS MY GOAL THAT THIS STUDY WILL HELP THE CHILDREN DEVELOP------ A SOLID UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES AND IDEALS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AS YOU BEGIN A UNIT STUDY------ ABOUT THANKSGIVING, TRY TO INCLUDE AS MANY INTERESTING BOOKS AND------ ACTIVITIES AS POSSIBLE. CONSIDER WRITING TO THE LIVING HISTORY MUSEUM------, PLIMOTH PLANTATION, FOR ADDITIONAL MATERIALS AND IDEAS. THEIR ADDRESS IS ------PLIMOTH PLANTATION, PUBLIC RELATIONS DEPARTMENT, P.O. BOX ------PLYMOUTH------, MA------- IF YOU CANNOT VISIT PLIMOTH PLANTATION IN PERSON (SOME OF US------ LIVE A BIT FAR TO DO THAT!), THERE IS A VIDEO THAT MANY LIBRARIES CARRY------ TITLED:-------- "PLIMOTH PLANTATION: A VISIT---------", PRODUCED BY------ VIDEOTOURS IN THEIR HISTORY COLLECTION.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ENJOY THIS SEASON OF GIVING THANKS AND BRINGING THE HARVEST HOME. THERE IS------ SO MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR, AND AS HOMESCHOOLERS, WE HAVE EVEN MORE TO BE------ THANKFUL FOR -- THE CHANCE TO REALLY KNOW OUR CHILDREN AND WALK THE WALK------ WITH THEM, SHARING AND-CARING AND MOTIVATING AND LEARNING BESIDE THEM.------ ENJOY THE ADVENTURE, AND MAY YOU AND YOUR FAMILY BE ABUNDANTLY BLESSED-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
