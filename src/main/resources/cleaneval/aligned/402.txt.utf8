IS SOMETIMES--------- EASY TO FORGET THAT EPA REGION 2 EMPLOYEES, WORKING VIRTUALLY IN THE SHADOW--------- OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, WERE AS PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY THE COLLAPSE--------- OF THE TOWERS AS ANYONE IN LOWER MANHATTAN.------------------------------------- "OH MY GOD, LOOK AT THAT PLANE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!"  FOR MANY REGION 2 EMPLOYEES, THE WORK DAY WAS JUST GETTING UNDER----- WAY ON SEPTEMBER 11 WHEN THE FIRST AIRPLANE HIT THE WORLD TRADE----- CENTER. BONNIE BELLOW, REGIONAL COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, WAS AT----- A COFFEE CART ON THE CORNER OF READE STREET AND BROADWAY WHEN----- THE FIRST PLANE HIT.-----------  BELLOW RECALLS:----- "SOMEBODY BEHIND ME ON LINE YELLED-----, `OH----- MY GOD, LOOK AT THAT PLANE!' WE ALL TURNED. IT WAS GOING SO FAST-----, WE TURNED AND IT HAD GONE BEHIND THE BUILDINGS. THE PLANE ITSELF----- WAS BLOCKED BY THE WOOLWORTH BUILDING, SO WE COULDN'T ACTUALLY----- SEE IT, BUT WITHIN A FEW SECONDS WE HEARD THE EXPLOSION AND THE----- GROUND SHOOK. IT'S A MOMENT THAT WILL, I THINK, BE FOREVER STOPPED----- IN TIME.

ONE OF THEM WAS DEPUTY REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR WILLIAM----- J. MUSZYNSKI, WHO WAS ACTING REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE FIRST----- THREE MONTHS OF THE RESPONSE.----- "WHEN THE SECOND PLANE HIT----------," MUSZYNSKI SAYS,----- "THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT THIS WAS NOT----- AN ACCIDENT. YOU COULD TELL FROM-THE WAY THE PLANE APPROACHED----- THAT IT WAS NO ACCIDENT. THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING BEGAN -----TO BE CONCERNED THAT PERHAPS-THESE (FEDERAL) BUILDINGS WERE ALSO----- TARGETED, AND PEOPLE BEGAN-TO LEAVE THE BUILDING.--------------"  WHILE THE MANHATTAN OFFICE EVACUATED, EPA'S EDISON OFFICE GEARED----- UP.----------  NEIL NORRELL WAS ONE OF-MANY EDISON EMPLOYEES WATCHING THE EVENTS----- UNFOLD ON TV.----- "WHEN THE SECOND PLANE HIT,-----" NORRELL SAYS,---------- "WE JUST STARTED GETTING STUFF READY. WE WEREN'T SURE WHAT----- WE WERE GOING TO DO, BUT WE FIGURED WE'D BE DOING SOMETHING.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"  WITHIN MINUTES, SPRAGUE DISPATCHED THE FIRST CREW OF AGENCY ON-SCENE----- COORDINATORS (OSCS) FROM EDISON TO NEW YORK CITY TO MONITOR AMBIENT----- ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. OSCS MIKE SOLECKI, MIKE FERRIOLA, GAD----- TAWADROS, AND BOB MONTGOMERY WERE A FEW BLOCKS AWAY WHEN THE FIRST----- TOWER BEGAN TO COLLAPSE.---------------  "SOMEONE YELLED-----, `I SMELL GAS, I SMELL GAS' AND EVERYONE----- BEGAN RUNNING,-----" SOLECKI SAYS.----- "THE DUST THERE WAS SO----- THICK, I COULDN'T SEE THE HAND IN FRONT OF MY FACE.---------------"  THE OSCS HAD TO SCRAMBLE JUST TO FIND WHERE NEW YORK CITY HAD----- SET UP ITS TEMPORARY COMMAND CENTER. THE CITY'S STATE-OF-THE-ART----- EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER HAD BEEN LOCATED IN THE WORLD TRADE----- CENTER COMPLEX AND WAS DESTROYED IN THE COLLAPSE, SENDING THE----- MAYOR-AND OTHER TOP OFFICIALS SCURRYING FOR SAFETY. ALL RADIO----- COMMUNICATIONS WERE LOST, AND THE DUST WAS SO BAD, NOT EVEN EPA'S----- SATELLITE PHONES WORKED.----------  OVERCOMING SUCH OBSTACLES, THE OSCS TOOK THE FIRST DUST SAMPLES----- WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO OF THE COLLAPSE.----- "WE DIDN'T REALLY----- HAVE A LOT OF SAMPLING EQUIPMENT,-----" SOLECKI SAYS,----- "SO----- WE WENT TO A LOCAL STORE AND BOUGHT ZIPLOC BAGS. WE HAD TO DO----- THINGS LIKE THAT,-----" HE SAYS.----------  MUSZYNSKI, WHO RETURNED TO HIS OFFICE AFTER SENDING 290 BROADWAY----- EMPLOYEES HOME AND COORDINATED THE REGION 2 RESPONSE THROUGH COMPUTER----- CONTACT WITH SPRAGUE AND PHONE CONTACT WITH EPA HEADQUARTERS-----, POINTS OUT,----- "WHILE MOST PEOPLE WERE GOING AWAY FROM THE SITE-----, OUR EMERGENCY CREWS WERE COMING TOWARD THE SITE. THAT'S PART OF----- THE INITIAL REACTION, AND I THINK IT'S PREDOMINANTLY BECAUSE OF----- THE TRAINING THEY HAVE ABOUT HOW TO RESPOND TO A DISASTER.--------------------"  "IT WASN'T UNTIL WEEKS LATER,-----" SPRAGUE RECALLS,----- "THAT----- I REALIZED, WHEN I FINALLY-HAD SOME TIME TO REALLY THINK, I WONDER----- WHETHER THESE GUYS THOUGHT ABOUT THE DANGER THAT THEY WERE GOING----- INTO. THEY WERE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE HOLLAND TUNNEL. WELL-----, WAS THE HOLLAND TUNNEL GOING TO BE BLOWN UP? WAS THERE SOMETHING----- ELSE THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN? I DIDN'T-EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT.----- THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER THINGS RACING THROUGH MY MIND AT THAT----- TIME.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"  LATER THAT DAY, AFTER THE BUILDINGS COLLAPSED, EPA SENT CREWS FROM----- ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE TEAM (ERT---ALSO LOCATED IN EDISON-----, TO BROOKLYN AND LIBERTY-STATE PARK, JUST ACROSS FROM LOWER MANHATTAN.----- THE BROOKLYN CREW GATHERED DUST AND AIR SAMPLES, THE NEW JERSEY----- TEAM ONLY AIR SAMPLES,----- "BECAUSE THE WIND WASN'T BLOWING THERE----------," MUSZYNSKI REMEMBERS.----------  THREE REGION 2 EMPLOYEES LOST FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE ATTACKS THAT------DAY. MANY OTHERS, INCLUDING OSC STEVE TOUW, LOST DEAR FRIENDS.---------------  "FATHER MYCHAL JUDGE (THE NEW YORK CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT CHAPLAIN----- LISTED AS THE FIRST CASUALTY OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER ATTACKS-----) ACTUALLY MARRIED MY WIFE-AND I,-----" TOUW EXPLAINS.----- "HE----- HAD BEEN THE PARISH PRIEST AT-OUR CHURCH WHEN MY WIFE WAS IN HIGH----- SCHOOL AND WAS VERY ACTIVELY-INVOLVED IN THE PARISH. SO WHEN WE----- GOT ENGAGED, WE IMMEDIATELY CALLED FATHER MYCHAL AND ASKED HIM----- TO COME BACK AND DO THE WEDDING. WHEN I WAS DRIVING HOME ON THE----- NIGHT OF THE 11TH, I GOT HOLD OF MY WIFE ON THE PHONE AND SHE----- TOLD ME SHE HAD HEARD ON THE NEWS THAT FATHER MYCHAL WAS KILLED.----- SO I TOOK THIS RESPONSE VERY PERSONALLY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" WEEK ONE: DIRECTING THE RESPONSE----- FROM EDISON------------ WITH ITS LOWER MANHATTAN HEADQUARTERS OFF-LIMITS FOR NEARLY TWO----- WEEKS, REGION 2 BEGAN 24-HOUR OPERATIONS IN EDISON. BY THE MORNING----- OF SEPTEMBER 12, THE ANALYSIS OF THE BULK DUST SAMPLES TAKEN ON----- THE DAY OF THE ATTACKS WAS COMPLETED, SHOWING ASBESTOS LEVELS----- RANGING FROM NON-DETECTS TO 4.5 PERCENT (1 PERCENT IS THE LEVEL----- AT WHICH DUST IS CONSIDERED TO BE ASBESTOS-CONTAINING). THAT DAY-----, EPA ON-SCENE COORDINATORS ESTABLISHED NINE MONITORING STATIONS----- IN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AREA.----------- ALTHOUGH EPA EVENTUALLY MONITORED FOR HUNDREDS OF CONTAMINANTS-----, OSC CHRIS JIMENEZ, WHO ARRIVED AT GROUND ZERO ON SEPTEMBER----- 12, EXPLAINS HOW THEY FIRST APPROACHED THE DISASTER.----- "THE WAY----- WE STARTED WAS, OK, WE KNOW ASBESTOS IS AN ISSUE. WE KNOW VOCS----- (VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS) ARE GOING TO BE AN ISSUE BECAUSE----- OF THE BURNING. WE ALSO KNEW THERE ARE OTHER CHEMICALS THAT YOU'LL----- FIND AS A RESULT OF FIRES----- - ACID GASES AS AN EXAMPLE. WE----- KNEW WE WERE GOING TO WANT TO SAMPLE THOSE IMMEDIATELY.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" JIMENEZ SAYS THAT ONE OF THE FIRST DIFFICULTIES WAS IN ESTABLISHING----- AIR MONITORING LOCATIONS.----- "WE COULDN'T REALLY GET VERY CLOSE----- BECAUSE THE POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS WERE TRYING TO KEEP EVERYONE----- BACK. IT WAS INCREDIBLY SMOKY. WE ENDED UP HAVING TO RUN BECAUSE----- THERE WERE ALARMS GOING OFF FROM BUILDINGS POSSIBLY COMING DOWN.----------------" FROM EDISON, THE REGION 2 LEADERSHIP WORKED WITH EPA HEADQUARTERS-----, THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, AND NEW YORK CITY AND----- STATE AGENCIES TO COORDINATE A MULTI-FACETED RESPONSE, ACTING----- ON FEMA MISSION ASSIGNMENTS UNDER THE FEDERAL RESPONSE PLAN TRIGGERED----- BY THE DISASTER DECLARATION ISSUED BY PRESIDENT BUSH THE NIGHT----- OF THE ATTACKS.------------ IN ADDITION TO THE MONITORING ALREADY UNDER WAY, EPA ASSUMED LEAD----- RESPONSIBILITY FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL, STREET----- VACUUMING AND POWER WASHING, AND THE OPERATION OF WASH STATIONS----- FOR WORKERS AND TRUCKS AT GROUND ZERO AND THE LANDFILL. (STRIKE----- TEAMS FROM THE U.S. COAST GUARD'S NATIONAL STRIKE FORCE PROVIDED----- ENORMOUS SUPPORT----- - BOTH MANPOWER AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE---------- - AS EPA CARRIED OUT ITS MISSION ASSIGNMENTS.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ALONG WITH ITS CRITICAL ROLE IN PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY-----, EPA TOOK PART IN HELPING WALL STREET GET UP AND RUNNING. ON SEPTEMBER----- 12, EPA BEGAN VACUUMING THE STREETS, USING SPECIALLY EQUIPPED----- TRUCKS TO REMOVE DUST AND DEBRIS FROM LOWER MANHATTAN'S FINANCIAL----- DISTRICT. OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WITH HELP FROM THE COAST GUARD-----, EPA ALSO ESCORTED FINANCIAL DISTRICT EXECUTIVES BACK TO THEIR----- OFFICES TO RETRIEVE BACKUP COMPUTER SYSTEM FILES.----------- OSC ANDY CONFORTINI EXPLAINS:----- "THE BOND MARKET ASSOCIATION----- WOULD FAX OVER A LIST OF THE FIRMS THAT NEEDED TO GET INTO THEIR----- BUILDINGS. WE WOULD SET UP A SCHEDULE TO MEET UP WITH THEM OUTSIDE----- THE GROUND ZERO PERIMETER, GET THEM ONTO OUR VEHICLES, TAKE THEM----- DOWN TO THEIR BUILDINGS, GIVE THEM A MASK AND TAKE THEM WHERE----- THEY HAD TO BE TO GET THEIR BACKUP SYSTEMS AND FILES. THE COAST -----GUARD WOULD GO THERE THE DAY BEFORE TO EVALUATE THE BUILDING FOR---------- `IMMEDIATELY DANGEROUS TO LIFE AND HEALTH' CONDITIONS---------- - COMBUSTIBLE GAS, LOW OXYGEN, HIGH CO2, ANY KIND OF VOLATILE ORGANICS.----- THEY WOULD DO THAT RECON AND REPORT BACK TO ME. THERE WERE A LOT----- OF NATURAL GAS LEAKS, BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE BUILDING THAT WE----- NEVER GOT INTO (THE DEUTSCHE BANK BUILDING ADJACENT TO THE WTC----- SITE) BECAUSE OF STRUCTURAL CONCERNS AND BECAUSE OF GAS LEAKS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" EPA ADMINISTRATOR WHITMAN TOURED GROUND ZERO ON SEPTEMBER 13, ACCOMPANIED----- BY MUSZYNSKI.----- "THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT ONE OR TWO OF THE----- BUILDINGS HAD THE DANGER OF COLLAPSING,-----" MUSZYNSKI RECALLS.---------- "AS WE WERE WALKING DOWN THERE THEY HAD ONE OR TWO ALARMS.----- CAN YOU IMAGINE EVACUATING AND SAYING, NO, IT'S OK TO GO BACK----- TO WORK, AND YOU GO BACK TO WORK AND THE ALARM GOES OFF AND YOU----- HAVE TO EVACUATE AGAIN? TO THINK ABOUT THE COURAGE PEOPLE HAD----- TO GO BACK IN THOSE CONDITIONS AND STILL SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS-----, IT WAS INCREDIBLE.----------------"  OVER THE FIRST WEEK OF THE RESPONSE, AS POLICE, FIRE FIGHTERS-----, AND RESCUE WORKERS SEARCHED FOR VICTIMS AMID THE RUBBLE AND BATTLED----- THE FIRES THAT WOULD BURN FOR MONTHS WITHIN THE PILE, EPA EXPANDED----- ITS AMBIENT ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING ACTIVITIES, INCREASING BOTH----- THE NUMBER OF FIXED STATIONS AND THE CONTAMINANTS TO BE PROBED.----- ON-SCENE COORDINATORS WERE ALSO ASSIGNED TO MONITOR CONDITIONS----- AT THE FRESH KILLS LANDFILL, WHERE DEBRIS FROM THE WORLD TRADE----- CENTER WAS TRANSPORTED FOR SIFTING BY FEDERAL CRIME INVESTIGATORS-----, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF EPA'S CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE CHIEF PURPOSE OF EPA'S MONITORING WAS TO ASSESS HEALTH RISKS----- FOR THE WORKERS AT GROUND ZERO AND FOR THOSE WHO WOULD SOON RETURN----- TO WORK AND LIVE IN LOWER MANHATTAN. EPA LABS AND PRIVATE LABS----- UNDER CONTRACT TO THE AGENCY ANALYZED AIR AND DUST SAMPLES FOR----- ASBESTOS AND A HOST OF OTHER CONTAMINANTS, THEN TURNED THE DATA----- OVER TO AN INTERAGENCY TEAM OF SCIENTISTS. THE TEAM INCLUDED DORE----- LAPOSTA, THEN ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE REGION'S DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL----- SCIENCE AND ASSESSMENT (DESA).-----------  THE CHALLENGE WAS TO DETERMINE AT WHICH LEVEL EACH CONTAMINANT----- POSED A HEALTH CONCERN, SO THAT THE DATA COULD BE REPORTED MEANINGFULLY.----- HEALTH-BASED BENCHMARKS HAD NEVER BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR MANY CONTAMINANTS----- BEING MONITORED.------------ FOR EXAMPLE, NO OUTDOOR STANDARDS EXISTED FOR AIRBORNE ASBESTOS----- EXPOSURE, WHICH MORE COMMONLY OCCURS INDOORS. ASBESTOS, A HEAT-RESISTANT----- MATERIAL USED AS FIRE-PROOFING IN PART OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER-----, IS KNOWN TO CAUSE LUNG CANCER AND ASBESTOSIS. EPA TURNED TO A----- NATIONALLY ACCEPTED STANDARD FOR ASBESTOS THAT IS BASED ON LONG-TERM----- INDOOR EXPOSURE: THE ASBESTOS HAZARD EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT (AHERA-----) STANDARD OF 70 STRUCTURES PER SQUARE MILLIMETER, WHICH IS USED----- TO DETERMINE WHETHER CHILDREN MAY RE-ENTER A SCHOOL BUILDING AFTER----- ASBESTOS REMOVAL OR ABATEMENT.---------------- "ONCE WE GOT THE DATA,-----" SAYS LAPOSTA,----- "WE HAD TO----- START JUDGING AND EVALUATING IT AGAINST WHATEVER WE CAME UP WITH----- AS THE BEST PARAMETERS. WE HAD TO WORK WITH THE RISK ASSESSMENT----- PEOPLE AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THE FIELD TO FIGURE OUT, FOR INSTANCE-----, WHETHER THE AHERA STANDARD IS THE RIGHT STANDARD AND WHAT DOES----- THAT MEAN FROM A RISK PERSPECTIVE? AND WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT DIOXIN---------- - DO WE USE A 30-YEAR REMOVAL NUMBER, DO WE USE A ONE-YEAR----- NUMBER, OR DO WE USE AN OSHA (OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION-----) NUMBER? THESE CRITERIA ISSUES BECAME A DATA MANAGEMENT AND ASSESSMENT----- PROBLEM WE HAD TO WORK THROUGH.----------------" SAMPLING QUICKLY EXTENDED FROM AIR AND DUST TO WATER. AFTER A----- HEAVY RAIN PROMPTED CONCERNS THAT HAZARDOUS MATERIAL FROM THE----- COLLAPSED BUILDINGS WAS SEEPING INTO WATER SUPPLIES, EPA SAMPLED----- DRINKING WATER AT 13 DISTRIBUTION POINTS IN NEW YORK CITY AS WELL----- AS WATER PUMPED OUT OF THE PORT AUTHORITY TRANS-HUDSON (PATH-----) TRAIN TUNNELS THAT FLOODED AFTER THE COLLAPSE. DRINKING WATER----- SAMPLING RESULTS SHOWED NO CONTAMINATION AND, IN FACT, THE ONLY----- IMPACT ON WATER DETECTED BY EPA WAS A SMALL AMOUNT-OF TEMPORARILY----- ELEVATED LEVELS OF ASBESTOS AND OTHER COMPOUNDS-IN STORM-DRAIN------RUNOFF IN THE HUDSON-RIVER.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RETURN TO 290 BROADWAY-----------  AS THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT RETURNED TO OPERATION, EPA CONTINUED----- ITS VACUUMING ACTIVITIES. BULK DUST SAMPLING IN AND AROUND GROUND----- ZERO HAD INDICATED AN UNEVEN SPREAD OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING DUST----- IN THE AREA; THE AGENCY DECIDED TO VACUUM ALL PUBLIC SPACES THROUGHOUT----- LOWER MANHATTAN. COORDINATED BY OSC DAN HARKAY, 10 VACUUM TRUCKS----- REMOVED DUST FROM STREETS AND SIDEWALKS, OPEN AREAS SUCH AS PARKS----- AND SANDBOXES, AND FEDERAL BUILDING LOBBIES (INCLUDING 290 BROADWAY-----) INTO WHICH RESPONSE WORKERS HAD CARRIED DUST ON THEIR SHOES.----------  WITH THE LOWER MANHATTAN CLEANUP PROGRESSING QUICKLY, EPA SET----- A RETURN DATE OF SEPTEMBER-24 FOR EMPLOYEES WORKING AT 290 BROADWAY.----- IN THE INTERIM, MUSZYNSKI AND ASSISTANT REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR----- HERB BARRACK WORKED WITH EPA HEADQUARTERS TO RESTORE THE FACILITY'S----- COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES, WHICH WERE LOST WHEN A MAJOR TELEPHONE----- SWITCHING STATION WAS INUNDATED WITH WATER FOLLOWING THE WORLD----- TRADE CENTER COLLAPSE. THEY ALSO ARRANGED THROUGH EPA HEADQUARTERS----- TO PROVIDE TRAUMA COUNSELING FOR REGION 2 EMPLOYEES, ENLISTING----- A MASSACHUSETTS-BASED GROUP WITH BROAD EXPERIENCE IN COUNSELING----- DISASTER VICTIMS.----------------  "THE QUESTION WAS,-----" BARRACK SAYS,----- "SHOULD WE BRING----- EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO THE REGIONAL OFFICE OR TRANSITION BY ANOTHER----- LOCATION FIRST, WHERE THEY WOULDN'T BE IMMEDIATELY CONFRONTED----- WITH GOING BACK TO THE HORRORS THAT THEY EXPERIENCED? WE REACHED----- CONSENSUS THAT IT WAS BETTER TO DO IT OFFSITE.---------------"  THE VOLUNTARY SESSION, HELD AT THE GRAND HYATT IN MID-TOWN MANHATTAN-----, DREW MORE THAN 600 EMPLOYEES----- - ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE----- REGION'S WORKFORCE. THE TRAUMA GROUP ALSO PROVIDED COUNSELORS----- FOR EPA EMPLOYEES RE-ENTERING THEIR LOWER MANHATTAN OFFICES ON----- SEPTEMBER------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WORK AT GROUND ZERO----------------- "THE FIRST DAY YOU CAME IN,-----" NORRELL SAYS ABOUT HIS----- ON-SCENE COORDINATOR EXPERIENCE AT GROUND ZERO,----- "YOU DIDN'T----- HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT. FOR THE FIRST HOUR OR SO YOU FOUND----- YOURSELF FROM TIME TO TIME JUST STARING AT IT, SEEING AND NOT----- BELIEVING. IT WAS ENORMOUS.----------------" OSCS ASSIGNED TO GROUND ZERO CARRIED OUT SEVERAL FUNCTIONS: REMOVING----- HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; MONITORING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN AND----- AROUND THE SITE; ESTABLISHING ON-SITE WASH STATIONS TO DECONTAMINATE----- WORKERS AND TRUCKS INVOLVED IN THE RESCUE AND RECOVERY; CONTRIBUTING----- PERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT TO THE RESCUE EFFORT; AND COMMUNICATING----- WITH RECOVERY WORKERS AND OTHER AGENCIES ABOUT MONITORING RESULTS----- AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY.----------- SOLECKI RECALLS CLIMBING THROUGH GAPS IN AND BELOW THE PILE AT----- GROUND ZERO ALONGSIDE SEARCH-AND-RESCUE PERSONNEL, BEGINNING THE----- THIRD NIGHT.----- "I WENT THROUGH THE HOLE EVERY NIGHT. I WORKED----- A LOT WITH THE USAR (URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE) PEOPLE, AND I ACTUALLY----- WENT THROUGH WITH THEM LOOKING FOR BODIES. THAT WASN'T MY PURPOSE---------- - MY PURPOSE WAS LOOKING FOR HAZMATS ... I DIDN'T REALLY----- FIND ANYTHING AT FIRST BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH RUBBLE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" EPA ON-SCENE COORDINATORS PUMPED APPROXIMATELY 600,000 GALLONS----- OF OIL FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTER SUB-BASEMENTS AND REMOVED A----- HOST OF OTHER HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, SUCH AS DRY CLEANING FLUIDS-----, FIRE EXTINGUISHERS, AND UNDERGROUND-FUEL TANKS. THEY ALSO MONITORED----- FOR FREON R-22 LEAKS FROM THE TRADE CENTER'S ENORMOUS REFRIGERATION----- SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN CITY OFFICIALS POSED THE POSSIBILITY (LATER----- DISPROVED) THAT THIS PARTICULAR FORM OF FREON, WHEN COMBUSTED-----, WOULD FORM THE POISON GAS PHOSGENE.----------- THROUGHOUT EPA'S RESPONSE, ASBESTOS MONITORING REMAINED A TOP----- PRIORITY. TWICE EACH DAY, OSCS COLLECTED SAMPLES FROM MORE THAN---------DIFFERENT FIXED CONTINUOUS AIR MONITORING LOCATIONS IN AND----- AROUND GROUND ZERO. OF THE MORE THAN 9,500 SAMPLES EVENTUALLY----- COLLECTED, ONLY 21 MEASURED ABOVE THE 70-STRUCTURES-PER-SQUARE-MILLIMETER----- LEVEL OF CONCERN. EVEN THOSE 21 SAMPLES DID NOT REFLECT A SIGNIFICANT----- LONG-TERM HEALTH RISK. ASBESTOS EXPOSURE GENERALLY BECOMES A HEALTH----- CONCERN WHEN HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF ASBESTOS FIBERS ARE INHALED----- OVER A LONG PERIOD. ILLNESS IS VERY UNLIKELY TO RESULT FROM A----- SINGLE, HIGH-LEVEL EXPOSURE, OR FROM A SHORT PERIOD OF EXPOSURE----- TO LOWER LEVELS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ALONG WITH ASBESTOS MONITORING, EPA SAMPLED THE AMBIENT AIR FOR----- VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS SUCH AS BENZENE, METALS SUCH AS LEAD-----, AND POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (PAHS), DIOXIN, PARTICULATES-----, SILICA, AND POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCBS).------------ OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WERE SUBSTANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRES----- THAT BURNED AT GROUND ZERO. MONITORING TOOK PLACE IN THE SMOKE----- PLUMES EACH DAY AS THE FIRES BURNED, AND LATER IN THE RECOVERY -----PITS AND AT A NUMBER OF STATIONS RINGING THE GROUND ZERO SITE.----- EARLY ON, EPA FOUND ELEVATED LEVELS OF SOME SUBSTANCES IN THE----- SMOKE ITSELF--BUT THESE LEVELS TAILED OFF-DRAMATICALLY EVEN A -----FEW FEET FROM THE SOURCE OF THE SMOKE. ONCE THE FIRES CEASED-------THE POLLUTANTS FELL TO EITHER EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS----- - WELL----- BELOW EPA'S BENCHMARKS----- - OR TO UNDETECTABLE LEVELS.----------- ALTHOUGH THE RISKS WERE CONSIDERED SHORT-TERM, MANY PEOPLE, INCLUDING----- EPA EMPLOYEES AT 290 BROADWAY, HAD TEARY EYES, SCRATCHY THROATS-----, AND OTHER RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS IN THE EARLY MONTHS WHILE THE FIRES----- WERE RAGING. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WERE INSTRUCTED BY EPA AND----- THE HEALTH AGENCIES TO CONSULT THEIR DOCTORS IF THEY WERE EXPERIENCING----- SYMPTOMS RELATED TO THE DUST AND SMOKE FROM THE FIRES.---------------- "WE WERE GETTING RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF SOME PRETTY HAZARDOUS----- CHEMICALS, BENZENE BEING THE MOST PROMINENT OF THEM,-----" JIMENEZ----- SAYS.----- "RIGHT FROM THE VENTS WE WERE GETTING RELATIVELY HIGH----- LEVELS, BUT IF YOU WOULD TAKE A SAMPLE JUST STEPPING AWAY EVEN----- A COUPLE OF FEET, THE LEVELS WOULD DROP OFF DRAMATICALLY. PLUS-----, PROVIDED YOU WERE WEARING YOUR RESPIRATORY PROTECTION AND CHANGING----- YOUR CARTRIDGES REGULARLY, THE LEVELS OF BENZENE WE WERE FINDING----- WE DIDN'T SEE AS HAZARDOUS TO YOURSELF.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" WHILE OSHA AND NEW YORK CITY, WHICH CONTROLLED THE SITE, HAD RESPONSIBILITY----- FOR ENFORCING SAFETY STANDARDS AT GROUND ZERO, EPA ON-SCENE COORDINATORS----- DID ALL THEY COULD TO ENCOURAGE RESCUE WORKERS TO WEAR RESPIRATORS----- AND OTHER PERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT. EPA CONTRIBUTED TENS----- OF THOUSANDS OF RESPIRATORS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT, USING THE AGENCY'S----- OWN STOCK AND NEW ORDERS FROM VENDORS. NEVERTHELESS, MANY RESCUE----- WORKERS OPTED NOT TO USE THE SAFETY EQUIPMENT.---------------- "FROM DAY ONE, WE SAID YOU GOTTA WEAR RESPIRATORS----------," SPRAGUE RECALLS,----- "AND WE SUPPLIED A LOT OF EQUIPMENT. ...----- THE ISSUE BECAME VERY FRUSTRATING.----------------" JIMENEZ SAYS,----- "GUYS WOULD BE SITTING NEAR A HUGE PLUME OF----- SMOKE WITH NO RESPIRATOR ON, AND YOU'D LOOK AT THEM AND SAY, LISTEN-----, YOU SHOULD BE PUTTING YOUR RESPIRATOR ON. WE PUT OUT PRESS RELEASES----- (ADVISING THAT GROUND ZERO WORKERS WEAR RESPIRATORS). HAVING SAID----- THAT, A BUILDING FALLS, THE BUILDING'S ON FIRE, IT IS MADE WITH----- PLASTICS AND FUEL OILS, IT DOESN'T TAKE A BIT OF COMMON SENSE----- TO REALIZE THAT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE A RESPIRATOR ON.----------------" NORRELL IS PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT IT.----- "THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY----- NOTHING ANYONE COULD HAVE SAID----- - WHETHER YOU'RE EPA OR ANY----- OTHER AGENCY OR PERSON----- - THAT WAS GOING TO STOP ANYBODY FROM----- DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING,-----" HE SAID IN MARCH.----- "CERTAINLY----- NOT DURING THE-FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS-AND PROBABLY EVEN NOT NOW.------FIREMEN ARE STILL DOWN THERE FINDING THEIR BROTHERS. THE ONLY----- THING WE COULD HAVE DONE IS EXACTLY WHAT WE DID, WHICH WAS IDENTIFY----- THE NEED FOR EVERYBODY WHO WAS WORKING-HERE TO WEAR A RESPIRATOR-----, AND THEN DO THE BEST WE COULD IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER FOLKS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" EPA FACED A SIMILAR CHALLENGE AS OSCS WORKED TO INSTALL PERSONAL----- AND TRUCK WASH STATIONS AT THE DISASTER SITE. BY SEPTEMBER----- 19, SEVEN WASH STATIONS WERE IN OPERATION AT GROUND ZERO, AND FIVE----- MORE WOULD BE ADDED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. BUT WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY----- TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE (THE CITY OF NEW YORK CONTROLLED THE SITE-----), ON-SCENE COORDINATORS HAD TO RELY ON THE POWER OF PERSUASION---------- - AND ULTIMATELY THE LURE OF A WARM MEAL.---------------- "MANY, MANY CONFLICTS WERE ALWAYS GOING ON,-----" RECALLS----- JIM DALOIA, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM LEADER.----- "THE CONTRACTORS----- ON THE SITE WOULD SAY, WE WILL BUILD OUR OWN WASH STATION, AND----- BESIDES, THE SITE YOU SELECTED WAS TOO FAR FROM OUR EQUIPMENT.----------------" AS WORK CONTINUED IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER, EPA WORKED TO ERECT----- A 260-FOOT BY 120-FOOT CENTRAL WASH STATION----- - HEATED IN ANTICIPATION----- OF WINTER----- - FOR ALL GROUND ZERO WORKERS. THE TEMPORARY STRUCTURE----- PROVIDED BOOT AND MASK WASHES, HIGH-EFFICIENCY PARTICULATE AIR----- (HEPA) VACUUMS FOR DUSTY CLOTHING--AND SHOWER STALLS AND LOCKERS----- FOR WORKER USE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "WE BUILT THIS THING REALLY BIG,-----" SPRAGUE RECALLS,----- "THINKING----- THAT HALF OF IT WOULD BE USED BY THE CITY FOR SOMETHING, MAYBE----- EITHER FOR FOOD OR FOR AN INDOOR MEMORIAL THAT THE WORKERS FROM----- GROUND ZERO WOULD GET SOME POSITIVE FEELINGS FROM. WHEN THE CITY----- DECIDED TO HAVE THE SALVATION ARMY USE IT FOR FOOD, THAT REALLY----- MADE THE OPERATION GO WELL.----------------------" "WHEN WE FIRST OPENED IT UP, WE HAD A TRICKLE OF PEOPLE COMING----- IN,-----" SAYS JOHN HIGGINS, WHO ACTED AS OPERATIONS CHIEF FOR----- THE REGIONAL RESPONSE.----- "THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY LARGE----- WHITE ELEPHANT. IF WE DIDN'T PARTNER WITH NEW YORK CITY AND THE----- SALVATION ARMY AND GET FOOD IN THERE, FORGET IT.---------------" THE TENT, WHICH ACQUIRED THE NICKNAME----- "TAJ MAHAL-----" AMONG----- WORKERS, EVENTUALLY ATTRACTED MORE THAN 650,000 WORKER-VISITS----- TO ITS WASH STATIONS AND FOOD LINES----- - 6,000 PEOPLE ON ITS----- BUSIEST DAYS.------------ NINE MONTHS AT GROUND ZERO PROVIDED EPA ON-SCENE COORDINATORS----- WITH TECHNICAL, LOGISTICAL, AND PHYSICAL CHALLENGES----- - AND----- HUMAN ONES AS WELL. THIS WAS NOT ONLY-A DISASTER SITE BUT ALSO----- A MURDER SCENE.---------------  "YOU'D SEE THE LOOK IN THE FIRE FIGHTERS' EYES WHENEVER THEY----- WOULD RECOVER SOMEBODY, OR THE POLICE WOULD RECOVER SOMEBODY FROM----- THE UNIFORMED SERVICES,-----" TOUW SAYS.----- "THEY'D HAVE THE----- PROCESSION OF THE FLAG-DRAPED STRETCHER. YOU'D SEE THESE GROWN----- MEN, THESE MUSCULAR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, FIREMEN, AND POLICE----- OFFICERS, HOLDING HANDS SAYING THE LORD'S PRAYER AND CRYING, HUGGING----- EACH OTHER AFTER IT WAS OVER. THINGS LIKE THAT WERE A CONSTANT----- REMINDER OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED.----------------" OSC ARLENE ANDERSON, WHO SPENT A MONTH AND A HALF WORKING AT GROUND----- ZERO, SAYS,----- "I WILL NEVER FORGET THE DAY WHEN THEY FOUND----- THE FIRST HUNDRED VICTIMS IN THE NORTH TOWER. IT WAS AN IMAGE----- THAT WILL ALWAYS STAY WITH ME.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" "THERE WERE DEFINITELY THINGS HERE THAT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D----- HAVE TO SEE, NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO DEAL WITH,-----" NORRELL----- RECALLS.----- "THE HARDEST PART IS WHEN THEY WERE BRINGING FAMILIES----- (OF VICTIMS) THROUGH. YOU REALIZE THAT A WIFE WHO LOST A HUSBAND-----, OR A HUSBAND WHO LOST A WIFE, THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS BIG----- DUSTY PILE OF STEEL THAT HAS SOME SMOKE COMING OUT, AND THAT'S----- IT. THAT'S THE ONLY CLOSURE THEY'RE EVER GOING TO HAVE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" THE LANDFILL------------ ON A WALL IN THE EPA TRAILER AT THE FRESH KILLS LANDFILL ON STATEN----- ISLAND, A MAKESHIFT SIGN WAS SCRAWLED ON DUCT TAPE, READING,--- A----- LITTLE BIT OF HELL ON EARTH----.----------- OSC GREG DEANGELIS EXPLAINS THAT, AS EMOTIONALLY CHARGED-AN ASSIGNMENT----- AS-GROUND ZERO RESCUE AND RECOVERY WAS, WORK AT THE LANDFILL WAS----- PERHAPS EVEN HARDER.----- "THEY WERE SIFTING TO A MUCH FINER DETAIL-----, FINDING MANY, MANY MORE VERY GRAPHIC THINGS,-----" DEANGELIS SAYS.---------- "IT'S ONE THING TO FIND A WHOLE, DEAD BODY, BUT WHEN YOU----- FIND BITS AND PIECES...

THE LANDFILL, OFFICIALLY----- CLOSED TO GARBAGE DISPOSAL JUST A FEW MONTHS EARLIER, BECAME A----- SIFTING AREA FOR INVESTIGATORS HUNTING FOR EVIDENCE FROM THE WORLD----- TRADE CENTER RUBBLE. MOUNTAINS OF DEBRIS WERE HAULED BY BARGE----- FROM MANHATTAN TO THE LANDFILL DURING THE CLEANUP AT GROUND ZERO;----- A SEPARATE AREA AT THE LANDFILL WAS DEDICATED TO EVIDENCE FROM----- BUILDING SEVEN, WHICH HOUSED FBI FILES, WEAPONS, AND OTHER HIGHLY----- SENSITIVE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ITEMS.----------- JUST AS AT GROUND ZERO, EPA PROVIDED WASH STATIONS FOR-WORKERS----- AND VEHICLES, MONITORED AIR AND DUST FOR ASBESTOS AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS-----, AND REMOVED HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. AT THE LANDFILL EPA ALSO INSPECTED----- THE WASHING AND VACUUMING OF CARS CRUSHED IN THE COLLAPSE AND----- THE WASHING OF NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF SANITATION BARGES.----- MOST OF THE CARS WERE DECONTAMINATED AND EVENTUALLY SENT OFF-SITE----- FOR RECYCLING.----------- EPA ON-SCENE COORDINATORS INITIALLY SET UP 10 AIR SAMPLING LOCATIONS----- AT THE LANDFILL----- - EIGHT AROUND THE PERIMETER AND TWO WITHIN----- THE SIFTING AREAS. THEY LATER ADDED THREE OFF-SITE LOCATIONS TO----- MAKE SURE THE WINDS WEREN'T CARRYING CONTAMINANTS INTO THE SURROUNDING----- COMMUNITIES. DURING THE COURSE OF THE LANDFILL OPERATIONS, EPA----- TOOK MORE THAN 5,200 AIR SAMPLES, FINDING ASBESTOS ABOVE THE AHERA----- STANDARD IN LESS THAN 1 PERCENT OF THE SAMPLES.----------------- "WE NEVER HIT THE OSHA PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE LIMIT----------," DEANGELIS POINTS OUT, REFERRING TO THE FEDERAL STANDARD FOR ASBESTOS----- EXPOSURE UNDER OSHA (.1 FIBER PER CUBIC CENTIMETER AVERAGED OVER----- AN EIGHT-HOUR DAY), DESIGNED TO PROTECT WORKERS ON THE JOB. THE----- DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE AHERA AND OSHA STANDARDS CAUSED CONFUSION----- AMONG SOME WORKERS, ACCORDING TO DEANGELIS.----- "WHEN WE WOULD----- COME UP WITH A HIT ON (THE AHERA) STANDARD, BUT THE OSHA STANDARDS----- WASN'T COMING UP WITH A HIT BECAUSE IT WAS LESS THAN THEIR LEVEL----- OF CONCERN, IN THE WORKERS' MINDS SOMEBODY WAS LYING TO THEM.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" CONFORTINI TOOK CHARGE OF EPA'S EFFORT TO BUILD WASH STATIONS.----- THE STATIONS, WHICH WERE COMPLETED IN THE FIRST WEEK IN OCTOBER-----, PROCESSED ABOUT 2,000 PEOPLE A DAY AND REPLACED TEMPORARY WASHING----- FACILITIES PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL GUARD.----- "THERE WERE PEOPLE----- SITTING IN CARS WITH THEIR WORK GLOVES ON,-----" CONFORTINI RECALLS.---------- "THEY WERE SO FOCUSED ON EVIDENCE RETRIEVAL, AND RETRIEVAL----- OF REMAINS, THAT THEY WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY.----------------" AFTER THE WASH STATIONS WERE BUILT, CONFORTINI COMMUNICATED REGULARLY----- WITH MANAGERS OF EACH OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES INVOLVED----- IN THE SIFTING TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH THE SITE'S HEALTH AND----- SAFETY PROCEDURES. HE CREDITS THE NYPD LEADERSHIP FOR MUCH OF----- THE PERSONAL HYGIENE SUCCESS AT THE LANDFILL.----------------- "MY JOB IS NOT TO POLICE ALL THESE LAW ENFORCEMENT GUYS WHO----- HAVE GUNS AND BULLET-PROOF VESTS,-----" SAYS CONFORTINI.----- "I----- HAVEN'T GOT A GUN. MY JOB WAS TO GET THEIR MANAGEMENT TO DO IT.----- WHEN THE RANK AND FILE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZED----- AND MANDATED THE WASHING PROTOCOLS, IT MEANT SOMETHING, RATHER----- THAN SOME GUY FROM THE EPA.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" FRESH KILLS ALSO SERVED AS A STAGING GROUND FOR THE FINAL DISPOSAL----- OF THE 1.6 MILLION TONS OF DEBRIS FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.----- THANKS TO CONCERTED EFFORTS BY THE CITY AND EPA, MUCH OF THE DEBRIS----- WAS RECYCLED----- - INCLUDING HEAVY STEEL, LIGHT STEEL, COMPRESSED----- GAS CYLINDERS, CRUSHED CARS, BATTERIES, AND FLOURESCENT LIGHT----- BALLASTS. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS WERE SET ASIDE FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.---------------- "SOME OF THE RECYCLING,-----" DEANGELIS SAYS,----- "WAS DONE----- WITH THE EYE THAT WE DIDN'T WANT MATERIALS TO SHOW UP ON EBAY----- AS SOUVENIR ITEMS. WE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE, WHEN WE GOT CERTAIN----- ITEMS LIKE SCBA (SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS) BOTTLES-----, THAT THEY WERE CRUSHED AND CUT TO WHERE THEY COULDN'T BE SOLD----- THAT WAY, AND THEN EITHER RECYCLED OR DISPOSED OF.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" COMMUNICATING THE RESPONSE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EPA FACED A DAILY COMMUNICATIONS CHALLENGE: EXPLAINING THE MONITORING----- DATA IN A MEANINGFUL WAY TO NEWS REPORTERS, CITIZENS, COMMUNITY----- GROUPS, AND THE RESCUE AND RECOVERY WORKERS. WHILE THE DATA WAS----- CLEARLY SHOWING NO PATTERN OF EXTENDED EXPOSURE TO LONG-TERM HEALTH----- RISKS, INDIVIDUAL EXCEEDANCES SUCH AS THOSE FOR ASBESTOS AND PARTICULATE----- MATTER WERE CAUSE FOR CONCERN AMONG THE PRESS AND PUBLIC, ESPECIALLY----- WHEN LOCAL RESIDENTS AND-RESCUE WORKERS BEGAN-EXPERIENCING SHORT-TERM----- HEALTH EFFECTS, SUCH AS PERSISTENT COUGHS.---------------- "IN A TIME WHEN THE PUBLIC WANTED ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE----------," SAYS EPA SPOKESPERSON MARY MEARS,----- "NOT ONLY COULD EPA NOT----- GIVE IT TO THEM, BUT--- SCIENCE---- CAN'T GIVE THEM THAT KIND----- OF ASSURANCE.--------------------"  "PEOPLE WANTED TO SEE THE INFORMATION,-----" MUSZYNSKI SAYS.---------- "THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE DATA. THEY WANTED TO SEE WHAT----- IT REPRESENTED AND WHERE IT CAME FROM.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"  WITH ASSISTANCE FROM THE HEADQUARTERS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TEAM-----, EPA ESTABLISHED A COMPUTER DATABASE TIED TO THE AGENCY'S GEOGRAPHIC----- IMAGING SYSTEM (GIS) TO GATHER AND REPORT MONITORING RESULTS FOR----- ALL THE CONTAMINANTS BEING SAMPLED. DAILY MONITORING SUMMARIES----- WERE POSTED ON THE EPA WEB SITE AND MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PRESS----- THROUGHOUT THE RECOVERY OPERATIONS. EACH DAY, EPA BROUGHT THE----- FIRE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER RESPONDING AGENCIES ITS LATEST SAMPLING----- DATA ON VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS SO THAT RECOVERY WORKERS COULD----- TAKE APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS.---------------- "THE MONITORING SYSTEM WAS SOMETHING EPA CAN BE REALLY PROUD----- OF,-----" SAYS CALLAHAN, WHOM REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR JANE M. KENNY----- PLACED IN CHARGE OF THE RESPONSE'S DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. CALLAHAN----- WORKED ON THE MONITORING DATA SYSTEM WITH LAPOSTA AND EPA STAFFERS----- INCLUDING JOE COSENTINO, NICK MAGRIPLES, AND MARK GALLO, ALONG----- WITH CITY, STATE, AND FEDERAL AGENCIES.----- "IT WAS COLLABORATIVE----- AND FORTHRIGHT,-----" CALLAHAN SAYS.----- "EVERYONE JUST KEPT----- TALKING AND WORKING TOGETHER.----------------" IN ADDITION TO RESPONDING TO THE FLOOD OF PRESS INQUIRIES---------- - MEARS ESTIMATES THAT REGION 2 HANDLED UPWARDS OF 100 PRESS CALLS----- A DAY IN THE FIRST WEEK OF THE RESPONSE----- - EPA ALSO REPORTED----- ON ITS MONITORING RESULTS AT NUMEROUS PUBLIC MEETINGS AROUND THE----- CITY AND IN TESTIMONY BEFORE CITY, STATE, AND FEDERAL COMMITTEES.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A NEW PHASE BEGINS------------ AS RECOVERY EFFORTS AT GROUND ZERO AND FRESH KILLS LANDFILL CAME----- TO AN END, EPA HALTED ITS ACTIVITIES AT THESE SITES AS WELL. OUTDOOR----- ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING ENDED AT GROUND ZERO IN LATE MAY AND----- AT THE LANDFILL SEVERAL WEEKS LATER, AND THE WASH TENTS CAME DOWN----- SOON AFTERWARD.----------- EPA'S ROLE IN THE RESPONSE HAS NOW ENTERED A NEW PHASE: PROVIDING----- LOCAL RESIDENTS THE ASSURANCE THAT THEIR HOMES HAVE BEEN CLEANED----- PROPERLY.------------ IN THE FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS OF THE RESPONSE, EPA URGED PEOPLE----- WHO RETURNED TO DUSTY HOMES AND WORKPLACES TO HAVE THESE INDOOR----- SPACES PROFESSIONALLY CLEANED. WITH CONCERNS ABOUT INDOOR AIR----- QUALITY LINGERING INTO THE NEW YEAR, EPA ADMINISTRATOR WHITMAN----- ESTABLISHED THE TASK FORCE ON INDOOR AIR IN LOWER MANHATTAN TO----- ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN MAY, RESPONDING TO THE TASK FORCE'S RECOMMENDATIONS, REGIONAL----- ADMINISTRATOR KENNY ANNOUNCED A CLEANUP PLAN FOR RESIDENCES IN----- LOWER MANHATTAN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CITY, FEMA, OSHA, AND----- NEW YORK STATE. SHE SAID IN ANNOUNCING THE PROGRAM,----- "WHILE----- THE SCIENTIFIC DATA ABOUT ANY IMMEDIATE HEALTH RISKS FROM INDOOR----- AIR IS REASSURING, PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO LIVE WITH UNCERTAINTY----- ABOUT THEIR FUTURES.----------------" THE VOLUNTARY PROGRAM GIVES LOWER MANHATTAN RESIDENTS THE OPTION----- OF EITHER HAVING THEIR UNITS TESTED FOR ASBESTOS OR CLEANED AND----- THEN TESTED BY PROFESSIONAL CLEANERS ON CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT.----- RESIDENTS CAN ALSO REQUEST FREE HEPA VACUUM CLEANERS THROUGH THE----- PROGRAM.----------- DURING THE SUMMER, EPA TESTED VARIOUS CLEANUP TECHNIQUES IN A -----STILL-UNOCCUPIED BUILDING NEAR THE WORLD TRADE CENTER SITE. TESTING----- BEGAN ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF THE MORE THAN 800 UNITS AT WHICH----- RESIDENTS REQUESTED TESTING ONLY, AND EPA ANTICIPATES THAT CLEANING----- OF THE MORE THAN-3,000 UNITS REQUESTING CLEANING AND TESTING WILL----- BEGIN IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINAL IMPRESSIONS------------ ON THE DAY OF THE ATTACKS, ACTING REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR MUSZYNSKI----- WAS PREPARING FOR A 9 A.M. MEETING WITH OFFICIALS FROM PUERTO----- RICO ON DRINKING WATER ISSUES. FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, THAT MEETING----- NEVER HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER---- IT WAS FINALLY HELD IN THE SUMMER----- OF----- 2002 - A SIGN THAT LIFE AT EPA'S REGION 2 IS BEGINNING----- TO RETURN TO NORMAL.---------------- "EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT PROBABLY IS FOR----- US TO GET BACK TO DO THE USUAL THINGS,-----" MUSZYNSKI SAYS.----- "THE----- TRADE CENTERS ARE NO LONGER THERE, SO IT'S A CONSTANT REMINDER.----- SO AS-THE ADMINISTRATOR HAS SAID, WE WILL GO BACK TO DOING THE----- USUAL THINGS, WE JUST WON'T ALWAYS DO THEM AS WE USUALLY DID THEM.----------------" AS MANY REGION 2 STAFFERS LOOK BACK ON AN UNFORGETTABLE YEAR-----, THEY DO SO WITH PRIDE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "ARE THERE THINGS WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER ALONG THE WAY?----- YES, AS ANYONE WOULD EXPECT,-----" SAYS BARBARA FINAZZO, WHO WAS----- ACTING DEPUTY REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR LAST SEPTEMBER.----- "BUT----- I FIRMLY BELIEVE WE RESPONDED IN THE BEST WAY THAT WE KNEW HOW.----- I WILL ALWAYS STAND BY THE FACT THAT I'M VERY PROUD OF WHAT WE----- ALL DID.---------------------" "THERE WAS A LOT OF DEDICATION, A LOT OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION----- OF SCIENCE ISSUES, A LOT OF REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE BEYOND OUR----- AGENCY WHO COULD PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUES WE WERE----- DEALING WITH, AND A TIRELESS EFFORT,-----" SAYS LAPOSTA.---------------- "I'M PROUD OF THE FACT,-----" MEARS SAYS,----- "THAT A WHOLE----- GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM THIS AGENCY PULLED TOGETHER IN A HURRY DESPITE----- BEING TRAUMATIZED ON ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS AND TURNED OUR ATTENTION----- TO WHETHER THE PEOPLE IN AND AROUND LOWER MANHATTAN WERE SAFE.----- (AND) I'M REALLY PROUDEST OF THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WENT OUT----- THERE DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY, ON THAT PILE, TAKING SAMPLES, NOT----- BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR OWN HEALTH BUT BECAUSE THEY----- WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE WERE PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE----- OF NEW YORK.----------------" NORRELL MAY HAVE SUMMED IT UP BEST FOR HIS FELLOW OSCS---------- - AND, INDEED, ALL EPA STAFF INVOLVED----- - WHEN HE EXPLAINED THE----- PRIVILEGE HE FELT AT TAKING PART IN THE RESPONSE.----- "EVERYBODY----- IN THE WORLD WANTED TO DO SOMETHING, AND I WAS GETTING THE CHANCE----- TO DO SOMETHING.----------------------------------------------" TRUE TO ITS MISSION TO SAFEGUARD PUBLIC HEALTH AND PROTECT THE----- ENVIRONMENT, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) HAS----- BEEN PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN THE NATION'S RESPONSE TO THE SEPTEMBER----- 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE-WORLD TRADE CENTER. WITH MUCH----- HELP FROM EPA HEADQUARTERS AND OTHER REGIONS, MORE THAN 200 EMPLOYEES----- FROM EPA'S REGION 2 OFFICES IN LOWER MANHATTAN AND EDISON, NEW----- JERSEY, HAVE ENGAGED IN THE RESPONSE AT GROUND ZERO AND THE STATEN----- ISLAND LANDFILL WHERE DEBRIS WAS BROUGHT FOR EVIDENCE-GATHERING.----- THEIR MAJOR ACTIVITIES HAVE INCLUDED:--------------- O- MONITORING AIR, WATER, AND DUST FOR POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL----- HAZARDS------------ O- VACUUMING DUST AND DEBRIS FROM STREETS AND OTHER OUTDOOR----- SPACES IN LOWER MANHATTAN------------ O- REMOVING AND DISPOSING OF HAZARDOUS WASTES FROM THE SITES O------------------- CREATING AN ONLINE DATABASE TO REPORT MONITORING RESULTS----- TO THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC------------ O- SETTING UP WASH STATIONS AND PROVIDING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT----- FOR RECOVERY WORKERS------------ O- DEVELOPING A CLEANING AND TESTING PROGRAM FOR INDOOR RESIDENCES----- IN LOWER MANHATTAN---------------  "WE WERE JUST DOING OUR PART,-----" SAYS DEPUTY REGIONAL----- ADMINISTRATOR MUSZYNSKI.----- "WE WERE DOING OUR PART, JUST AS----- THE RED CROSS WAS DOING ITS PART, THE WAY SO MANY SUPPORT GROUPS----- WERE, THE WAY THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS WAS DOING ITS PART, THE WAY----- TRUCK DRIVERS WERE MOVING MATERIAL OUT AND DOING THEIR PART.---------------------" "BEYOND THE SCIENCE AND THE REGULATION, BEYOND THE STANDARDS----- AND THE BENCHMARKS, EPA IS AT HEART ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE----------," SAYS REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR KENNY.----- "OUR EMPLOYEES PROVED----- THAT EVERY DAY OF THIS RESPONSE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
