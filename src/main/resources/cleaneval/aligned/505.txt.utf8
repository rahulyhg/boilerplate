(1918)--- GIRLS' CLUBS. THEIR ORGANIZATION AND--------------- MANAGEMENT. A MANUAL FOR WORKERS----, NEW YORK: E. P. DUTTON AND--------------- COMPANY.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NEED FOR A LEADER--------------------------------------------------------- [PAGE--------------------------- 14] THE NECESSITY FOR HAVING A LEADER AMONG ANY GROUP OF ORGANIZED GIRLS IS--------- EVIDENT TO ALL WHO HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH GIRLS- CLUBS. THE YOUNGER--------- THE-------------------- GIRLS, THE GREATER BECOMES------- THIS NECESSITY--------- FOR THE PRESENCE OF AN OLDER PERSON WHO CAN STEADY THEIR IMPETUOUS--------- ENTHUSIASM AND TACTFULLY GUIDE THEIR ACTIVITIES INTO USEFUL CHANNELS. NO--------- MATTER WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE CLUB IS, THE GIRLS ARE COMING TOGETHER--------- BECAUSE OF SOME NEED IN THEIR LIVES. THIS NEED MAY BE SOCIAL OR--------- EDUCATIONAL IN CHARACTER. BUT, WHATEVER IT IS, A CLUB LEADER WHO IS--------- FAR-SEEING, WISE IN HER JUDGMENTS, AND SYMPATHETIC, CAN INTRODUCE INTO--------- THE CLUB ACTIVITIES THE ELEMENTS WHICH WILL MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CLUB--------- MEMBERS. OFTEN THE GIRLS BUT VAGUELY REALIZE THAT THERE IS A LACK, IN--------- THEIR LIVES. IT IS PART OF THE OLDER CUB LEADER-S TASK TO DISCOVER IT--------- AND TO MEET IT.--------------------------------- THE PRESENCE OF A CLUB LEADER GIVES TO THE--------- PROCEEDINGS OF THE CLUB A STABILITY WHICH IS MOST NECESSARY. THE MOTHERS--------- OF THE GIRLS ARE MORE WILLING TO HAVE THEIR DAUGHTERS ATTEND THE CLUB--------- MEETINGS WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THE CLUB IS UNDER WISE SUPERVISION. IF THE--------- CLUB LEADER IS PRESENT AT EVERY MEETING, ON HAND EARLY TO WELCOME ALL--------- COMERS, IF SHE KNOWS WHAT MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED AND--- [PAGE---- 15] BY--------- HER SUGGESTIONS SEES THAT THE CLUB DOES NOT WANDER FROM ITS PURPOSE----------- SHE CONSTITUTES A HELP TO ANY CLUB WHICH IT CANNOT AFFORD TO BE WITHOUT.--------------------------------- WHEN TIMES OF STRESS AND DISAGREEMENT ENTER INTO--------- THE CLUB LIFE, THE CLUB MEMBERS OFTEN LOOK INSTINCTIVELY TO A FAIR AND--------- IMPARTIAL CLUB LEADER TO MAKE THE NECESSARY DECISION AND TO BRING--------- HARMONY TO THE RANKS ONCE MORE. A WISE AND TACTFUL LEADER CAN FREQUENTLY--------- HOLD A CLUB TOGETHER WHEN, WITHOUT HER, THE CLUB MIGHT HAVE SUDDENLY--------- ENDED ITS EXISTENCE.--------------------------------- THE PRESENCE OF A LEADER IS OFTEN NECESSARY FOR THE--------- CONSTRUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLUB. MANY GROUPS OF GIRLS HAVE BUT FEW--------- IDEAS FOR THE ACTIVITIES UPON WHICH THEIR CLUBS SHOULD ENTER. GIVEN A--------- GOOD SUGGESTION FROM THEIR LEADER, HOWEVER, THEY ARE ABLE TO ENLARGE--------- UPON IT-AND ADD THEIR OWN IDEAS. OTHER GIRLS HAVE SUGGESTIONS WHICH ARE--------- PRACTICABLE FOR CLUB WORK ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN ADAPTED TO THE--------- PARTICULAR SITUATION AT HAND. A FARSEEING CLUB LEADER RECEIVES SUCH--------- SUGGESTIONS AND TACTFULLY MODIFIES THEM FOR HER PARTICULAR CLUB. SUCH--------- FUNCTIONS OF A CLUB LEADER COULD-SCARCELY BE PERFORMED BY ONE OF THE--------- GIRLS THEMSELVES, FOR IT IS THE MORE MATURE JUDGMENT OF THE LEADER WHICH--------- ENABLES HER TO MEET AND TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF CLUB LIFE.--------------------------------- TO THE UNINITIATED, IT MIGHT-SEEM A WISE POLICY TO--------- ALLOW ONE OF THE CLUB MEMBERS TO ASSUME THESE DUTIES OF LEADER. SUCH A--------- COURSE OF ACTION SUGGESTS GREATER OPPORTUNITY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF--------- SELF-RELIANCE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IN MOST GIRLS- CLUBS THE PRESENCE OF--------- A LEADER IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO INSURE JUST THIS TRAINING-TO ALL CLUB--------- MEMBERS ALIKE. A CLUB OF YOUNG GIRLS WITHOUT A LEADER-- A LEADER WHO--------- INSISTS THAT ALL HER GIRLS, WHETHER--- [PAGE---- 16] SELF-ASSERTIVE OR--------- RETIRING, SHARE EQUALLY IN THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE CLUB-- WILL ALMOST--------- INEVITABLY SEE ITS AFFAIR, GRADUALLY DRIFT INTO THE CONTROL OF A FEW--------- NATURAL- LEADERS-, AND ITS SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY LOSE FORCE. A CLUB LEADER----------IS NEEDED AMONG GIRLS TO SEE THAT THE--------------------- HONORS---------------- AND OPPORTUNITIES OF CLUB LIFE ARE DISTRIBUTED- SHARE AND- SHARE ALIKE.---------- HER PRESENCE SHOULD MEAN GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR HER GIRLS AND---------, BECAUSE SHE-IS THERE, HER CLUB SHOULD BE A MORE HELPFUL AND HAPPY ONE.---------------------------------- WHO IS TO BE LEADER?---------------------------------- THIS IS THE QUESTION WHICH CONFRONTS MANY A CLUB--------- ORGANIZER AS SHE-THINKS OF A GROUP OF-GIRLS WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO-SEE--------- FORMED IN A CLUB.-------------------- FOR THE MAJORITY OF GIRLS- CLUBS--------- ARE FORMED AT THE INSTIGATION OF SOME LARGER-ORGANIZATION OR BECAUSE OF--------- THE INTEREST OF SOME SOCIAL-WORKER OR OTHER BROAD-MINDED PERSON.---------------- THE HEAD OF A SETTLEMENT HOUSE GETS ACQUAINTED WITH A FEW GIRLS WHO ARE--------- INTERESTED IN SEWING SHE THINKS IT WILL BE HELPFUL TO HAVE THEM MEET--------- TOGETHER-AND THUS IS BORN A SEWING CLUB. AN EXTENSION LIBRARY WORKER--------- FINDS SOME GIRLS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN READING. SHE SENDS OUT--------- INVITATIONS FOR A- BOOK PARTY-, AT THE CLOSE OF WHICH SHE SUGGESTS THAT--------- THEY MEET REGULARLY TO READ AND DISCUSS WHAT THEY HAVE READ. THE IDEA IS--------- ENTHUSIASTICALLY RECEIVED AND A GIRLS- CLUB IS THEN UNDER WAY. OR--------- PERHAPS A Y W C-------------------- A------- SECRETARY FINDS A FACTORY--------- WHERE THE LUNCH HOUR IS SUFFICIENTLY LONG FOR-SOME ACTIVITY. SHE OBTAINS--------- PERMISSION TO TRY OUT HER PLAN AND GOES TO THE FACTORY DURING THE LUNCH--------- HOUR. THE GIRLS GATHER AROUND HER. SHE TELLS STORIES OR AMUSES THEM--------- 4.VITH- STUNTS.- THE GIRLS SHOW--- [PAGE---- 17] THEIR INTEREST AND SHE--------- ASKS THEM WHETHER THEY WOULDN-T ENJOY COMING TOGETHER ONCE A WEEK. THEY--------- AGREE TO DO SO-- AND ANOTHER GIRLS- CLUB HAS BEEN ORGANIZED. TO BE SURE---------, GROUPS OF GIRLS DO ORGANIZE INTO CLUBS WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE SUGGESTION.--------- SUCH GROUPS SOMETIMES APPLY FOR ADMISSION INTO A SETTLEMENT HOUSE--------- ORGANIZATION. THEY HAVE BEEN TOGETHER IN SCHOOL AND NOW THEY WISH TO--------- HAVE A CLUB. IN ANY CASE, THE GROUP OF GIRLS IS THERE. THEY CAN BE--------- ORGANIZED. NOW WHAT ABOUT A LEADER?--------------------------------- THE OBVIOUS ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION SEEMS TO BE-, A--------- WOMAN.- AND THIS ANSWER COMES NATURALLY BECAUSE WOMEN HAVE SUCCESSFULLY--------- HELD THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MAJORITY OF GIRLS- CLUBS. MEN HAVE, AT TIMES---------, WISELY DIRECTED SUCH ORGANIZATIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CLUB HAS MET FOR--------- SOME CLASS WORK AND THE MAN IN CHARGE HAS BEEN QUALIFIED TO TEACH IN--------- THAT DEFINITE WORK. BUT A WOMAN SEEMS ESPECIALLY FITTED FOR CLUB--------- LEADERSHIP BECAUSE OF HER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH THE GIRL--------- CONSTANTLY MEETS. THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS- MANUAL OUTLINES THE--------- QUALIFICATIONS OF A- GUARDIAN- (AS THE CAMP FIRE LEADERS ARE CALLED) IN--------- THE FOLLOWING WAY:- CAMP FIRE GUARDIANS ARE OLDER WOMEN, WHO, BECAUSE OF--------- THEIR LARGER EXPERIENCES, ARE ABLE TO LEAD THE GIRLS INTO LARGER--------- INTERESTS. MOTHERS ARE URGED TO BECOME GUARDIANS, AND THE MEETINGS ARE--------- USUALLY HELD IN THE HOMES OR OUT-OF-DOORS.--------------------- IF---------, THEN, A WOMAN IS TO BE CHOSEN AS LEADER OF A PROPOSED GIRLS- CLUB, WHAT--------- KIND OF WOMAN IS BEST QUALIFIED FOR THE TASK?------- SHALL THE ORGANIZER--------- SEARCH FOR A YOUNG WOMAN, FULL OF ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY, OR FOR AN OLDER--------- WOMAN, WITH THE WISDOM OF JUDGMENT THAT COMES WITH YEARS? THERE CAN BE--------- NO FIXED RULE TO FOLLOW. GIRLS- CLUBS HAVE SUCCEEDED UNDER THE GUIDANCE--------- OF--- [PAGE---- 18] ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNG WOMEN, FULL OF THE- STUNTS- WHICH--------- GIRLS ENJOY. AND THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL UNDER OLDER WOMEN WHO HAVE--------- HAD THE SPIRIT OF YOUTH IN THEIR HEARTS. THE KIND OF LEADER DESIRED--------- DEPENDS UPON THE SITUATION AT HAND. THE SOCIAL WORKER HUNTS FOR A--------- VOLUNTEER WORKER. THE EMPLOYER SEARCHES FOR SOMEONE TO EMPLOY. IN EITHER--------- CASE, THE TASK IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME. THE SOCIAL WORKER MUST FIND--------- SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO TAKE UP THE TASK AND WHO WILL BE FAITHFUL TO--------- HER RESPONSIBILITIES. THE EMPLOYER MUST FIND A CLUB WORKER WHO IS--------- PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GIRLS,-RATHER THAN IN THE--------- SALARY HE WILL PAY HER FOR THE WORK.--------------------------------- EACH CLUB PRESENTS ITS SPECIAL PROBLEMS AND OFTEN--------- THE LEADER SHOULD BE DEFINITELY QUALIFIED TO MEET THOSE PROBLEMS. THE--------- LEADER OF A GIRLS- CANNING CLUB IN THE-COUNTRY MUST UNDERSTAND THE ART--------- OF CANNING AND PRESERVING. SHE WILL, WHENEVER POSSIBLE, INTRODUCE INTO--------- THE CLUB LIFE THOSE SOCIAL ELEMENTS WHICH MEAN SO MUCH TO THE LONELY--------- COUNTRY GIRL; BUT, FIRST AND FOREMOST, THE CLUB HAS BEEN ORGANIZED TO--------- CAN. AND THE LEADER MUST THEREFORE HAVE THIS SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE. THE--------- LEADER OF A LITERARY CLUB WILL OF NECESSITY HAVE-------------------- A--------- KNOWLEDGE------- OF BOOKS. HER GIRLS HAVE FORMED A LITERARY CLUB BECAUSE--------- OF THEIR INTEREST IN LITERATURE. HER OWN ACQUAINTANCE WITH BOOKS WILL--------- ENABLE HER TO SUGGEST THOSE BOOKS FOR STUDY WHICH WILL BE DEFINITELY--------- HELPFUL AND INSPIRING TO HER PARTICULAR GROUP OF GIRLS. THE LEADER OF A--------- GIRLS- CLUB IN A BUSINESS HOUSE WILL GRASP THE VARIOUS PHASES OF THE--------- BUSINESS LIFE IN WHICH THE CLUB IS TO GROW, AND WILL PLAN HER WORK TO--------- APPEAL TO AND HELP GIRLS WHO ARE IN JUST THAT SITUATION. THE LEADER OF A--------- GROUP OF FOREIGN GIRLS WILL FIND IT HELPFUL IF SHE IS ABLE TO SPEAK--------- THEIR--- [PAGE---- 19] NATIVE LANGUAGE. THIS ABILITY OF HERS IS THE DOOR--------- THROUGH WHICH SHE CAN LEAD THEM TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF AMERICAN LIFE AND--------- ITS IDEALS.--------------------------------- NOT EVERY CLUB REQUIRES SUCH SPECIFIC TALENTS. MOST--------- GIRLS- CLUBS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AMONG THE YOUNGER GIRLS, COME TOGETHER TO---------- HAVE A CLUB.- THEY WISH TO DO MANY KINDS OF THINGS IN THEIR HOURS--------- TOGETHER-SINGING PLAYING, DANCING AND WHATEVER ELSE APPEALS TO THEM. IN--------- THE MAJORITY OF CLUBS, IN SETTLEMENT HOUSES, IN------------------------------ Y.W.C.A.-S------- AND IN CHURCHES, THE DEMAND IS FOR A GENERAL CLUB--------- LEADER, ONE WHO CAN RALLY THE GIRLS, INTEREST THEM IN THE ACTIVITIES OF--------- THE CLUB AND CARRY THOSE ACTIVITIES TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION. IT IS--------- ALWAYS OF GREAT HELP, HOWEVER, IN PLANNING THE WORK OF ANY CLUB, TO KNOW--------- AT THE OUTSET WHAT THE PROSPECTIVE LEADER IS ABLE TO DO IN ANY SPECIAL--------- LINE. THE SETTLEMENT OR GUILD DIRECTOR CAN THEN OFTEN SUGGEST CERTAIN--------- ACTIVITIES WHEN SHE KNOWS THAT THE LEADER IS QUALIFIED TO CARRY THEM ON.--------- THE CLUB LEADER HERSELF DOES NOT ALWAYS REALIZE THAT HER TALENTS CAN BE--------- OF PRACTICAL USE, UNTIL THE QUESTIONING OF THE ORGANIZER BRINGS THE--------- MATTER TO HER ATTENTION AND POINTS OUT THE POSSIBILITIES. THIS SEARCH--------- FOR SOME TALENTS OFTEN REVEALS OTHERS WHICH ARE EQUALLY USEFUL, AND THE--------- CLUB LEADER COMES TO REALIZE THIS IMPORTANT FACT-THAT GIRLS- CLUB WORK--------- IS WIDE IN ITS POSSIBILITIES AND ITS REQUIREMENTS, AND THAT-WHATEVER SHE--------- HERSELF CAN DO WELL-THIS VERY TRAINING CAN BE PASSED ON TO HER GIRLS.---------------------------------------- SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS TO BE SOUGHT---------------------------------- THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS SHOW THE POINTS CONCERNING--------- PROSPECTIVE CLUB LEADERS WHICH AN ORGANIZER OF GIRLS HAS CONSIDERED--------- IMPORTANT IN HER OWN SELECTION OF THEM.-------------------------------------------------------- [PAGE---------------------------------- 20] CHOOSING THE CLUB LEADER--------------------------------------------------------- HER APPEARANCE AND--------- PERSONALITY----.------- IS SHE NEAT AND ATTRACTIVE APPEARANCE? IS HER--------- PERSONALITY, WINNING?---------------- HER TRAINING--------------------------------------------------------- EDUCATION----.------- WHAT--------- HAS BEEN HER EDUCATION? IF AT A COLLEGE OR OTHER ADVANCED SCHOOL, IN.--------- WHAT DID- SHE SPECIALIZE? WHAT DID SHE MOST ENJOY? WAS .SHE ACTIVE IN--------- ANY NON-ACADEMIC INTERESTS? IF SO, WHICH WERE THEY? DID SHE HOLD ANY--------- OFFICES OR SERVE ON ANY COMMITTEES?-------------------------------------------------------- SPECIAL TALENTS----.---------------- HAS SHE ANY SPECIAL TALENTS? IS SHE MUSICAL? CAN SHE COACH PLAYS? CAN--------- SHE DIRECT ATHLETICS? TEACH DANCING? CAN SHE TEACH COOKING? CAN SHE--------- TEACH SEWING? ART EMBROIDERY? CROCHET OR KNITTING? CAN SHE TEACH ANY--------- SPECIAL ARTS, SUCH AS WEAVING? DOES SHE ENJOY BOOKS AND READING?-------------------------------------------------------- PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE----.---------------- HAS SHE HELD ANY POSITION, VOLUNTEER OR PAID, PREVIOUSLY TO THIS?---------------------------- IF SO, WHAT?--------------------------- FOR HOW--------- LONG?------- WHY DID SHE LEAVE? HAS SHE EVER DONE WORK OF THIS KIND--------- BEFORE?--------------------- WHERE?------- WHAT WAS THE EXTENT OF IT?--------- WHO WERE THE GIRLS WITH WHOM SHE DEALT? WHAT WERE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE--------- CLUB? DID SHE ENJOY IT? IF SHE HAS NEVER BEEN ACTIVE IN CLUB WORK--------- BEFORE, BOW DID SHE-------------------- BECOME------- INTERESTED IN IT?--------- HOW MUCH TIME CAN SHE GIVE TO IT? WHAT ARE HER IDEAS ABOUT THE--------- CONDUCTING OF A CLUB?------------------------------------ WHERE ARE LEADERS FOUND?---------------------------------- THE HEADS OF OUR LARGE SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS--------- NATURALLY LOOK TO OUR EDUCATED YOUNG WOMEN FOR SERVICE AS CLUB LEADERS.--------- THEY HAVE ENJOYED ADVANTAGES FOR WHICH MANY OF THESE CLUB GIRLS YEARN---------, OR, PERHAPS, TO WHICH THEY ARE LOOKING FORWARD. TO THOSE WHO WILL NEVER--------- BE ABLE TO ENJOY THEM, THE COLLEGE OR SCHOOL GIRL CAN BRING SOMETHING OF--------- THE HAPPINESS AND OF THE LESSONS OF SCHOOL DAYS. TO THOSE WHO WILL SOME--------- DAY BE COLLEGE GIRLS THEMSELVES, THE CLUB LEADER CAN BRING-THROUGH--------- THEIR- CLUB TEAM--- [PAGE---- 21] WORK-SOME ELEMENTS OF PREPARATION--------- WHICH ARE NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE PAGES OF THE LATIN GRAMMAR. IN HULL--------- HOUSE, THE EVENING SOCIAL CLUBS (SELF-GOVERNING GROUPS OF YOUNG PEOPLE---------) ORGANIZE AND MEET UNDER THE DIRECTION OF LEADERS APPOINTED BY THE SOCIAL--------- CLUBS COMMITTEE. THESE LEADERS ARE DRAWN FROM THE RECREATION DEPARTMENT--------- OF THE CHICAGO SCHOOL OF CIVICS AND. PHILANTHROPY AND ARE---------------------------- STUDENTS------- IN. TRAINING. SUCH A PLAN IS OF--------- GREAT ADVANTAGE BOTH TO THE CLUBS AND TO THE LEADERS. THE CLUBS ENJOY--------- THE LEADERSHIP OF TRAINED AND VITALLY INTERESTED WORKERS, AND THE--------- LEADERS ENJOY THE OPPORTUNITY OF CONTACT WITH A CLUB, WHILE THEY ARE--------- STUDYING TO BE RECREATIONAL DIRECTORS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GENERAL QUALIFICATIONS---------------------------------- BUT SUCH SPECIALLY TRAINED YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT--------- ALWAYS AVAILABLE. MANY OF OUR SMALLER AND COUNTRY COMMUNITIES HAVE NO--------- SPECIALLY EDUCATED WOMEN UPON WHOM THEY MAY CALL FOR CLUB LEADERSHIP.--------- THIS SHOULD NOT MEAN THAT A CLUB CANNOT BE STARTED IN THESE PLACES.--------- THERE CAN ALWAYS BE FOUND A CLUB LEADER FOR THE GIRLS, IF CAREFUL SEARCH--------- IS MADE. MANY A MOTHER HAS BEEN FOUND WHO HAS WELCOMED SUCH AN--------- OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH HER DAUGHTER AND HER DAUGHTER-S FRIENDS AND TO--------- BE- CHUMS- WITH THEM. OFTEN SCHOOL TEACHERS HAVE BEEN PERSUADED TO--------- UNDERTAKE THE WORK; THEY HAVE BEEN GLAD TO MEET THE GIRLS IN AN INFORMAL--------- WAY AND TO PUT ASIDE THE RELATIONSHIP OF BEING THE- TEACHER.- THE CAMP--------- FIRE MANUAL SUGGESTS THESE POINTS IN THE SELECTION OF A LEADER.---------- GUARDIANS SHOULD BE APPOINTED FROM AMONG THOSE (1) WHO PERSONALLY KNOW--------- THE FAMILIES OF THE GIRLS; (2) WITH WHOM THE PARENTS WILL COOPERATE.- IF--------- A WOMAN--- [PAGE---- 21] IS VITALLY INTERESTED IN THE GIRLS, OPEN TO--------- SUGGESTIONS, AND EAGER TO DEVELOP HER CLUB, THAT CLUB LEADER WILL RENDER--------- A SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY THROUGH THE ORGANIZATION WHICH SHE IS--------- HELPING.---------------------------------------- A FUNDAMENTAL REQUISITE---------------------------------- CLUB LEADERS OF MANY YEARS- EXPERIENCE OFTEN--------- REALIZE THAT, WHILE THE QUESTION OF ONE-S TALENTS AND SPECIFIC ABILITIES--------- IS APT TO BE A FIRST CONSIDERATION, IT IS, IN FACT, SECONDARY TO--------- ANOTHER. WITHOUT THIS OTHER, THE MOST BRILLIANTLY TALENTED CLUB LEADERS--------- HAVE FAILED IN THEIR EFFORTS. WITH IT, THOSE COMING TO THEIR CLUBS WITH--------- APPARENTLY EMPTY HANDS HAVE MADE OF THEIR CLUBS VITAL ORGANIZATIONS.--------- THIS PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IS THE SPIRIT OF THE LEADER. TO HAVE THE CLUB--------- DO ITS MOST EFFECTIVE WORK, THE LEADER MUST BE WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTERESTED--------- IN ITS MEMBERS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT. REAL INTEREST IN THE GIRLS MEANS--------- INTEREST NOT MERELY IN THEIR MEETINGS OF ONE OR TWO HOURS A WEEK OR A--------- MONTH. THE INFLUENCE OF THE BEST CLUB LEADER EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THESE--------- COMPARATIVELY SHORT PERIODS OF THEIR BEING TOGETHER IN THE CLUB, OUT--------- INTO THE LIVES, OF THE GIRLS, WHETHER AT HOME, AT WORK, OR IN SCHOOL.--------- SHE GETS INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THEM AND KNOWS THEIR FAMILY LIFE---------, THEIR PROBLEMS, AND THEIR INTERESTS. NO MATTER WHO OR WHERE THE GIRL IS---------, OF WHAT AGE OR NATIONALITY, SHE WILL RESPOND TO REAL INTEREST AND WILL--------- INSTINCTIVELY GO FOR ADVICE TO HER WHO SHE, FEELS IS HER REAL FRIEND.---------------------------------- DO NOT GO TO YOUR GIRLS WITH ANY FEELING OF--------- SUPERIORITY-, A SUCCESSFUL CLUB WORKER ONCE SAID TO A NEW CLUB LEADER----------, AND DON-T FEEL RATHER SATISFIED TO THINK YOU ARE DOING A TRULY GOOD--------- DEED. THEY WILL FEEL YOUR SUPERIORITY--- [PAGE---- 23] AND WILL RESENT--------- IT. INSTEAD, GO TO THEM AS YOU WOULD TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHOM YOU HAVE--------- WISHED FOR A LONG TIME TO MEET, AND AS FRIEND TO FRIEND GET ACQUAINTED.---------- THIS KEY WORD- AS FRIEND TO FRIEND- IS ONE WHICH THE NEW CLUB LEADER MAY--------- WELL- REMEMBER THROUGHOUT HER CLUB WORK.--------------------------------- A SMALL, UNATTRACTIVE WOMAN ONCE APPROACHED A--------- SUPERINTENDENT IN A CITY SUNDAY-------------------- SCHOOL------- AND--------- ASKED WHETHER SHE MIGHT TAKE A CLASS OF YOUNG WOMEN. THINKING HER--------- SERVICES WOULD BE OF NO SPECIAL VALUE, HE GAVE HER A CLASS OF THREE. IN--------- THE COURSE OF A YEAR, THE CLASS HAD GROWN TO SEVEN. TWO YEARS PASSED AND--------- FOURTEEN WERE IN THE CLASS. THE QUIET WOMAN HAD FORMED A GIRLS- CLUB--------- WHICH MET REGULARLY AT HER HOUSE. SHE HAD CALLED IN THE HOMES OF THE--------- GIRLS AND HAD COME TO KNOW THEIR FAMILIES. SHE REMEMBERED THEIR--------- BIRTHDAYS WITH CARDS AND WENT TO SEE THEM WHEN THEY WERE SICK. SHE GAVE--------- PARTIES FOR THEM TO WHICH THEY WERE SOMETIMES INVITED TO BRING YOUNG--------- MEN. SHE COULD NOT DIRECT PLAYS OR GET UP A GLEE CLUB, AND YET WHEN HER--------- GIRLS WISHED TO DO THOSE THINGS, THEY HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING--------- SOMEONE WHO WAS WILLING TO HELP THEM IN THAT SPECIAL LINE. SUCH--------- INSTANCES AS THIS ENCOURAGE TENTATIVE CLUB LEADERS WHO PERHAPS FEEL THAT--------- THEY HAVE-NOT SUFFICIENT ABILITY FOR CLUB WORK. A TRUE, WHOLESOME FRIEND--------- IS WHAT EVERY GIRL NEEDS AND IT IS POSSIBLE FOR AN EARNEST, INTERESTED--------- WORKER TO GIVE AND TO WIN FRIENDSHIP OF THIS KIND.---------------------------------------- OTHER DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS---------------------------------- TO NAME ALL THE PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS DESIRABLE--------- IN A CLUB LEADER WOULD BE TO DESCRIBE A COMBINATION OF--- [PAGE------------- 24] THEM WHICH IS RARELY, IF EVER, FOUND IN ONE WORKER. A FEW, HOWEVER---------, STAND OUT AS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL IN CLUB WORK AND SURELY NOT--------- UNATTAINABLE.------------------------------------ FAITHFULNESS-----HOW OFTEN HAS THE LACK OF IT ON--------- THE PART OF HER VOLUNTEER WORKERS BROUGHT DESPAIR TO THE HEART OF A--------- Y.W.C.A. DIRECTOR! AND, ON THE CONTRARY, HOW OFTEN HAS SHE BLESSED THE--------- CLUB LEADER WHO IS ALWAYS PRESENT AT MEETINGS, ALWAYS ON TIME, AND WHO--------- HAS ALWAYS MADE THE PLANS FOR WHICH SHE SAID SHE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE---------! THE BEST CLUB LEADER PLACES FAITHFULNESS TO HER WORD BEFORE HER OWN--------- PERSONAL PLEASURE, AND HER INFLUENCE UPON THE GIRLS IS STRONG OR WEAK--------- ACCORDING AS SHE CONSIDERS HER CLUB IMPORTANT OR UNIMPORTANT. ONE CLUB--------- LEADER ONCE WROTE A PLEDGE WHICH, IN HER OPINION, WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT--------- FOR A WORKER AMONG GIRLS TO OBSERVE. THE PLEDGE WAS AS FOLLOWS:- I WILL--------- ALWAYS KEEP MY PROMISES TO MY GIRLS, UNLESS SOME REAL REASON PREVENTS.--------- BY REAL REASON, I DO NOT MEAN AN ATTRACTIVE SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT.------------------------------------- ABILITY TO BE FAIR AND TO TREAT ALL CLUB MEMBERS--------- IMPARTIALLY---- IS ALSO DESIRABLE IN A CLUB LEADER. IT IS DIFFICULT TO--------- BE CONSTANTLY IMPARTIAL WHEN SOME OF THE GIRLS SEEM SO RESPONSIVE AND SO--------- WELL WORTH THE EFFORT EXPENDED UPON THEM, WHILE OTHERS ARE FAR FROM--------- BEING ATTRACTIVE AND ARE COLDLY INDIFFERENT. UNLESS A CLUB LEADER IS ON--------- HER GUARD, SHE WILL QUITE NATURALLY FALL INTO THE HABIT OF REFERRING TO--------- ONE OR TWO CLUB GIRLS AS IDEAL CLUB MEMBERS, AND BEFORE SHE KNOWS IT---------, THE REST OF THE CLUB WILL CHARGE HER WITH HAVING- PETS.- THOSE WHO HAVE--------- HAD LITTLE INTEREST BEFORE WILL SEIZE UPON THIS AS AN EXCUSE FOR THEIR--------- INDIFFERENCE. ONE CLUB LEADER FOUND HER WORK MADE SUDDENLY DIFFICULT--------- BECAUSE SHE HAD HELD UP A CERTAIN FEW GIRLS AS--- [PAGE---- 25] A--------- CONSTANT EXAMPLE BEFORE THE OTHERS. THIS AROUSED RESENTMENT IN THE CLUB--------- AGAINST THE GOOD WORKERS AND AGAINST HER. SHE HAD, TO BE SURE,----------------------------- HONORED------- THOSE WHO MOST DESERVED IT, BUT SHE--------- AFTERWARD SAID THAT HAD SHE REALIZED THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER ACTION, SHE--------- WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO- EMPHATIC ABOUT THE EXCELLENCE OF THE FEW AND--------- WOULD HAVE WORKED MORE INTENSIVELY WITH THE OTHERS TO BRING THEM UP TO--------- THE HIGH STANDARD.--------------------------------- THE NECESSITY FOR MAINTAINING WHOLESOME FRIENDSHIPS--------- IS CLOSELY ALLIED TO THIS ABILITY TO TREAT ALL WITH IMPARTIALITY. ANY--------- WHO HAVE DEALT WITH GIRLS KNOW WHAT A- CRUSH-, OR PASSIONATE--------- HERO-WORSHIP, IS; AND HAVE COME TO DREAD ITS APPEARANCE AS DESTRUCTIVE--------- TO TEAM WORK AND CLUB COOPERATION. INCIPIENT HERO-WORSHIP IS BUT NATURAL--------- IN GIRLS. THEY ARE AT THE HERO-WORSHIPING AGE. THE WISE CLUB LEADER WILL--------- NOT SHUN NOR TREAT WITH DISDAIN THE YOUNG- GIRL WHO DOGS HER FOOTSTEPS.--------- RATHER, SHE WILL MAKE OF IT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DEVELOPING A REAL AND--------- VITAL FRIENDSHIP. AND BY SHOWING AN ATTITUDE OF SIMPLE CORDIALITY AND--------- DISPASSIONATE INTEREST, SHE WILL ALMOST INVARIABLY BE ABLE TO WIN A--------- STEADY LOYALTY QUITE DIFFERENT FROM FLAMING AND FLUCTUATING ADORATION---------, AND FAR MORE LASTING. A DIRECTOR OF MANY GIRLS- CLUBS ONCE POINTED WITH--------- PRIDE TO THE FACT THAT THIS SPIRIT OF PASSION WAS LACKING IN ALL OF HER--------- ORGANIZATION.- SOME PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY--------- ON GIRLS- CLUB WORK WITHOUT IT-, SHE REMARKED-, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE AND--------- WE KNOW IT BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE IT. TO BE SURE, WE HAVE HAD A POLICY OF--------- AIMING AT WHOLESOME FRIENDSHIPS AND HAVE KEPT IT CONSTANTLY BEFORE US.--------- MORE THAN THIS, WE HAVE--------------------- ENDEAVORED------- TO HAVE--------- OUR OWN FRIENDSHIPS FOR EACH--- [PAGE---- 26] OTHER ON THE HIGH PLANE OF--------- BALANCE AND SANITY. ALL OF THIS HAS HELPED AND WE ARE PROUD OF THE--------- RESULT.------------------------------------- POWER TO SEE THINGS IN THE SAME WAY AS HER GIRLS------------- IS OF GREATEST VALUE TO THE CLUB LEADER. WHEN SHE KNOWS THEIR HOME LIFE--------- AND THEIR TRAINING, OR LACK OF IT, THERE COMES TO HER AN UNDERSTANDING--------- OF THEIR ACTIONS.- BEFORE I GIVE ANY ADVICE, I ALWAYS TRY TO PUT MYSELF--------- IN THE GIRL-S PLACE-, ONE CLUB LEADER HAS SAID.- IT-S SURPRISING BOW--------- OFTEN THIS CHANGES WHAT I HAD MEANT TO SAY-------------------------------------------------------------! LACK OF THIS VERY ABILITY TO PUT HERSELF IN THE--------- GIRL-S PLACE HAS BROUGHT MISUNDERSTANDING AND EVEN FAILURE INTO THE LIFE--------- OF MANY A LEADER. A CLUB LEADER IN A BUSINESS HOUSE ONCE DECIDED TO--------- ORGANIZE A CLUB AMONG SOME YOUNG GIRLS TO MEET DURING THE LUNCH HOUR.--------- THE GIRLS WERE INTERESTED IN DANCING, SO SHE TAUGHT THEM SIMPLE FOLK--------- DANCES. AT THE OUTSET, SHE HAD HAD IN MIND THE CONDUCTING OF A CLASS--------- LIKE THE PHYSICAL TRAINING CLASSES SHE HAD CONDUCTED IN HER GYMNASIUM.--------- SHE SOON FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT DO IT IN THAT WAY. AT FIRST SHE WAS--------- INCLINED TO REPRIMAND THE GIRLS FOR GETTING OUT OF LINE AND FOR--------- GIGGLING, BUT WHEN SHE STOPPED TO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT LUNCH TIME WAS--------- THEIR ONLY FREE HOUR DURING THE DAY, SHE SOON LOST ALL DESIRE TO SEE--------- THEM STANDING IN ROWS-, LEARNING STEPS THE ENTIRE TIME. SO THERE WAS NO--------- REPRIMAND FOR THE GIRLS WHO LAUGHED HEARTILY AT THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO DO--------- THE DANCES. SHE PROVIDED SONGS AND GAMES FOR PART OF THE HALF-HOUR WITH--------- THE RESULT THAT WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR THE DANCE WORK, THE GIRLS--------- INVARIABLY GAVE EARNEST ATTENTION TO IT. THE RESULT OF THIS POLICY ON--------- HER PART WAS THE CREATION OF AN ATMOSPHERE OF SOCIABILITY AND ENJOYMENT--------- RATHER THAN OF WORK TO BE DONE.----------------------- [PAGE------------------------------------------------------------ 27] A VISITING CLUB LEADER COMPLAINED OF HER INABILITY--------- TO HOLD HER GIRLS DURING LUNCH HOUR IN A SIMILAR CLUB. THE FIRST LEADER--------- VISITED THE OTHER-S ROOMS AND TALKED WITH THE GIRLS.---------------------------------- SHE MAKES US WORK ALL THE TIME ON THOSE DANCES----------, OBJECTED ONE-, AND SHE SAYS WE-RE SILLY WHEN WE LAUGH. HOW WOULD YOU--------- LIKE TO WORK ALL DAY AND NEVER LAUGH EVEN ON YOUR LUNCH HOUR--------------------?----------------- THE SECOND CLUB LEADER COULD NOT HAVE MADE THIS MISTAKE BAD SHE BEEN--------- ABLE TO SYMPATHETICALLY PUT HERSELF IN THE PLACE OF HER CLUB MEMBERS.-------------------------------------------------------- SELF-CONTROL----.---------------- PERPLEXING SITUATIONS ARE SURE TO ARISE IN THE LIFE OF A CLUB, SUCH AS--------- TRY THE LEADER-S PATIENCE TO THE UTMOST. IF, THROUGH THEM ALL, SHE IS--------- ABLE TO PRESERVE HER SELF-CONTROL, SHE WILL HAVE CONTRIBUTED VITALLY TO--------- THE DEVELOPMENT OF HER GIRLS, WHO ARE OFTEN SADLY IN NEED OF THAT VERY--------- SELF-CONTROL. THE FORCE OF A GOOD EXAMPLE IS PERHAPS NEVER EXERTED MORE--------- POWERFULLY- THAN IN SHOWING CONTROL OF ONE-S TEMPER WHEN THE CLUB WORK--------- IS DIFFICULT.- SHE NEVER GETS MAD WHEN YOU-RE BAD-, SAID ONE GIRL OF A--------- BELOVED CAMP DIRECTOR-, BUT SHE MAKES YOU FEEL PRETTY MEAN WHEN YOU--------- BREAK RULES, BECAUSE SHE-S ALWAYS SO SORRY ABOUT IT----------------------------------! AND SO IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE A LONG LIST OF--------- PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS WHICH ENABLE A CLUB LEADER TO EXERT A HELPFUL--------- INFLUENCE UPON HER GIRLS. PERHAPS THE BEST GENERAL RULE FOR THE LEADER--------- IS TO ALWAYS TRY TO BE WHAT SHE WISHES HER GIRLS TO BE. IF HER IDEAL IS--------- SUFFICIENTLY HIGH, SHE WILL NEVER ATTAIN IT. BUT IN THE STRIVING, SHE--------- WILL HELP NOT ONLY HER GIRLS BUT ALSO HERSELF, IMMEASURABLY.----------------------- [PAGE-------------------------------------------------------------------- 28] GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE GIRLS---------------------------------- THE EARNEST CLUB LEADER WILL AT-ONCE SET ABOUT--------- GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH HER GIRLS IN AS VITAL A WAY AS POSSIBLE. SHE HAS--------- BEEN GIVEN A GROUP OF GIRLS TO LEAD ALONG THE LINES OF USEFUL--------- DEVELOPMENT. THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CLUB AND HER PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP--------- WITH THEM MUST FURTHER THIS AIM. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, SHE MUST--------- KNOW EACH GIRL. HER HELP CAN THEN BE GIVEN WISELY. BUT SUCH ACQUAINTANCE--------- CANNOT BE GAINED, AT ONCE, NOR WITHOUT DEFINITELY SEARCHING FOR IT. FOR---------- KNOWING EACH GIRL- MEANS FAR MORE THAN BEING ABLE TO RECOGNIZE HER UPON--------- THE STREET AND CALLING HER BY NAME. IT INCLUDES ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER--------- FAMILY AND HER HOME LIFE, HER EDUCATION, HER SURROUNDINGS, HER--------- INTERESTS-IN SHORT, AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FORCES WHICH HAVE MADE HER--------- WHAT SHE IS. IF, A LEADER HAS DEFINITELY IN MIND WHAT SHE WISHES TO---------, KNOW ABOUT HER GIRLS, ANY CONVERSATION WILL GIVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY TO--------- LEARN THE DESIRED FACTS. IT MAY BE SOME TIME BEFORE THE LEADER KNOWS ALL--------- THAT SHE WISHES CONCERNING HER GIRLS. MANY CLUB LEADERS HAVE FOUND IT--------- FAR WISER TO APPROACH THE GIRLS GRADUALLY THAN TO GO TO THEM IN THE--------- ATTITUDE OF A CROSS-QUESTIONER AND BY CONSTANT QUESTIONING TO AROUSE--------- THEIR SUSPICIONS AND ANTAGONISM. A FRIEND- HOWEVER, CONFIDES IN A--------- FRIEND. ONCE A CLUB LEADER HAS PROVED HERSELF A-FRIEND TO HER GIRLS,----------GIRLISH CONFIDENCES FOLLOW AND THE LEADER IS IN A POSITION TO ADVISE AND--------- DIRECT WISELY.--------------------------------- JUST WHAT IT IS HELPFUL TO KNOW ABOUT A GROUP OF--------- GIRLS VARIES WITH THE- KIND OF GIRLS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP.

THE CLUB MEETS FOR ONE OR TWO HOURS EVERY WEEK OR TWO WEEKS.--------- THINK OF THE MANY OTHER HOURS DURING EACH WEEK WHEN OTHER FORCES, FOR--------- GOOD AND FOR EVIL, ARE TOUCHING THOSE SAME LIVES-! WHAT ARE THEY? HOW--------- CAN I WORK WITH THEM, AND IN THIS WAY ESTABLISH MORE FIRMLY THE WORK OF--------- MY OWN CLUB--------------------?-------- THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WHICH--------- COME BEFORE EVERY CLUB LEADER. OFTEN-THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES THROUGH THE--------- DESIRES OR NEEDS OF THE GIRLS. ONE OF THE CLUB GIRLS WISHES TO JOIN A--------- CHURCH. WHAT IS THE BEST ONE FOR HER, IN THE SECTION WHERE SHE LIVES? A--------- CLUB MEMBER IS EAGER TO STUDY STENOGRAPHY AND TYPEWRITING. WHERE IS THE--------- MOST THOROUGH COURSE GIVEN, AND AT WHAT PRICE? THE FATHER OF ONE OF THE--------- CLUB GIRLS IS LIVING A LIFE HARMFUL TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE FAMILY.--------- WHAT ORGANIZATION SHOULD SHE CONSULT FOR HELP? THE CLUB WISHES TO GIVE--------- SOME FINANCIAL HELP TO SOME GOOD CAUSE IN THE COMMUNITY. WHAT SHALL IT--------- BE? SUCH QUESTIONS AS THESE ARISE CONSTANTLY IN A GROWING GIRLS- CLUB.--------- THE ALERT CLUB LEADER WHO KNOWS THE ORGANIZATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF--------- HER OWN DISTRICT OR TOWN IS ABLE TO ANSWER THEM WITH PRACTICAL, DEFINITE--------- SUGGESTIONS, WHICH THE GIRLS CAN PUT INTO ACTION. MARGARET F.----------------------------- BYINGTON------- IN HER BOOKLET ON- WHAT SOCIAL--------- WORKERS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES-, HAS SAID OF HER--------- SUGGESTIONS:- THIS IS NOT A PLAN FOR A SOCIAL SURVEY; IT IS RATHER AN--------- OUTLINE OF THOSE FACTS ABOUT LOCAL CONDITIONS WHICH ARE A NECESSARY PART--------- OF THE EQUIPMENT FOR SERVICE OF THE VOLUNTEER OR--- [PAGE---- 32] OF THE--------- REGULAR IN THE SOCIAL ARMY. IN FULFILLING HIS TASK, WHATEVER IT MAY BE---------, EVERY SUCH WORKER MUST RELY FOR HELP ON THE ORGANIZED FORCES, ON STATE--------- LAWS AND LOCAL ORDINANCES, ON CITY, DEPARTMENTS AND VOLUNTEER AGENCIES.--------- HE WILL, MOREOVER, FIND HIS PROBLEM SO DOVETAILED WITH OTHER PROBLEMS--------- THAT ALL MUST BE WORKED OUT JOINTLY IF ANYTHING IS TO BE ACHIEVED.---------------------------------------- THE KNOWLEDGE OF THESE FORCES AND AGENCIES IS OF--------- SPECIAL IMPORTANCE TO ONE WHO WORKS AMONG NEEDY FAMILIES, SINCE HE MUST--------- UTILIZE THEM CONSTANTLY IN THE REHABILITATION OF INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES.--------- CONVERSELY, HE SHOULD LEARN FROM THE STUDY OF DEPENDENCY IN THESE--------- FAMILIES WHAT REFORMS ARE MOST NEEDED, AND HELP TO FOCUS THE EFFORTS OF--------- ALL AGENCIES WITH A SOCIAL PROGRAM ON THE REMOVAL OF EVILS THUS MADE--------- REAL TO HIM.---------------------------------------- THE GENERAL OUTLINE OF MISS------------------------------ BYINGTON-S------- SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING FACTS WHICH THE CLUB WORKER MAY--------- WELL KNOW IS AS FOLLOWS:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HISTORICAL SETTING OF THE COMMUNITY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CITY--------- ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ HOUSING.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ HEALTH.--------------------------- HEALTH ACTIVITIES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ RECREATION.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INDUSTRY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE--------- IMMIGRANT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ CHILDREN.--------------------------- CHILD--------------------- LABOR-------.----------------------------------- EDUCATION.--------------------------- JUVENILE--------- DELINQUENCY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ CHILD CARING.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ADULT DELINQUENTS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ NEEDY FAMILIES.--------------------------- PRIVATE RELIEF.----------------------------------- THE ORGANIZATION OF CHARITY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ PUBLIC OUTDOOR RELIEF.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ HOMELESS MEN.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE--------- AGED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION.--------------------------- FRATERNAL ORDERS.----------------------------------- WOMEN-S CLUBS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ BUSINESS MEN-S ASSOCIATIONS.--------------------------- LOCAL CIVIC--------- IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS.--------------------------- CHURCHES.---------- [PAGE---------------------------------------------- 33] MANY INTERESTED IN THE GIRL-PROBLEM HAVE GIVEN THIS--------- MATTER OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION SPECIAL STUDY AND HAVE COMPILED--------- OUTLINES OF DEFINITE HELP TO WORKERS WITH GIRLS. IN COLUMBUS, OHIO---------, THROUGH THE OFFICERS OF THE GIRLS- FRIENDLY SOCIETY, A SURVEY WAS--------- COMPILED OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR GIRLS IN- THAT CITY. THE LIST INCLUDED--------- OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT, AMUSEMENT, PROTECTION,----------------------------- LABOR------- LAWS, LEGAL AID, LODGINGS, LUNCH--------- ROOMS, SAVINGS, SETTLEMENTS AND CHURCHES.--------------------------------- THE YOUNG WOMEN-S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, IN ITS--------- PAMPHLET ON- SOME RESOURCES FOR WORK WITH GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN IN--------- TOWNS-, PLACES SUCH A SURVEY AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF GIRLS- WORK. THIS--------- PAMPHLET STATES:- THE PURPOSE OF A SURVEY IS NOT FOR PRYING, BUT FOR A--------- DEFINITE FOCUS ON FACTS-, GETTING ONE-S RANGE-, SO THAT THERE SHALL BE---------------------------- NEITHER HAZINESS------- OF AIM NOR WASTE OF ENERGY.--------- EACH PLACE IS A DIFFERENT PUZZLE, AND THE LIFE AND AMBITIONS OF GIRLS--------- ARE ALWAYS MORE OR LESS--------------------- COLORED------- BY THE--------- INFLUENCE PECULIAR TO EACH LOCALITY, SO THAT ONE MUST NEVER GENERALIZE.---------------------------------- THE OUTLINE SUGGESTED IN THIS PAMPHLET IS AS--------- FOLLOWS:--------------------------------------- SOURCES OF INFORMATION FOR THE SURVEY-------------------------------------------- DIRECT CONVERSATION WITH GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN------------------------------------.

HOW MANY GIRLS FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL HAVE GONE--------- TO COLLEGE IN THE LAST THREE YEARS? WHAT DETERMINED THE OTHERS NOT TO--------- GO? WHAT WORK HAVE THEY TAKEN UP?

WHAT IS THE TOTAL MEMBERSHIP? HOW MANY OF THE CHURCHES HAVE--------- ACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE-S ORGANIZATIONS? IS THERE A CITY UNION OF YOUNG--------- PEOPLE OR ANY OTHER INTERDENOMINATIONAL PLAN FOR WORKING TOGETHER?--------------------------------- A LARGE, GENERAL SURVEY OF THIS KIND, WHILE--------- SUGGESTIVE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CLUB LEADER, IS MUCH----------------------------- MORE BROAD------- IN SCOPE THAN SHE MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE. MISS ELIZA R.--------- BUTLER, IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY SCHOOL GIRL WORK---------, HAS FORMULATED AN OUTLINE FOR A SURVEY IN THAT FIELD WHICH SHOWS HOW THE--------- IDEA OF A SURVEY CAN BE ADAPTED TO SPECIAL PROBLEMS. THE FOLLOWING--------- POINTS ARE INCLUDED IN MISS BUTLER-S OUTLINE:------------------------------------ STUDY OF THE NATURE AND INTERESTS OF GIRLHOOD------------------------------------. SOCIAL PROGRAMS-TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF TIME--------- AVAILABLE FOR CLUB ACTIVITIES------------------------------------. SCHOOL REGULATIONS IN REGARD TO STUDENT--------- ACTIVITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS------------------------------------. STATE LAWS AND ORDINANCES CONCERNING THE USE OF--------- PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDINGS, ETC--------------------------------------------------------.

GREAT BENEFIT IS TO BE GAINED FROM--------- SUCH PERSONAL CONTACT AND FROM INFORMAL DISCUSSION OF THESE PROBLEMS.--------- THOSE WHO DIRECT LARGE ORGANIZATIONS MADE UP OF MANY CLUBS HAVE LONG--------- SINCE REALIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF GATHERING CLUB LEADERS TOGETHER. AND SO--------- IT IS THAT WE SEE THE CLUB LEADERS OF A SETTLEMENT HOUSE MEETING TO--------- DISCUSS THEIR PLANS; THE SECRETARIES AND THE VOLUNTEER WORKERS IN A Y.--------- W. C. A. COMING TOGETHER; WE HEAR OF CAMP FIRE GUARDIANS OR GIRL SCOUT--------- CAPTAINS CONFERRING IN SPECIAL SESSIONS. IN MANY PARTS OF THE UNITED--------- STATES SUCH GATHERINGS ARE NOT LIMITED TO SINGLE ORGANIZATIONS. GROUPS--------- OF LEADERS HAVE BEEN FORMED THAT ARE CITY-WIDE, COUNTY-WIDE, AND EVEN--------- COUNTRY-WIDE.--------------------------------- IN PHILADELPHIA THE LEADERS OF GIRLS IN THAT CITY--------- ARE UNITED IN THE GIRLS- CONFERENCE. ALL ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED IN--------- WORK FOR GIRLS ARE INVITED TO JOIN. THE CONFERENCE IS AN OPEN FORUM FOR--------- THE DISCUSSION OF CITY-GIRL PROBLEMS. FOUR OR MORE MEETINGS ARE HELD IN--------- THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, AND THE PROBLEMS ARE THEN PRESENTED AND--------- DISCUSSED. THE ROLL OF THE GIRLS- CONFERENCE INCLUDES ORGANIZATIONS OF--------- ALL KINDS-RELIGIOUS (JEWISH, CATHOLIC, AND PROTESTANT); REMEDIAL--------- ORGANIZATIONS; EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS; AND RECREATIONAL--------- ORGANIZATIONS. THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THIS CONFERENCE INCLUDES A GIRLS---------- HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CATHOLIC, JEWISH, AND----------------------------- COLORED-------, ORGANIZATIONS OF THE CITY, AND--------- REPRESENTATIVES FROM SUCH ORGANIZATIONS AS THE----------------------------- SALVATION---------------- [PAGE---- 37] ARMY, THE Y. W. C. A., THE GIRLS- AID--------- SOCIETY, AND THE--------------------- TRAVELERS-------- AID SOCIETY. A--------- MEETING OF A COMMITTEE OF THIS KIND GIVES MANY POINTS OF VIEW CONCERNING--------- THE GIRLS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE FOLLOWING SUBJECTS WHICH THE--------- PHILADELPHIA GIRLS- CONFERENCE HAS CONSIDERED SHOW THE PRACTICAL--------- PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE COME BEFORE THEM: -CLOSER COOPERATION OF ALL FIELD--------- WORKERS-;- VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND GUIDANCE AND FOLLOW-UP WORK OF GIRLS--------- OBTAINING WORKING PAPERS, WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO RECREATION AND--------- CHARACTER BUILDING-;- SOCIAL SERVICE FOR CASES HEARD IN MAGISTRATES---------- COURT-;- WORK WITH GIRLS AND WOMEN IN WAR TIMES-;- CONSTRUCTIVE WAR WORK--------- WITH GIRLS-, AND- RECREATION OF WOMEN AFFECTED BY WAR-TIME ACTIVITIES.---------------------------------- IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES, IT IS POSSIBLE TO BRING--------- TOGETHER THE SCHOOL TEACHERS AND THE SUNDAY- SCHOOL TEACHERS AS WELL AS--------- THOSE DIRECTLY CONCERNED-WITH CLUB WORK. THE BOYS- AND GIRLS---------- AGRICULTURAL CLUBS, WHICH HAVE BEEN LARGELY PROMOTED UNDER THE AUSPICES--------- OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, HAVE USED THE COUNTY AS A UNIT, AND--------- WITHIN A COUNTY HAVE BROUGHT THE CLUBS AND CLUB LEADERS INTO PERSONAL--------- TOUCH WITH ONE ANOTHER. IN THIS WAY THERE HAS BEEN CREATED A CORDIAL--------- FRIENDLINESS AND COOPERATION.--------------------------------------- TRAINING FOR THE NEW CLUB LEADER---------------------------------- CONTACT WITH EXPERIENCED CLUB LEADERS IS ESPECIALLY--------- VALUABLE TO THE NEW AND INEXPERIENCED LEADER. MANY YOUNG WOMEN JUST--------- STARTING OUT UPON THIS WORK HAVE RECEIVED VALUABLE SUGGESTIONS BY--------- TALKING WITH THOSE WHO HAVE FOR YEARS BEEN INTERESTED IN THIS LINE.--------- THOSE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF MANY CLUBS AND OF CLUB LEADERS HAVE PREPARED--------- FOR THESE LEADERS SHORT COURSES TO BE-------------------- GIVEN---------------- [PAGE------------- 38] AT SUMMER CONFERENCES OR WINTER MEETINGS. THE----------------------------- FOTLOWING------- COURSE FOR LEADERS WAS GIVEN UNDER--------- THE GIRLS- DIVISION OF THE NATIONAL SERVICE-COMMISSION, NEW YORK-CITY---------, IN THE FORM OF SIX LECTURES BY WOMEN OF EXPERIENCE IN GIRLS- WORK:--------------------------------------- A. THE CLUB AND ITS ORGANIZATION--------------------------------------------. HOW BEST TO REACH THE GIRLS.----------------------------------------- THE VALUE OF SELF-GOVERNMENT AND HOW TO OBTAIN--------- IT------------------------------------. THE NECESSARY STEPS IN THE FIRST THREE MEETINGS--------- OF A CLUB.--------------------------------------- B. THE CLUB AND ITS ACTIVITIES--------------------------------------------. HOW TO-WORK OUT A PROGRAM BASED ON--------- PHYSICAL-SERVICE RECREATIONAL LINES. THIS WOULD INCLUDE:--------------------------------- A. THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PHYSICAL WORK POSSIBLE--------- FOR GIRLS OF DIFFERENT AGES.---------------------THE ADVISABILITY OF ---------DRILL WORK.---------------------------------------- B.------DIFFERENT KINDS OF SERVICE WORK.--------------------------------- C.----- RECREATION IN GENERAL------------------------------------. DRAMATIC WORK FOR CLUBS.------------------------------PLAYS.--------------------------- PAGEANTRY.------------------------------------ COMMUNITY SINGING.---------------------------------------- A.----- EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF DRAMATICS.---------------------------- AESTHETIC-AND COMMUNITY SENSE TO BE DEVELOPED--------- THROUGH PAGEANTRY.---------------------------------------- B.

HOW TO USE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND THE ART--------- MUSEUM.----------------------- [PAGE------------------------------------------------------ 39] PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION OF CLUB PLANS WHICH--------- HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR GIRLS, SUCH AS,--------------------------------- A.----- GIRL SCOUT WORK.----------------------------------------------------- B-------.----- CAMP FIRE WORK.----------------------------------------------------- C-------. WOODCRAFT LEAGUE--------- WORK.--------------------------------- D. PROTECTIVE LEAGUE WORK------------------------------------. FORUM MEETING FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSIONS.------------------------------------------- CONTACT WITH CLUB LEADERS THROUGH--------- PUBLICATIONS---------------------------------- MANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WHICH TOUCH UPON THE--------- VARIOUS PHASES OF GIRLS- CLUB WORK, AND THE PERIODICALS WHICH ARE--------- PUBLISHED BY THE VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS GIVE TO EVERY CLUB LEADER A--------- SPLENDID OPPORTUNITY FOR GATHERING NEW IDEAS FOR HER CLUB. THE CAMP FIRE--------- GIRLS- HANDBOOK (FIFTY CENTS); THE HANDBOOK FOR GIRL SCOUTS (THIRTY--------- CENTS); THE WOODCRAFT MANUAL FOR GIRLS OF THE WOODCRAFT LEAGUE (FIFTY--------- CENTS-)ALL OF THESE OUTLINE IN GREATEST DETAIL MANY ACTIVITIES FOR--------- GIRLS. THE MONTHLY PUBLICATIONS OF THE LARGE ORGANIZATIONS OF GIRLS AND--------- YOUNG WOMEN GIVE MANY SUGGESTIONS FOR THE ACTUAL CARRYING OUT OF THESE--------- ACTIVITIES. THERE IS NO ISSUE OF-THE FOLLOWING GIRLS ---CLUB MAGAZINES--------- WHICH DOES NOT CONTAIN DEFINITE SUGGESTIONS FOR CLUB WORK, EITHER IN THE--------- SPECIAL ARTICLES WRITTEN BY TRAINED CLUB WORKERS, OR IN THE REPORTS--------- WHICH THE GIRLS THEMSELVES CONTRIBUTE. ANY GIRLS- CLUB LEADER WILL FIND--------- HELP IN THE- ASSOCIATION MONTHLY- (Y. W. C. A. PUBLICATION, ONE DOLLAR A--------- YEAR);---------------------- WOHELO-------- (CAMP FIRE GIRLS- MAGAZINE---------, ONE DOLLAR A YEAR);- THE RALLY- (GIRL SCOUTS- MAGAZINE, ONE DOLLAR A--------- YEAR);- THE CLUB WORKER- (PUBLISHED BY THE NATIONAL LEAGUE OF WOMEN--------- WORKERS, THIRTY CENTS A YEAR). BY SUBSCRIBING TO ONE OR ALL OF THESE--------- PUBLICATIONS ANY CLUB LEADER CAN, AT-------------------- A---------------- [PAGE------------- 40] SMALL EXPENSE, RECEIVE A CONSTANT INFLUX OF NEW IDEAS. IT--------- MATTERS LITTLE WHETHER OR NOT SHE HAS A GROUP OF GIRLS UNDER ANY OF--------- THESE PARTICULAR ORGANIZATIONS; THERE IS SUGGESTION AND INSPIRATION FOR--------- HER IN ALL WORK WHICH IS BEING CARRIED ON AMONG GIRLS.------------------------------------------ COOPERATION WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS---------------------------------- MANY CLUB LEADERS HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE OTHERS--------- LIVING IN THE SAME COMMUNITY WHO ARE WILLING TO HELP IN THE WORK OF--------- THEIR CLUBS. THESE OTHERS ARE NOT WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE WORK OF A--------- CLUB, BUT THEY ARE GLAD TO GIVE THEIR HELP IN COACHING A PLAY, IN--------- TRAINING A GLEE CLUB FOR A CERTAIN CONCERT, OR IN ARRANGING FOR A--------- SPECIAL OUTING. THE CLUB LEADER WHO MAKES USE OF NOT ONLY HER OWN--------- TALENTS BUT ALSO THOSE OF HER FRIENDS FINDS HELP WAITING FOR HER WHERE--------- SHE MAY LEAST EXPECT IT.--------------------------------- ONE CLUB LEADER IN A LARGE CITY SUCCESSFULLY--------- INTRODUCED THE- BIG SISTER- IDEA INTO HER CLUB WORK. HER GIRLS WERE OF A--------- KIND WHO NEEDED A LARGE AMOUNT OF INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION. SHE HERSELF WAS--------- UNABLE TO GIVE IT. SO SHE SOUGHT THE HELP OF A NUMBER OF HER FRIENDS---------, ASKING EACH ONE TO TAKE ONE GIRL IN THE CLUB AND BE HER- BIG SISTER----------, TAKING HER OUT TO WHOLESOME PLEASURES, WATCHING HER, AND ADVISING HER.--------- THE PLAN WAS WELL WORTH THE EFFORT, AND THE GIRLS PROFITED BY THESE--------- HELPFUL FRIENDSHIPS.-------------------------------------------------- THE NEW CLUB LEADER---------------------------------- THE NUMEROUS POSSIBILITIES IN GIRLS- CLUB WORK--------- SHOULD CAUSE NO YOUNG WOMAN WHO IS GENUINELY INTERESTED IN IT TO--------- HESITATE IN UNDERTAKING IT-------------------- THERE------- IS HELP FOR--------- HER AT EVERY TURN, THROUGH THESE MANY AND VARIOUS CHANNELS. SHE MAY FEEL--------- THAT HER TALENTS ARE--------------------- MEAGER------- AND THAT SHE IS--------- NOT WELL-EQUIPPED. BUT AS HER CLUB GROWS AND DEVELOPS, SHE, TOO, WILL--------- GROW AND DEVELOP. THE GIRLS THEMSELVES AND THOSE READY AND ANXIOUS TO--------- HELP HER WILL TEACH HER. AS DR. LUTHER H.--------------------- GULICK----------------, PRESIDENT OF THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS, HAS SAID-, THE PARADOX OF LIFE IS THAT--------- WE KEEP THAT PART OF IT WHICH WE GIVE TO OTHERS AND THAT WE LOSE THAT--------- WHICH WE SAVE FOR OURSELVES. THE-------------------- BREATH OF THE--------- SPIRIT IS LIKE THE BREEZE-GRASP------- IT TO HOLD AND THERE IS NOTHING.--------- IT IS LIKE THE HEART WHICH GROWS BY GIVING LOVE. WITHOUT LOVE, SAVE IT---------, AND THE HEART-------------------- IS------- EMPTY.-------------------------------------- HOW TO CITE THIS PIECE----:------ FERRIS, H.
