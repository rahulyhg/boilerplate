THIS INTERPRETATION OF THE DOCUMENT SHOULD NOT TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER--- THE PRINCIPLES RECALLED ABOVE.------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASING BLOOD AND PLASMA--- AS ONE WOULD BUY A RAW MATERIAL AND SELLING PLASMA DERIVATIVES, WOULD BE A NEGATION--- OF THE ABOVE PRINCIPLES.-------------------------------------------------------------- ANY CONCESSION, ON THE PRETEXT--- THAT BLOOD IS A RENEWABLE TISSUE AND THAT LIMITED DONATION CANNOT BE HARMFUL---, WOULD TRANSGRESS THE RULE WHICH ENSURES THAT HUMAN DIGNITY IS RESPECTED. ONCE--- BLOOD HAS BECOME A COMMERCIAL ITEM, ALL OTHER TISSUES AND ORGANS COULD GO THE--- SAME WAY.------------------------------------------------------------------- IN EUROPE A MAJOR EFFORT--- IS IN PROGRESS-TO BRING NATIONS CLOSER TOGETHER, IN PARTICULAR ECONOMICALLY.--- THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, WHEN IT ADOPTED RECOMMENDATION--- N  R-90-9 OF 29TH MARCH, 1990 WHICH STATES--- " FOR REASONS BOTH ETHICAL AND--- CLINICAL, BLOOD DONATION SHOULD BE VOLUNTARY-AND SHOULD NOT GIVE RISE TO REMUNERATION------- ", IS IN FACT TAKING A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.-------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE--- ETHICS COMMITTEE THEREBY FINDS REASON TO DECLARE THAT-UNIFICATION WILL NOT BE----ACHIEVED SUCCESSFULLY, AND-THEREFORE THE IDEAL OF ARRIVING AT HARMONISATION--- WILL NOT BE ATTAINED, IF SOLELY ECONOMIC INTERESTS ARE TAKEN ACCOUNT OF, WITHOUT--- ANY REFERENCE TO THE ETHICAL VALUES WHICH THIS OPINION REAFFIRMS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ REPORT--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLOOD TRANSFUSION HAS BEEN--- FOR A LONG TIME ONE OF THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE ETHICS COMMITTEE'S PARTICULAR--- PREOCCUPATIONS-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. THE SUBJECT HAS JUST SPRUNG TO THE FOREGROUND OF NATIONAL CONCERNS IN DRAMATIC--- CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS REPORT COMES THEREFORE AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS COINCIDENCE--- BETWEEN ACTION BASED ON A PRINCIPLE AND THE TESTING OF THAT PRINCIPLE BY CURRENT--- EVENTS.-------------------------------------------------------------- EARLY IN 1990, OUR COMMITTEE--- EMBARKED ON AN IN DEPTH STUDY ON THE THEME OF "ETHICS AND MONEY", THE PERTINENCE--- OF WHICH NEVER CEASES TO BE PATENT IN MOST OF THE MATTERS WE ARE ASKED TO CONSIDER.--- AS A FIRST STEP IN THIS LONG TERM CONSIDERATION OF THE MATTER, IN THE------- " JOURN------- ES NATIONALES D'ETHIQUE---- " IN DECEMBER 1990, THE COMMITTEE RE-AFFIRMED--- THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF NOT MAKING COMMERCIAL USE OF THE HUMAN BODY. SINCE--- THAT TIME, WORK HAS PROGRESSED. ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WHICH WE FEEL WE HAVE COMPLETED--- OUR CONSIDERATION OF, AND WHICH WILL BE ONE OF THE MAJOR-COMPONENTS OF THE FINAL--- REPORT, IS BLOOD TRANSFUSION. AS OF NOW, IT CAN BE THE SUBJECT OF A REPORT AND--- A FIRM OPINION.------------------------------------------------------------------- FRANCE PLAYED A LEADING--- ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLOOD TRANSFUSION. THE FIRST TRANSFUSIONS, THE FIRST--- TRANSFUSION CENTRE (SAINT-ANTOINE, 1929), THE FIRST ORGANISED TRANSFUSION SYSTEM--- ON A NATIONAL SCALE, ALL TOOK PLACE IN OUR COUNTRY. FURTHERMORE, AS EARLY AS--- 1950, THE PRINCIPLE OF UNPAID BLOOD DONATION WAS ADOPTED AND MADE THE FRENCH--- SYSTEM AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED ETHICAL MODEL.------------------------------------------------------------------- AND YET, THAT WHICH SEEMED--- TO HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED ONCE AND FOR ALL IS CHALLENGED IN A TIME OF CRISIS---, WITH CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY TURN OUT TO BE VERY SERIOUS OR PERHAPS IRREPARABLE.---------------------------------------------------------------------- THERE IS A DUAL ASPECT TO--- THIS CRISIS. THE FIRST, WHICH HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT-OF MUCH DISCUSSION AND COMMENT---, IS A LOSS OF FAITH. THE DISCOVERY THAT HUNDREDS OF HAEMOPHILIACS WERE CONTAMINATED--- BY THE AIDS VIRUS AT A TIME WHEN EFFECTIVE DECONTAMINATION OF ANTI-HAEMOPHILIC--- PRODUCTS HAD NOT BECOME GENERALISED, I.E. BEFORE MID-1985, PROVOKED CONSTERNATION--- WITH WHICH WE ENTIRELY SYMPATHISE. QUERIES, CRITICISM, AND DOUBTS ABOUND. WHO--- BEARS RESPONSIBILITY OR, IN SOME CASES BLAME, DURING THIS PERIOD----- ? CHANGES----IN OUTLOOK SINCE THAT TIME, BROUGHT ABOUT BY AN ENORMOUS ACCUMULATION OF RECENTLY--- ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE, COMPLICATES THE TASK-OF JUDGING WITH HINDSIGHT AND TAKING--- INTO ACCOUNT SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTIES AND TECHNOLOGICAL HESITATIONS OF A PERIOD--- NOW PAST. THE COURTS WILL HAVE THE TASK OF-THROWING ALL POSSIBLE LIGHT ON THIS--- DISTRESSING ISSUE, AS DEVASTATED FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES JUSTIFIABLY DEMAND---, AND MAKING WHATEVER REPARATION THEY MAY BE ENTITLED TO.------------------------------------------------------------------- WE HAVE NEITHER AUTHORITY--- TO INTERVENE IN SUCH PROCEDURES, NOR ANY INCLINATION TO DO SO.------------------------------------------------------------------- THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE--- PRESENT CRISIS, LESS APPARENT PERHAPS TO PUBLIC OPINION, IS IN FACT OF MUCH--- GREATER SCOPE AND GRAVITY. WE REFER TO THE FACT THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SYSTEM--- AS A WHOLE ARE QUESTIONED, AND THAT THESE PRINCIPLES ARE VIEWED IN A EQUIVOCAL--- LIGHT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE IN NO WAY INVOLVED IN THE CALAMITOUS EVENTS BEFORE--------- OUR MISSION DOES NOT QUALIFY US TO EVALUATE THE FAILINGS OF THE SYSTEM OR OF--- ITS STRUCTURES, OR THEIR CAUSES NOR WHO IS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. BUT THIS--- MISSION DEFINITELY EMPOWERS US TO MAKE A FIRM ETHICAL STAND UPHOLDING THOSE--- PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE : ABSENCE OF GAIN, AND BANNING COMMERCIAL USE OF THE HUMAN--- BODY.------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES WHICH HAVE BEEN--- INTRODUCED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IN THE---- CENTRE NATIONAL POUR LA TRANSFUSION--- SANGUINE---- (NATIONAL BLOOD TRANSFUSION CENTRE) COULD, IF THEY WERE TO PERSIST---, GRAVELY IMPERIL THE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE REMARKABLE--- AND ORIGINAL QUALITIES OF THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE.------------------------------------------------------------------- THESE CHANGES WERE BROUGHT--- ABOUT BY REVOLUTIONARY TECHNICAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROCESS OF BLOOD TRANSFUSION.--- TRADITIONALLY, TRANSFUSION WAS A DIRECT TRANSFER OF WHOLE BLOOD, BUT HAS NOW--- EVOLVED SO THAT ELECTIVE USE IS MADE OF THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF BLOOD AND--- PLASMA, ACCORDING TO THE PATIENT'S SPECIFIC NEEDS. IN THIS WAY, PROCESSES OF--- AN ALMOST INDUSTRIAL NATURE HAVE APPEARED SUCH AS INDUSTRIAL EXTRACTION AND--- PREPARATION OF STABILISED PRODUCTS FOR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES. THIS DUAL EVOLUTION--- HAS LED IN SOME COUNTRIES, THE UNITED STATES IN PARTICULAR, TO A PHARMACEUTICAL--- STATUTE FOR THE INSTITUTIONS PREPARING THE PRODUCTS. INDUSTRIAL LOGIC LEADS--- TO A COMMERCIALISATION OF THE WHOLE PROCESS, BLOOD IS BOUGHT, AND ITS COMPONENTS--- ARE SOLD, AFTER PREPARATION.------------------------------------------------------------------- THE RISK OF THIS KIND OF--- DEVELOPMENT IN FRANCE IS ALL THE LESS NEGLIGIBLE SINCE THE EUROPEAN ARRANGEMENTS--- WHICH WILL BECOME MANDATORY IN 1993 MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION.------------------------------------------------------------------- THERE IS DANGER FOR THE--- FUTURE OF OUR SYSTEM IN BOTH OF ITS ASPECTS : UNPAID BLOOD DONATION, AND THE--- NON-LUCRATIVE CHARACTER OF SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITIES.------------------------------------------------------------------- WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AN--- ERA OF INDUSTRIAL LOGIC : THAT CANNOT BE AVOIDED. WE ARE NOW THREATENED BY COMMERCIAL--- LOGIC : IS IT AVOIDABLE----- ? THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WE WISH TO BROACH--- AFTER CONSIDERING :--------------------------------------------------------------------  DEVELOPMENTS IN TRANSFUSION------------------------------------------------------------------  FEATURES OF THE FRENCH--- SYSTEM---------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN DIRECTIVES ON--- BLOOD AND PLASMA, AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ DEVELOPMENTS IN TRANSFUSION-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE EXPRESSION 'BLOOD TRANSFUSION'--- NOW INCLUDES :------------------------------------------------------------------------ COLLECTION OF WHOLE BLOOD- OR OF PLASMA ONLY (PLASMAPHERESIS)-------------------------------------------------------------------------- SEPARATION OF THE BLOOD- COMPONENTS : ON ONE HAND, CELLULAR COMPONENTS - RED BLOOD CELLS, WHITE BLOOD CELLS-, AND PLATELETS; ON THE OTHER HAND, PLASMA DERIVATIVES OBTAINED BY FRACTIONATION--------------------------------------------------------------------------- REINJECTION OF WHOLE BLOOD- VERY RARELY, USUALLY ONLY ONE OR OTHER OF ITS COMPONENTS, DEPENDING ON THE PATIENT'S- NEED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE INCREASING COMPLEXITY--- OF TRANSFUSION TECHNIQUES IS DUE TO TECHNICAL PROGRESS AND TO NEW INDICATIONS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TECHNICAL PROGRESS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A BLOODLESS HUMAN DIES.--- THIS OBVIOUS FACT LED A VERY LONG TIME AGO TO THE CONCEPT OF TRANSFUSION. AFTER--- VERY DISAPPOINTING EARLY ATTEMPTS WITH ANIMAL BLOOD, THE USE OF HUMAN BLOOD--- AT THE END OF THE 19TH CENTURY RAISED HOPES. THEY WERE FREQUENTLY DASHED, HOWEVER---, BY INEXPLICABLE FAILURES.------------------------------------------------------------------- THEY REMAINED UNEXPLAINED--- UNTIL LANDSTEINER, IN 1900, DISCOVERED THAT ALL HUMAN BLOOD WAS NOT IDENTICAL--- - NEITHER IDENTICAL NOR, WORSE STILL, COMPATIBLE. AN ESSENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH--- WAS THE DISCOVERY OF THE FIRST THREE HUMAN BLOOD GROUPS, A, O, B, WHICH ARE--- THE MOST IMPORTANT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF COMPATIBILITY.------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS DECISIVE STEP FORWARD--- AND THE NEEDS ENGENDERED BY WORLD WAR I TRIGGERED EARLY APPLICATIONS. AT THE--- TIME, TRANSFUSION WAS DIRECT FROM ARM TO ARM. AFTER THE WAR, VARIOUS DEVICES--- GREATLY FACILITATED THE PROCEDURE.------------------------------------------------------------------- IN 1929, ARNAULT TZANCK---, WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE PIONEERS OF THE TECHNIQUE, FOUNDED THE FIRST BLOOD TRANSFUSION--- CENTRE IN PARIS, AT THE HOSPITAL SAINT-ANTOINE. PHYSICIANS AND DONORS WERE ON--- STANDBY AROUND THE CLOCK SO AS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO ANY EMERGENCY IN ALL--- OF THE PARIS HOSPITALS. THIS WAS THE FIRST TRANSFUSION SYSTEM.------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD WAR II BROUGHT FURTHER--- PROGRESS : THE PRESERVATION OF BLOOD. BLOOD COULD BE STABILISED AND STORED FOR--- SEVERAL DAYS FOR TRANSPORT AND USED ELSEWHERE, AT A LATER TIME. MOREOVER, IT--- COULD BE CHECKED BIOLOGICALLY BEFORE USE.------------------------------------------------------------------- AFTER THE WAR, BLOOD TRANSFUSION--- CENTRES WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE MAJOR HOSPITALS. SOME OF THEM BEGAN TO USE SEPARATION--- TECHNIQUES SO THAT BLOOD CELLS AND PLASMA COULD BE USED SEPARATELY.------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE--- TO AN INCREASE IN DEMAND, I.E. IN INDICATIONS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  DEVELOPMENT OF INDICATIONS AND INDUSTRIALISATION OF PLASMATIC FRACTIONATION------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- INITIALLY DESIGNED TO CORRECT--- A PARTIAL LOSS OF BLOOD VOLUME, TRANSFUSION WAS IN THE BEGINNING AN INJECTION--- OF WHOLE BLOOD. THE ONLY INDICATION AT THE TIME, HAEMORRHAGE, SEEMED TO LOGICALLY--- CALL FOR THIS KIND OF GLOBAL COMPENSATION. HOWEVER, PROGRESS IN THE TECHNOLOGY--- OF RESUSCITATION DURING WORLD WAR II, REVEALED THAT THE MOST THREATENING CHARACTERISTIC--- OF A HAEMORRHAGE IS A COLLAPSE OF CIRCULATION DUE TO A DROP IN BLOOD VOLUME.--- THE IDEA WAS BORN OF REPLACING AS A PRIORITY THE MISSING VOLUME WITH PLASMA--- ONLY, IF NECESSARY. PLASMA, ONCE SEPARATED FROM BLOOD CELLS CAN BE EASILY STORED--- AND PRESERVED. THE ADVANTAGE THEREFORE IS GREATER AVAILABILITY. ONCE BLOOD VOLUME--- HAS BEEN RESTORED, THE LOSS OF RED BLOOD CELLS HAS TO BE COMPENSATED, BUT IT--- IS THEN ONLY NECESSARY TO INJECT CELLS IN THE CONCENTRATED FORM WHICH IS THE--- RESULT OF FRACTIONATION. THUS, THE CONCEPT OF SELECTIVE TRANSFUSION BEGAN TO--- EMERGE IN THE 1960S.------------------------------------------------------------------- IN PARALLEL, INDICATIONS--- MULTIPLIED AND CEASED TO BE PURELY SURGICAL. CLINICAL INDICATIONS INCLUDED CORRECTING--- ANEMIAS, WHITE BLOOD CELL AND PLATELET DEFICIENCIES, OR A LACK OF CERTAIN PLASMA--- COMPONENTS SUCH AS CLOTTING FACTORS.------------------------------------------------------------------- IN EACH OF THESE CASES---, IT SEEMED LOGICAL TO INJECT ONLY THE MISSING COMPONENT. FURTHERMORE, SELECTIVE--- TRANSFUSION SAVES BLOOD. VARIOUS THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS CAN BE DERIVED FROM THE--- SAME BLOOD DONATION.-------------------------------------------------------------------- THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNIQUES--- FOR SEPARATING BLOOD INTO CELLS AND PLASMA AND THEN ISOLATING THE COMPONENT--- PROTEINS OF PLASMA, A PROCESS WHICH IS CALLED PLASMA FRACTIONATION, NATURALLY--- ENSUED.------------------------------------------------------------------------ THESE SEPARATION TECHNIQUES--- GIVE RISE TO TWO KIND OF PRODUCTS :------------------------------------------------------------------------ CELLULAR COMPONENTS (LABILE- PRODUCTS) WHICH CANNOT BE STORED FOR ANY GREAT LENGTH OF TIME :A FEW WEEKS FOR- RED BLOOD CELLS, AND ONLY A FEW DAYS FOR WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND PLATELETS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ PLASMATIC FRACTIONS, WHICH- ARE MUCH MORE STABLE AND CAN BE STORED FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR EACH--- OF THESE TWO KINDS OF PROCEDURES VARIES CONSIDERABLY. PRODUCTION OF LABILE PRODUCTS--- DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY VERY COMPLEX EQUIPMENT. IT CAN BE DONE BY MOST BLOOD TRANSFUSION--- CENTRES. PLASMA FRACTIONATION, HOWEVER, REQUIRES COMPLEX MACHINERY. YOU COULD--- SAY THAT LABILE PRODUCTS CAN BE PREPARED IN AN UNSOPHISTICATED ENVIRONMENT---, PROCESSED AND USED IN UNIT FORM, BUT WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS OF VERIFYING COMPATIBILITY--- AT THE TIME THEY ARE USED. ON THE CONTRARY, STABLE PRODUCTS FALL INTO THE CATEGORY--- OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES IN BATCHES OF SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF LITRES OF PLASMA.--- THESE PRODUCTS ARE STANDARDISED AND CAN BE USED BY ANYONE FOLLOWING PRESCRIPTIONS--- FOR INDICATIONS AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.------------------------------------------------------------------- THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLASMA--- FRACTIONATION ACTIVITIES HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES PROCESSING--- PLASMA IN GIGANTIC QUANTITIES : SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LITRES A YEAR.----------------------------------------------------------------- INITIALLY, PLASMA WAS THE--- RESULT OF SEPARATION OF THE CELL COMPONENTS FROM WHOLE BLOOD; IT WAS A KIND--- OF "BY-PRODUCT" OF THE PREPARATION OF LABILE PRODUCTS BY BLOOD TRANSFUSION CENTRES.--- BUT AS THE GROWTH OF DEMAND FOR STABLE FRACTIONS OUTPACED THE GROWTH OF DEMAND--- FOR LABILE PRODUCTS, THE RESULT WAS SELECTIVE COLLECTION. CERTAIN MACHINES CAN---, DURING THE COLLECTION OF BLOOD FROM A DONOR, SEPARATE THE CELLULAR COMPONENTS--- WHICH ARE RE-INJECTED, AND KEEP ONLY THE PLASMA. THIS IS CALLED PLASMAPHERESIS--- AND ALLOWS FOR COLLECTION OF LARGER AND MUCH MORE FREQUENT DONATIONS THAN IS--- THE CASE WITH WHOLE BLOOD.------------------------------------------------------------------- IN THIS WAY, AND PARTICULARLY--- IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, AN INDEPENDENT PLASMA INDUSTRY HAS EVOLVED WHICH CLOSELY--- RESEMBLES THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  DEVELOPMENTS IN TRANSFUSION IN OTHER COUNTRIES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WE ARE NOT ATTEMPTING TO--- GIVE AN OVERALL VIEW OF TRANSFUSION WORLD WIDE. WE SIMPLY WISH TO GIVE AN IMPRESSION--- OF THE DIVERSITY THAT EXISTS USING A FEW EXAMPLES WHICH WILL HELP TO UNDERSTAND--- THE SPECIFICITY AND HARMONY OF THE FRENCH SYSTEM WHICH WILL BE DESCRIBED BELOW.---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE UNITED STATES ARE A--- SPECIAL CASE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. FIRSTLY, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO TYPES--- OF TRANSFUSION CENTRES, THOSE RUN BY THE RED CROSS, AND OTHERS WITH WIDELY DIFFERING--- STATUTES. ONLY THE FIRST CATEGORY APPLY THE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES OF NON PAYMENT--- OF DONORS, AND NON-PROFIT FOR THE CENTRE. BUT THE MAJOR SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTIC--- OF THE COUNTRY IS THE ENORMOUS DEVELOPMENT OF A PLASMA INDUSTRY RUN BY A FEW--- LARGE COMPANIES ALONG COMMERCIAL LINES. THEY BUY THE PLASMA OBTAINED BY PLASMAPHERESIS--- AND SELL THE FRACTIONS IN THE SAME WAY AS MEDICINAL DRUGS (THEY MAY ALSO SELL--- THE NON PROCESSED PLASMA AS A--- " RAW MATERIAL---- " TO FRACTIONATING CENTRES---, EVEN IN EUROPE AS WE SHALL SEE). AS THESE COMPANIES ARE VERY DYNAMIC THEY PRODUCE--- QUANTITIES FAR HIGHER THAN ARE NEEDED ON THE AMERICAN HOME MARKET (NEEDS ARE--- EVALUATED AT ABOUT----- 3 000 000 LITRES OF PLASMA WHEREAS ABOUT-------- 9 000 000 LITRES ARE DRAWN). AS A RESULT, THEY EXPORT A GREAT DEAL OF THEIR PRODUCTION--- AT PRICES WHICH ON THE WHOLE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THOSE PRACTISED BY--- FRACTIONATING CENTRES USING DONATED PLASMA. THIS IS BECAUSE AS "DONORS" ARE--- PAID, CONDITIONS ARE IMPOSED ON THEM WHICH ENSURE BETTER PRODUCTIVITY FROM THE--- PLASMAPHERESIS MACHINES AND BLOOD CENTRE STAFF.------------------------------------------------------------------- FOR A LONG TIME, JAPAN IMPORTED--- BLOOD PRODUCTS FROM THE UNITED STATES FOR TWO REASONS : ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE--- NOT ENOUGH BLOOD WAS COLLECTED, BUT EVEN MORE BECAUSE CONSUMPTION WAS EXCESSIVE---, PARTICULARLY OF PLASMATIC PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, CONTAMINATION OF HAEMOPHILIACS--- BY THE AIDS VIRUS AT A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS VIRTUALLY FREE OF SEXUAL CONTAMINATION---, LED TO A RADICAL CHANGE OF POLICY.-------------------------------------------------------------- SELF-SUFFICIENCY BASED ON--- VOLUNTARY DONATION AND A SLOWING DOWN OF CONSUMPTION IS NOT FAR OFF, WHICH IS--- BEGINNING TO WORRY AMERICAN EXPORTERS AND INCITE THEM TO TURN THEIR EYES IN--- THE DIRECTION OF EUROPE.------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN TRANSFUSION CENTRES--- DIFFER NOTABLY IN THE WAY THEY ARE ORGANISED AND-THEIR DEGREE OF EFFICIENCY.--- THE FRENCH SYSTEM WITH CENTRES AS PART OF A PUBLIC SERVICE EXERCISING A MONOPOLY--- IS AN EXCEPTION. IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, SUCH AS BELGIUM, HOLLAND, AND DENMARK---, THE RED CROSS IS IN CHARGE OF ORGANISING BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND SEES TO IT THAT--- THE RULES OF UNPAID DONATION AND ABSENCE OF PROFIT ARE RESPECTED. HOWEVER, IN--- CERTAIN COUNTRIES, GERMANY IN PARTICULAR, PAYING THE DONOR IS NOT PROHIBITED.--- ANOTHER PARTICULARITY OF THE COUNTRY, IS THAT GERMANY CONSUMES VAST QUANTITIES--- OF PLASMA, ALBUMIN, AND ANTIHEMOPHILIC FACTORS, AND THEREFORE IMPORTS LARGE--- VOLUMES OF AMERICAN PLASMA (-----800 000 LITRES ANNUALLY). GLOBALLY, EUROPE--- JUST ABOUT SATISFIES ITS DOMESTIC MARKET FOR LABILE PRODUCTS. FOR PLASMATIC--- PRODUCTS HOWEVER, IT MUST IMPORT ABUNDANT QUANTITIES EITHER AS PLASMA, OR AS--- FINISHED PRODUCTS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TRANSFUSION IN THE FUTURE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN FRANCE AND IN MOST COUNTRIES--- WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE DEVELOPMENT, THERE IS A LEVELLING OFF OF--- BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCT CONSUMPTION. IT WOULD NOT BE UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT--- A DOWNTURN IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. SEVERAL REASONS MAY BE INVOLVED.------------------------------------------------------------------- FIRSTLY, AS A CONSEQUENCE--- OF HIV CONTAMINATION, THERE IS INCREASING AWARENESS OF THE RISK OF INFECTION---, VIRAL INFECTION IN PARTICULAR. EVEN WHEN THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AND CAN BE DETECTED---, THERE IS ALWAYS A RESIDUAL RISK (AT PRESENT, THE RISK OF HIV TRANSMISSION IS--- ESTIMATED AT 1 IN 100.000 TO 1 IN 200.000 TRANSFUSIONS). BUT MORE MENACING IS--- THE RISK OF NEW INFECTIONS FOR WHICH THERE IS BOUND TO BE A LAG BEFORE PREVENTIVE--- MEASURES ARE APPLIED.------------------------------------------------------------------- AT FIRST, ONLY THE MEDICAL--- PROFESSION WAS APPREHENSIVE ABOUT TRANSFUSION RISKS, BUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC--- IS ALSO BECOMING WARY. SUCH FEARS ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL AGENTS FOR--- REDUCING CONSUMPTION WHICH HAD REACHED IN SOME CASES EXCESSIVE LEVELS.------------------------------------------------------------------- APART FROM A MORE SELECTIVE--- CHOICE OF INDICATIONS, ANOTHER TREND IS TO FIND NEW METHODS TO EITHER REPLACE--- BLOOD WITH ARTIFICIAL SUBSTANCES (AS WE HAVE SEEN PREVIOUSLY, PLASMA SUBSTITUTES--- TO REPLACE BLOOD VOLUME), OR TO USE THE PATIENT'S OWN BLOOD FOR A TRANSFUSION--- INSTEAD OF BLOOD SUPPLIED BY A DONOR. THIS IS CALLED---- AUTOLOGOUS DONATION------- AND IS USED IN ELECTIVE SURGERY WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT SOME TIME IN--- ADVANCE THAT TRANSFUSION WILL BE NEEDED.------------------------------------------------------------------- PLASMATIC FRACTIONS ARE--- LIKELY TO MODIFY TO THE GREATEST EXTENT THE PRESENT SITUATION. THEY ARE PURE--- PROTEINS, CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND IT IS THOUGHT THERE COULD BE HOPES OF CREATING--- THEM BY GENETIC ENGINEERING. TWO AMERICAN FIRMS HAVE ALREADY MANUFACTURED A--- FACTOR VIII WHICH IS OUT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL STAGE AND AWAITING APPROVAL. THE--- FRENCH NATIONAL TRANSFUSION CENTRE IS ALSO WORKING ON A FACTOR VIII BUT IS A--- LITTLE LESS ADVANCED. REQUIREMENTS FOR PLASMATIC FACTOR VIII, WHICH WAS THE--- COMPONENT WHICH CONDITIONED THE LEVEL OF PLASMA CONSUMPTION, SHOULD TAKE A SHARP--- DOWNWARD TURN OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THE SAME SHOULD APPLY TO ALBUMIN WHICH--- HAS BEEN SYNTHESISED BY SEVERAL GENETIC ENGINEERING PROCESSES. FINALLY, ANOTHER--- PROJECT OF THE NATIONAL TRANSFUSION CENTRE IS TO MANUFACTURE AN ANTI-D IMMUNOGLOBULIN--- TO BE USED CLINICALLY TO PREVENT RHESUS IMMUNISATION.-------------------------------------------------------------- THEREFORE, OVER THE NEXT--- DECADE, THERE SHOULD BE A COMPLETE REVERSAL OF THE SITUATION REGARDING PLASMATIC--- PROTEINS. HOWEVER, THE NEED FOR RED BLOOD CELLS, AND EVEN MORE FOR LEUKOCYTES--- AND PLATELETS ARE NOWHERE NEAR TO BEING SATISFIED BY ANYTHING BUT BLOOD DONATION.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE FRENCH TRANSFUSION SYSTEM-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  PARTICULARITIES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FRENCH TRANSFUSION SYSTEM--- HAS SOME DISTINCTIVE ETHICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL FEATURES. AFTER A SHORT PERIOD--- OF TIME AFTER THE WAR WHEN DONORS RECEIVED FINANCIAL COMPENSATION, PARTLY JUSTIFIED--- BY THE NEED TO TRAVEL URGENTLY DEMANDED BY THE DIRECT TRANSFUSION METHOD, VOLUNTARY--- DONATION BECAME THE RULE. DEFERRED TRANSFUSION MADE POSSIBLE BY TECHNIQUES TO--- PRESERVE BLOOD HELPED TO ACHIEVE THIS, AND ALSO ANONYMITY.------------------------------------------------------------------- DONATION FREE OF CHARGE--- INTRODUCED BY THE PIONEERS OF TRANSFUSION, BOTH MEDICAL STAFF AND DONORS, LATER--- INFLUENCED THE WHOLE ORGANISATION OF THE TRANSFUSION SYSTEM.------------------------------------------------------------------- IN 1952, A LAW WAS PASSED--- SETTING UP THE TRANSFUSION SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES DEPARTMENTAL CENTRES (ONE FOR--- EACH---- D------- PARTEMENT---- (FRENCH ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS), REGIONAL CENTRES--- (A TOTAL OF 16) AND THE NATIONAL CENTRE WHICH ALSO TAKES ON CERTAIN SPECIAL--- TASKS IN EDUCATION AND RESEARCH.------------------------------------------------------------------- SOME REGIONAL CENTRES AND---, OF COURSE, THE NATIONAL CENTRE, HAVE DEVELOPED INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE--- FRACTIONATION OF PLASMA (A TOTAL OF 7 CENTRES).------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS SYSTEM HAS THE MONOPOLY--- OF COLLECTING, PREPARING, AND DISTRIBUTING BLOOD AND ALL ITS DERIVATIVES. AS--- A LOGICAL FOLLOW-UP TO NON LUCRATIVE DONATION, NON PROFIT MAKING IS MANDATORY.--- THIS IS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE SETTING OF A "DISPOSAL" PRICE (AND NOT A SALES--- PRICE) FOR EACH OF THE PRODUCTS, BY THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT IN CHARGE.------------------------------------------------------------------- IN THIS WAY, ALTHOUGH THE--- CENTRES DO NOT ALL HAVE THE SAME LEGAL STATUS (SOME ARE HOSPITAL-BASED OR COMMUNITY-BASED---, AND IN SOME CASES THEY ARE ASSOCIATIONS) BUT ALL TOGETHER RENDER A PUBLIC SERVICE.---------------------------------------------------------------------- ANOTHER SPECIAL FEATURE--- OF THE FRENCH SYSTEM IS THE ROLE PLAYED BY DONORS. THEY ARE-MEMBERS OF ASSOCIATIONS--- WHICH GROUP TOGETHER AT NATIONAL-LEVEL TO FORM THE FRENCH FEDERATION OF VOLUNTARY--- BLOOD DONORS (F------- D------- RATION FRAN------- AISE DES DONNEURS DE SANG--- B------- N------- VOLES). DONOR ASSOCIATIONS AT COMMUNITY LEVEL AND THE FEDERATION--- AT NATIONAL LEVEL COOPERATE WITH BLOOD TRANSFUSION ESTABLISHMENTS, SPECIALLY--- FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROMOTING BLOOD DONATION. THE ESTEEM AND GRATITUDE OWED TO--- THE VOLUNTARY DONOR IS APPARENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP STATUTE CONFERRED ON HIM.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EVOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE SYSTEM HAS HAD TO ADAPT--- TO THE CONSTANT INCREASE IN DEMAND.. IT NOW COLLECTS APPROXIMATELY 4 MILLION--- DONATIONS A YEAR. THIS IS ENTIRELY SUFFICIENT FOR LABILE PRODUCTS, AND ALMOST--- ENOUGH TO SATISFY DEMAND FOR STABLE PRODUCTS. FOR THE FIRST TIME, IN THE LAST--- TWO YEARS, FORTUNATELY LIMITED QUANTITIES OF PLASMA HAVE HAD TO BE IMPORTED.---------------------------------------------------------------------- ADAPTING TO THE GROWTH IN--- DEMAND HAS REQUIRED EFFORTS FROM ALL THE CENTRES, AND MORE PARTICULARLY THE--- FRACTIONATION CENTRES WHO IN RECENT YEARS HAVE DEVELOPED QUASI INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES--- TO PREPARE THE VARIOUS FRACTIONS AND PROCESS ABOUT 1 MILLION LITRES OF PLASMA--- A YEAR. YIELD EFFICIENCIES (EXTRACTION RATE OF THE VARIOUS PROTEINS) HAVE BEEN--- IMPROVED CONSTANTLY. THE BEST PERFORMANCES ARE ON A PAR WITH STATE OF THE ART--- TECHNOLOGY. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT IF ALL THE FRACTIONATION CENTRES HAD ATTAINED--- THAT LEVEL, IMPORTS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NATIONAL BLOOD TRANSFUSION--- CENTRE HAS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN THIS EVOLUTION. ITS EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES--- IN TRANSFUSION (MOST TRANSFUSION SPECIALISTS ARE TRAINED THERE), AND RESEARCH--- ACTIVITIES (WORK CONDUCTED BY PROFESSOR SALMON ENJOYS INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION---) ARE WORTHY OF NOTE. THE GREATEST EFFORT HOWEVER HAS BEEN IN THE FIELD OF PLASMA--- FRACTIONATION AND A POWERFUL INDUSTRIAL TOOL IS IN THE MAKING.------------------------------------------------------------------- WISHING TO MAKE THE BEST--- USE OF THIS INDUSTRIAL CAPACITY, THE MANAGEMENT HAVE CREATED IN THE PAST TWO--- YEARS A JOINT STOCK COMPANY GROUPING A NETWORK OF COMMERCIAL SUBSIDIARIES, CALLED------- ESPACE VIE---- .------------------------------------------------------------------- THE CREATION OF---- ESPACE--- VIE---- HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS NECESSARY TO ADAPT TO PHARMACEUTICAL STATUS DEVELOPMENTS--- WHICH ARE SAID TO BE INEVITABLE IN THE LIGHT OF EUROPEAN REGULATIONS WHICH WILL--- BE STUDIED BELOW.------------------------------------------------------------------- THERE IS NO DENYING, HOWEVER---, THAT CREATING A GROUP OF COMMERCIAL SUBSIDIARIES COULD RISK GRAVELY TARNISHING--- THE ALTRUISTIC IMAGE OF THE TRANSFUSION SYSTEM. THERE IS A POTENTIAL SOURCE--- OF FLAGRANT CONTRADICTION OF THE NON-PROFIT PRINCIPLE OF AN ORGANISATION WHICH--- MUST BE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO THE SOLE INTERESTS OF THE PATIENT AND RESPECT FOR--- THE SPIRIT OF GENEROSITY OF WHICH THE FIRST EXAMPLE IS SET BY DONORS.------------------------------------------------------------------- DONOR ASSOCIATIONS AND QUITE--- A FEW PHYSICIANS WORKING IN THE TRANSFUSION CENTRES DID NOT ENTIRELY APPROVE--- THE MOVE. FURTHERMORE, EXCESSIVE FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS COMPROMISED THE ECONOMIC--- BALANCE OF THE NATIONAL CENTRE.------------------------------------------------------------------- THE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES--- IN CHARGE OF THE CENTRES, BECAME AWARE OF THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OF THE MOVE--- AND ARE STUDYING THE MATTER IN PREPARATION FOR FURTHER ACTION.------------------------------------------------------------------- IT IS CLEAR THAT THE STUDY--- MUST CONSIDER MAINLY THE NATIONAL BLOOD TRANSFUSION CENTRE BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE--- IN ITS STRUCTURES, BUT MUST ALSO EXTEND TO A CONSIDERATION OF THE WHOLE FRENCH--- TRANSFUSION SYSTEM PARTICULARLY-IN THE LIGHT OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN--- DIRECTIVE ON BLOOD AND DERIVATIVES.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE ON BLOOD AND ITS-CONSEQUENCES-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE COUNCIL OF EUROPEAN--- COMMUNITIES APPROVED DIRECTIVE N  89-381 ON 14TH JUNE 1989, "SETTING UP SPECIAL--- ARRANGEMENTS FOR MEDICATION DERIVED FROM HUMAN BLOOD AND PLASMA".------------------------------------------------------------------- THE ESSENTIAL POINT IN THIS--- DIRECTIVE IS THAT IT CONFERS THE STATUS OF MEDICINAL ITEMS TO PLASMA DERIVATIVES.--- IT HOPES THAT STATES WILL ACHIEVE SELF-SUFFICIENCY USING NON PAID DONORS, BUT--- IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT PAID PLASMA FROM BEING IMPORTED, IT DOES NOT DEMAND NON-PROFIT--- STATUS FOR THE FRACTIONATION FACILITIES WHICH MAY BE PART OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR---, AND IT PROVIDES FOR COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRODUCTS.------------------------------------------------------------------- THE ECONOMIC INSPIRATION--- OF THIS DIRECTIVE WHICH AIMS TO ALLOW-FREE CIRCULATION AND-PRODUCTION OF "MEDICATION ---DERIVED FROM-HUMAN BLOOD AND PLASMA" OUTRANKS VERY CLEARLY ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS--- WHICH TAKE SECOND PLACE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------IF THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE- IS IMPLEMENTED, THERE WOULD BE SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS ON:----------------------------------------------------------------------  ETHICS,---------------------------------------------------------------  THE PRESENT TRANSFUSION--- SYSTEM,---------------------------------------------------------------  PUBLIC HEALTH,---------------------------------------------------------------  SOCIETY.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ETHICAL REPERCUSSIONS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACCEPTING THE POSSIBILITY--- OF BUYING BLOOD AND PLASMA AS A "RAW MATERIAL", AND COMMERCIAL SALE OF PROCESSED--- PRODUCTS, IS ABOVE ALL, A DENIAL OF A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM---, I.E. REFRAINING FROM MAKING COMMERCIAL USE OF THE HUMAN BODY.------------------------------------------------------------------- QUITE RECENTLY, OUR COMMITTEE---, WHEN IT PRESENTED THE INITIAL WORK OF THE GROUP "ETHICS AND MONEY" RECALLED--- OUR ATTACHMENT TO THIS PRINCIPLE :--------------------------------------------------------------- "WHEN IT IS SAID THAT THE- HUMAN BODY IS NOT FOR SALE AND NOT ON THE MARKET, THE TWO STATEMENTS ARE COMPLEMENTARY- : ON THE ONE HAND, THE HUMAN BODY OR ONE OF ITS COMPONENTS CANNOT BE THE OBJECT- OF A CONTRACT, ONE THE OTHER HAND, IT CANNOT BE NEGOTIATED BY ANYONE".-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ANY CONCESSION, ON THE--- PRETEXT THAT BLOOD IS A RENEWABLE TISSUE AND THAT LIMITED DONATION CANNOT BE--- HARMFUL, WOULD TRANSGRESS THE RULE WHICH ENSURES THAT HUMAN DIGNITY IS RESPECTED.--- ONCE BLOOD HAS BECOME A COMMERCIAL ITEM, ALL OTHER TISSUES AND ORGANS COULD--- GO THE SAME WAY.------------------------------------------------------------------- WE POINT OUT THAT OUR REFUSAL--- SHOULD START WITH THE REJECTION OF WORDING SUCH AS--- " RAW MATERIAL---- " TO--- DESIGNATE BLOOD AND PLASMA, AND--- " MEDICATION---- " TO DESCRIBE PRODUCTS PREPARED--- BY PROCESSING BLOOD AND PLASMA.------------------------------------------------------------------- THE TERMINOLOGY, WHICH IS--- IN ITSELF ALIENATING, OPENS THE WAY TO A DEVIATION OF CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES---, AND PRACTICES.-------------------------------------------------------------- HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO ENSURE--- MAXIMUM SAFETY, IT IS ADVISABLE THAT ALL THE GUARANTEES WHICH ATTACH TO THE--- STATUS OF PHARMACEUTICAL ITEMS SHOULD BE STRICTLY APPLIED TO BLOOD DERIVATIVES---, WHICH DOES NOT HOWEVER CONFER ON THEM THE STATUS OF MEDICATION AS SUCH.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PRESENT TRANSFUSION SYSTEM------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FRENCH TRANSFUSION SYSTEM--- IS BASED ON A LAW PASSED IN 1952 WHICH SET UP A CO-ORDINATED SET OF DEPARTMENTAL---, REGIONAL, AND NATIONAL CENTRES.-------------------------------------------------------------- TOGETHER, THEY RENDER A--- PUBLIC SERVICE TO WHICH WAS GIVEN THE MONOPOLY FOR COLLECTING BLOOD, PREPARING--- DERIVATIVES, AND DISTRIBUTING BLOOD AND COMPONENTS.------------------------------------------------------------------- IF THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE--- IS IMPLEMENTED, THIS SYSTEM WILL FACE THREEFOLD COMPETITION FROM THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL--- COMPANIES :------------------------------------------------------------------- THE COMPANIES COULD SET--- UP FRACTIONATION UNITS IN FRANCE,-------------------------------------------------------------- THEY COULD BUY PLASMA ABROAD---, AT A LOWER COST PRICE THAN DONATED PLASMA,-------------------------------------------------------------- THEY COULD, EITHER THROUGH--- THESE UNITS, OR THROUGH THEIR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ABROAD, MARKET LOWER--- PRICED PRODUCTS FOR TWO REASONS. FIRSTLY, BECAUSE OF THE LOWER COST OF THE PLASMA---, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BEAR THE COST OF SUPPLYING THE LABILE FRACTIONS.--- COMMERCIAL FIRMS CONCENTRATE ON THE SOLE PROFITABLE SIDE OF THE BUSINESS, I.E.--- STABLE PRODUCTS. THE LABILE SECTOR IS MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AND TO RUN PROFITABLY.--- IT WOULD REMAIN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NATIONAL TRANSFUSION SYSTEM, THEREBY--- INCREASING THE DEFICIT. BUT THE MOST THREATENING OUTCOME CONCERNS VOLUNTARY--- DONORS WHO WOULD CEASE TO FEEL CONCERNED IF THE PRINCIPLE OF VOLUNTARY DONATION--- WAS DROPPED. THEY HAVE MADE THIS SENTIMENT KNOWN THROUGH THEIR ASSOCIATIONS.---------------------------------------------------------------------- ALTOGETHER, THE ENTIRE TRANSFUSION--- SYSTEM AS IT IS TODAY WOULD VERY SOON BE ENDANGERED AND MADE INCAPABLE OF PERFORMING--- A TASK-WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH.-------------------------------------------------------------- A REORGANISATION OF STRUCTURES--- IS NECESSARY BUT MUST CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON A RENEWED ASSERTION OF ETHICAL--- PRINCIPLES, AND MUST ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE OBJECTIVES : SAFE COLLECTION--- AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS, SOBER AND REASONABLE ECONOMIC USE, CAPACITY TO--- FINANCE RESEARCH AND INVESTMENTS. THESE PRINCIPLES ENTAIL TOTAL TRANSPARENCY--- AND STRICT SUPERVISION OF THE USE OF FUNDS FOR SCIENTIFIC WORK AND FOR DAY TO--- DAY OPERATIONS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ CONSEQUENCES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACCEPTING THAT BLOOD AND--- PLASMA CAN BE BOUGHT HAS FURTHER DETRIMENTAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH.--- IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IN SUCH TRANSACTIONS, THERE IS A TENDENCY TO OVERSTEP THE--- LIMITS FOR VOLUMES DRAWN WHICH HAVE BEEN THE RULE FOR THE SAKE OF THE DONOR'S--- HEALTH. BOTH THE COLLECTING AGENCY AND THE DONOR MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH--- ABUSES.-------------------------------------------------------------- ALSO, THE PURCHASE OF BLOOD--- INCREASES POSSIBLE RISKS OF CONTAMINATION EITHER BY INFECTIOUS AGENTS, OR BY--- DRUGS, IN TWO WAYS : THERE IS A HIGHER REPRESENTATION OF THE MORE DEPRIVED SECTORS--- OF THE POPULATION WHO ARE MORE EXPOSED TO RISKS OF CONTAMINATION OF VARIOUS--- KINDS, AND VENDORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CONCEAL RISK FACTORS.------------------------------------------------------------------- FINALLY, IN A SYSTEM ENTIRELY--- GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE MARKET, CONSUMPTION MIGHT BE ENCOURAGED EVEN FOR--- MARGINAL OR ABERRANT INDICATIONS. ON THE CONTRARY, THE UNPAID CHARACTER OF THE--- DONATION OBLIGES COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION AGENTS NOT JUST TO RESPECT THE--- NON-PROFITABLE NATURE OF THE OPERATION, BUT ALSO SOBER AND REASONABLE USE, WITH--- A VERIFICATION OF INDICATIONS, AND A LIMITATION, INSOFAR AS IS POSSIBLE, OF--- THE CONSUMPTION OF BLOOD PRODUCTS WHICH CAN BE OF IMMENSE THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT---, BUT NEVERTHELESS IS NOT DEVOID OF SERIOUS RISK.------------------------------------------------------------------- WE RECOGNISE THAT THE EUROPEAN--- DIRECTIVE, BY DEMANDING THERAPEUTIC DRUG STATUS WHICH IMPLIES SAFEGUARDS, AND--- IN PARTICULAR CHECKS AND TRIALS BEFORE A PRODUCT IS PUT ON THE MARKET, SEEKS--- TO GIVE MAXIMUM PROTECTION. HOWEVER, AS WE HAVE ALREADY STATED, IT SHOULD BE--- POSSIBLE TO DEMAND IDENTICAL SAFEGUARDS WITHOUT GIVING MEDICATION STATUS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A FREE GIFT IS PART OF A--- SOCIAL CONCEPT OF SOLIDARITY WHICH IS ALL THE MORE UNSELFISH BECAUSE THE GIFT--- IS ANONYMOUS. THE COLLECTING AGENCY, RESPONSIBLE FOR NON-PROFITABILITY AND CONSCIENTIOUS--- USE, IS THE PUBLIC MEDIUM FOR THIS NOTION OF MUTUAL HELP AND THE RECIPIENT IS--- AWARE OF THE PRICELESS VALUE OF WHAT HE HAS BEEN GIVEN.------------------------------------------------------------------- IN THIS WAY, THE TRANSFUSION--- SYSTEM, AS IT WAS DESIGNED IN FRANCE, IS A CREATOR OF SOCIAL BONDS. A "MARKET---" SYSTEM CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE SUCH WHOLESOME RESULTS. ON THE CONTRARY---, IT WOULD CREATE INEQUALITIES AND IN PARTICULAR INCITE PREFERENTIAL REMOVAL OF--- SUBSTANCE FROM THE MORE DEPRIVED SECTION OF THE POPULATION.-------------------------------------------------------------------- THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE--- APPEARS TO BE INSPIRED ABOVE ALL BY ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS TO PROMOTE FREE--- TRADE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, BUT BRINGS WITH IT, IN EXCHANGE FOR VERY LIMITED--- SAFEGUARDING IMPROVEMENTS, SO MANY RISKS FOR THE PURITY OF THE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES--- INVOLVED AND THE POTENCY OF OUR TRANSFUSION-SYSTEM THAT ONE MAY LEGITIMATELY--- WONDER WHETHER IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH ETHICAL PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE REASSERTED--- ABOVE.------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS QUESTIONING OF THE--- MEDICATION STATUS COULD FOR THAT MATTER BE TO SOME EXTENT JUSTIFIED BY A SIMILAR--- TREND IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTHOUGH FOR VERY DIFFERENT MOTIVES. AT THE REQUEST--- OF THE COMMERCIAL COMPANIES THEMSELVES, THE MEDICATION STATUS IS ABOUT TO BE--- DROPPED. THE REASON IS THAT THE STATUS IMPLIES A DEGREE OF SECURITY WHICH CANNOT--- NOW, AND PROBABLY NOT IN THE FUTURE, BE TOTALLY GUARANTEED. THUS, LIABILITY----FOR RISKS WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO FORESEE-AND ESTIMATE ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY--- TROUBLESOME TO INSURE. FOR THOSE REASONS, IN THE UNITED STATES THE NOTION OF--- "SERVICE" IS REINSTATED FOR TRANSFUSION, IMPLYING FOR THE MANUFACTURER SIMPLY--- AN OBLIGATION TO USE ADEQUATE MEANS AND APPROVED PRACTICES.-------------------------------------------------------------- IT WOULD BE PARADOXICAL--- IF EUROPE WHERE TO ADOPT A SOLUTION WHICH IS CONTRARY TO ITS ETHICAL PRINCIPLES--- AND WHICH EVEN IN PURELY ECONOMIC TERMS, IS HIGHLY RISKY.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
