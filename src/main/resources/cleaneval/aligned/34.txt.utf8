GRANDMA-ILONA RICHARDSON, COEUR D'ALENE, IDAHO---- ILONA RICHARDSON (COEUR D'ALENE, ID 83815) HRICHARDSON@ISPWEST.COM--------------- MICHELLE WAS AN INSPIRATION TO ME. SHE NEVER GAVE UP HOPE IN HER BATTLE, SHE ALWAYS HAD HER SENSE OF HUMOR AND MADE THE-BEST OF THE SITUATION.. I CAME IN CONTACT WITH MICHELLE LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH A COLONOSCOPY TO RULE OUT COLON CANCER. I WAS VERY SCARED--BEING ONLY 23 AND HAVING GONE THROUGH THIS AT A YOUNG AGE, SHE WAS ABLE TO RELATE TO THE ANXIETY AND FEAR I WAS EXPERIENCING. SHE GAVE ME HOPE AND COURAGE NO MATTER WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULD BE. THANKFULLY, I WAS CLEAR, BUT LATER THAT YEAR I LOST MY GRANDMOTHER AND MY GRANDFATHER BOTH TO CANCER. THEY WERE BOTH ONLY IN THEIR 60'S AND THEY RAISED ME,-SO THIS-WAS LIKE LOSING MY PARENTS. HER WORDS GAVE ME STRENGTH, AND HER STORY-INSPIRED ME TO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY DAY AND TO LIVE MY LIFE TO THE FULLEST. I WILL TRULY MISS MICHELLE AND MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO HER GRIEVING FAMILY AS I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH. MAY THEY FIND SOME PEACE IN KNOWING MICHELLE IS NO LONGER SUFFERING.---- KATE SHANDELSON (SAUGUS, CA) AUTOMATON@MINDSPRING.COM-------------- TO THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF MICHELLE, WE ARE SADDENED TO HEAR OF MICHELLE'S PASSING.

I FOUND HER SITE WHEN I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED & EVERYTHING SHE WENT THROUGH AT FIRST WAS IDENTICAL TO WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH. SHE HELPED ME SO MUCH WHEN I THOUGHT I COULDN'T GET THROUGH THIS. SHE WOULD E-MAIL WHEN I WAS DOWN & GIVE ME ENCOURAGEMENT. SHE GAVE ME SUCH HOPE & NOW I AM JUST TOTALLY DEVASTATED. I FEEL SO BAD THAT I JUST FOUND OUT NOW. I JUST WANT HER FAMILY TO KNOW THAT I PRAYED FOR HER DAILY & THAT YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD & WERE SO LUCKY TO HAVE HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL & BEAUTIFUL ANGEL IN YOUR LIFE. I KNOW THAT SHE IS LOOKING DOWN ON ALL OF US THAT SHE HELPED & LOVED & SHE WILL-CONTINUE TO HELP US. MY HEART IS HURTING-SO MUCH RIGHT NOW.
