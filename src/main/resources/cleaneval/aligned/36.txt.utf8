WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD---- THEY----- "INVEST-----" THE OVERPAYMENT WHILE IT'S AVAILABLE; WHEN TIMES ARE BAD THEY NEED---- THE OVERPAYMENT FOR----- "SAFETY NETS-----" AND----- "UNMET NEEDS.-----" THEN THEY COME---- BACK FOR MORE.---------------------- BUT NOTE THE---------------- BIG ERROR---- BY THE REPORTER WHEN SHE STATES:--------- "IF CELLUCCI'S-PITCH TO REDUCE THE INCOME TAX RATE IN STAGES FROM 5.95 PERCENT TO---- 5 PERCENT IS SUCCESSFUL, IT COULD TAKE $-.- BILLION OUT OF THE COFFERS IN JUST THE FIRST---- YEAR...----------------------------" THIS IS AN INACCURATE STATEMENT. GOV. CELLUCCI'S PLAN WOULD PHASE IN HIS TAX RATE---- REDUCTION OVER THREE YEARS; WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED, IN THE THIRD YEAR, IT WOULD REDUCE---- REVENUE BY ABOUT $1.2 BILLION.---------------------- REGARDLESS, WHEN THE POLS TOOK THE MONEY FROM US WITH THEIR----- "TEMPORARY---------" RATE INCREASE, DID ANYONE ASK IF YOU COULD AFFORD IT, OR-WHETHER YOU'D RATHER IF THEY---- PHASED IT IN GRADUALLY OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS?---------------------- AND WHAT'S THIS----- "TAKE $1.2 BILLION OUT OF THE COFFERS-----"?---- IT SHOULDN'T---- STILL BE GOING INTO THE COFFERS---------------------------!

AGENDAS-------- BLOSSOMED. SPENDING BECAME THE ORDER OF THE DAY.--------------------------------------- GOVERNOR PAUL CELLUCCI PRODUCED THE LARGEST BUDGET EVER FILED IN-------- MASSACHUSETTS HISTORY CONTAINING PLANS TO LOWER THE INCOME TAX RATE AND HEAP MILLIONS OF-------- DOLLARS ON PET PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS. WEEKS LATER HE SAID HE WANTED TO SPEND ANOTHER-------- $300 MILLION FROM A PROJECTED STATE SURPLUS ON ONE-TIME ROAD AND BRIDGE IMPROVEMENTS.--------------------------------------- EVEN BEFORE CELLUCCI GOT THE SPENDING BUG, SPEAKER THOMAS M. FINNERAN-------- UNVEILED AN AMBITIOUS AND EXPENSIVE PLAN TO OFFER PUBLIC PRESCHOOL AND FULL-DAY-------- KINDERGARTEN. AND SENATE PRESIDENT-THOMAS F. BIRMINGHAM-CITED THE SURGING ECONOMY AS A-------- REASON TO SHARPLY INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE.--------------------------------------- DESPITE THE SPENDING EUPHORIA, ECONOMISTS ARE STILL NERVOUS ABOUT THE-------- NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE. THEY SAY FEWER JOBS WILL BE CREATED. THE FINANCIAL SERVICE SECTOR-------- COULD BE HIT BY A STOCK MARKET CRASH. AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE MAY WANE.-------------------------------------------- "ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO SLOW IN '-------------99," SAYS NICHOLAS PERNA, CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR FLEET FINANCIAL GROUP.----- "IT DOESN'T HAVE TO-------- GO DOWN THE TUBES LIKE IT DID A DECADE AGO.... A RECESSION IS UNLIKELY AND MASSACHUSETTS-------- WOULDN'T DO ANY WORSE THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF JOB LOSS AND HOW LONG IT-------- STAYED DOWN, BUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A SLOWDOWN YET MEANS PEOPLE SHOULD BE MORE-------- CAUTIOUS, NOT LESS CAUTIOUS.--------------------------------------------" WHILE CELLUCCI'S BUDGET MESSAGE FOR NEXT YEAR IS FILLED WITH WARNINGS-------- ABOUT----- "PROFLIGATE SPENDING-----" AND REMINDERS----- "OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN-------- GOVERNMENT GETS CAUGHT UP IN THE EUPHORIA THAT PREVAILS DURING A ROBUST ECONOMY,-----" HIS-------- RECORD $20.4 BILLION SPENDING PLAN REPRESENTS A 5 PERCENT BOOST OVER FISCAL 1999, GIVING-------- ACROSS-THE-BOARD INCREASES TO DOZENS OF AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS.--------------------------------------- THE MASSACHUSETTS TAXPAYERS FOUNDATION, A FISCAL WATCHDOG GROUP--------, ISSUED TWO REPORTS LAST MONTH,--------- "REACHING THE BREAKING POINT: THE COMMONWEALTH'S-------- CAPITAL DILEMMA----------" AND--------- "BUDGET '99: CONTAINING THE EUPHORIA------------------," BOTH FLAGGING THE POTENTIAL FOR A CRISIS.-------------------------------------------- "WE'RE STILL PHASING IN LAST YEAR'S TAX CUTS. THE ECONOMY HAS-------- ALREADY OUTPERFORMED EVERYONE'S EXPECTATION FOR MUCH LONGER THAN ANYONE ANTICIPATED. THIS-------- CLEARLY CAN'T GO ON FOREVER AND THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS,-----" SAID MICHAEL WIDMER--------, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE TAXPAYERS FOUNDATION.--------------------------------------- HE POINTS TO THE SO-CALLED BUDGET BUSTERS -- FUNDING FOR THE MBTA--------, HEALTH CARE FOR STATE EMPLOYEES, AND MEDICAID -- CLIMBING TO UNFORESEEN LEVELS.-------------------------------------------- "THE BUDGET IS EXPLODING,-----" WIDMER ADDED.----- "AT THE SAME-------- TIME, WE HAVE THIS HUGE PROBLEM OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY ENOUGH CAPITAL RESOURCES TO INVEST-------- IN A LONG LIST OF IMPORTANT PRIORITIES WHILE PAYING FOR THE CENTRAL ARTERY.--------------------------------------------" LAST WEEK, CELLUCCI SAID HE WOULD POUR MUCH OF THE STATE'S CASH-------- SURPLUS INTO ONE-TIME HIGHWAY AND BRIDGE PROJECTS, TAKING SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF THE-------- CAPITAL BUDGET.--------------------------------------- BUT SUCH A SPENDING LUXURY COULD BE SHORT-LIVED.--------------------------------------- THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE -- ROADS, BUILDINGS, BRIDGES, PIPES, ETC.-------- -- IS AMONG THE OLDEST IN THE NATION AND COULD EASILY SIPHON MILLIONS OUT OF THE GENERAL-------- FUND FOR NEEDED REPAIRS OVER THE--------------- NEXT---- FEW YEARS. IF CELLUCCI'S PITCH TO-------- REDUCE THE INCOME TAX RATE IN STAGES-FROM 5.95 PERCENT TO 5 PERCENT IS SUCCESSFUL, IT-------- COULD TAKE $1.--BILLION OUT OF THE COFFERS IN JUST THE FIRST YEAR-------------------------- [SIC--------------------], POSSIBLY ELIMINATING ANY SURPLUS, THEREBY STRETCHING THE CAPITAL BUDGET THINNER.----------------------------------------FREDERICK BREIMYER, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT-STATE STREET BANK WHO BELIEVES-------- THE STATE'S SOARING TIMES ARE IN FOR A----- "SOFT LANDING,-----" SAID IT IS EVIDENT THAT-------- POLITICIANS ARE STRUGGLING TO DETERMINE HOW TO SPEND THIS YEAR'S CASH WITHOUT PERMANENTLY-------- ELEVATING EXPECTATIONS.-------------------------------------------- "GROWTH IS LIKELY TO DIMINISH,-----" BREIMYER SAID.----- "THE-------- POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT HERE IS TRYING TO FIND A MIDDLE LINE. I THINK THEY'VE DONE A-------- REASONABLY GOOD JOB. THERE HAS BEEN A SENSE OF PRUDENCE. AND I THINK PRUDENCE IS-------- WARRANTED.--------------------------------------------" HOWEVER, CITIES AND TOWNS, WHICH HAVE RECEIVED LOCAL AID INCREASES-------- EACH OF THE LAST EIGHT YEARS -- A 113 PERCENT OVERALL JUMP IN SPENDING SINCE 1992 -- ARE-------- ALREADY CLAMORING FOR MORE THAN THE $4.5 BILLION CELLUCCI IS OFFERING FOR NEXT YEAR.--------------------------------------- HOLYOKE MAYOR DANIEL SZOSTKIEWICZ SAYS MAJOR LOCAL AID INCREASES OVER-------- THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAVE FUELED A RENAISSANCE IN HIS CITY, LURING YOUNG FAMILIES BACK WHO-------- ONCE WOULD HAVE SHUNNED THE SHABBY SCHOOLS, WHICH NOW HAVE NEW BOOKS AND ARE WIRED FOR THE-------- INTERNET.-------------------------------------------- "IT WAS GREAT. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL,-----" SZOSTKIEWICZ.------------- "BUT WHEN YOU GO FROM MULTIMILLION DOLLAR INCREASES TO LEVEL FUNDING, IT FEELS LIKE-------- YOU'RE JUST HITTING A WALL.--------------------------------------------" OF COURSE, HE IS ALREADY TALKING ABOUT----- "WORKING THE-------- LEGISLATURE-----" ON GETTING MORE THAN THE--60 MILLION HOLYOKE IS ALREADY PROMISED.--------------------------------------- ALL THIS FRUSTRATES THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.-------------------------------------------- "YOU CAN'T OPEN THE PIGGY BANK FOR EVERYONE ALL THE TIME-------------," SAID CELLUCCI SPOKESWOMAN ILENE HOFFER.----- "YOU HAVE TO IMPOSE CONTROLS. THE MOST-------- CRITICAL WAY TO DO THAT IS TO TAKE MONEY OFF THE TABLE BY REDUCING THE INCOME TAX.--------------------------------------------" WILL-THE LEGISLATURE APPROVE THE RATE CUT?--------------------------------------- SENATE PRESIDENT-BIRMINGHAM HOPES NOT.-------------------------------------------- "I'M NOT NOSTRADAMUS,-----" HE SAID.----- "AND I DON'T KNOW IF-------- THE GOVERNOR HAS NOSTRADAMUS ADVISING HIM. I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE ECONOMY WILL SLOW DOWN-------- ... AND FOR THAT REASON I TAKE-A CAUTIOUS APPROACH.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
