PAINFUL BECAUSE THE MIDDLE FINGER OF MY LEFT HAND------------- IS FRACTURED. BROKEN ON DECEMBER 26 BY KONOIKE SECURITY GUARDS NEAR------------- THE SONDU-MIRIU HYDROPOWER PROJECT IN NYANZA, KENYA. THIS FRACTURE------------- WAS MADE WORSE BY KENYA POLICE WHO TORTURED ME. IT WAS THEN AGGRAVATED------------- BY FELLOW HARDCORE INMATES WHO BEAT ME ON ORDERS FROM THE POLICE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MY LEFT SHOULDER ACHES. THE OUTCOME------------- OF A BULLET GRAZE THAT WAS AIMED FOR MY HEAD BY KENYA POLICE ON THE------------- SAME DATE. IT WAS MEANT TO BE FATAL, I WAS TOLD BY POLICE COMMANDER------------- KOLA OF AHERO POLICE STATION.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HE TOLD ME:- MY ORDERS WERE TO SHOOT------------- YOU DEAD. I WOULD HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER. THEN I WOULD HAVE------------- SPENT SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON. I WAS GOING TO COME OUT DEFINITELY. BUT------------- WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE COME OUT OF YOUR GRAVE?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT? PERHAPS I------------- HAVE PUT THE PROVERBIAL CART BEFORE THE HORSE. I INTRODUCE MYSELF.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MY NAME IS ARGWINGS ODERA. I AM THE------------- PERSON CO-ORDINATING THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN IN NYANZA AND EFFORTS------------- TO SAVE THE SONDU-MIRIU RIVER FROM THE OVERWHELMING NEGATIVE IMPACTS------------- OF A 80 MW HYDROPOWER PROJECT INITIATED IN------ THIS IS A PROJECT------------- FUNDED BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT. OVER 200,000 PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED------------- NEGATIVELY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I AM BEING------------- ARRESTED BECAUSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES AT THE PROJECT. WE WERE FIRST ARRESTED------------- AND DETAINED FOR TWO DAYS SOMETIMES IN NOVEMBER------ THEN WE WERE------------- ARRESTED AGAIN, WITH ABOUT 20 OTHERS, ON FEBRUARY 28, 2000, DETAINED------------- FOR A DAY AT AHERO POLICE STATION AND RELEASED WITHOUT CHARGE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT DID I DO THIS TIME ROUND? MINE------------- WAS A CASE OF SHOOT THE MESSENGER-BEFORE HE DELIVERS THE NEWS. MY------------- COLLEAGUES AND I HAD HELD A MEETING ON DECEMBER----WITH THE COUNTRY------------- REPRESENTATIVE OF JBIC IN HIS NAIROBI OFFICES. WE OUTLINED THE PROBLEMS------------- OF SONDU-MIRIU. THE REPRESENTATIVE LISTENED TO US FOR TWO HOURS. THEN------------- HE SPOKE FOR THIRTY MINUTES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AMONG THE THINGS HE SAID WAS THAT------------- WE GO TO SONDU AND INFORM THE AFFECTED COMMUNITY OF AN IMPENDING MEETING------------- WITH TOP JAPANESE OFFICIALS. WE TOLD HIM OF OUR FEARS. HE GUARANTEED------------- THAT HE WOULD END THE HARASSMENT IN THE PROJECT AREA AND PROTECT US------------- FROM FURTHER ARRESTS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THUS IT WAS WITH JOY THAT I SET OUT------------- DECEMBER 26 TO BE THE BIDDER OF GOOD NEWS TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY.------------- I DID NOT HAVE ANY FOREBODING AS I DROVE FROM NAIROBI FOR 500 KILOMETRES------------- TO THE PROJECT AREA.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AT AROUND MIDDAY, I WAS SNAKING UP------------- THE-DUSTY ROAD TOWARDS A-NEARBY SHOPPING CENTRE CALLED APOKO. I OFFERED------------- A LIFT TO THREE VILLAGERS WHO WERE WALKING UP THE HILLY AND WINDY------------- 15 KILOMETRES TO THE SHOPPING CENTRE.-------------------------------------------------------- AT THE CENTRE, ONE OF THEM INFORMEDF------------- HE WAS GOING ACROSSD THE RIVER, ANOTHER FOUR KILOMETRES, OVER THE------------- BRIDGE BUILT BY KONOIKE. THIS BRIDGE, ACCORDING TO PROJECT DOCUMENTS-------------, WAS MEANT TO BENEFIT MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WHO DID NOT HAVE------------- TO SPEND ANY MORE MONEY ON THE FERRY OPERATORS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I WAS STOPPED AT THE BRIDGE BY SECURITY------------- GUARDS WHO TOLD ME I WAS UNWANTED IN THAT AREA AND THAT OUR PROJECT------------- VEHICLE HAD BEEN BANNED FROM USING THE ROAD. I-LEFT THE VILLAGER TO--------------WALK ACROSS THE BRIDGE. I TURNED THE VEHICLE AND WAS FLAGGED DOWN------------- BY ANOTHER VILLAGER WHO REQUESTED I TAKE HIM TO THE SHOPPING DISTRICT.------------- I OBLIGED.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE TIME WAS 12.30 PM, DECEMBER----------------- AS I DROVE BACK TOWARDS THE SHOPPING DISTRICT, ABOUT A KILOMETRE FROM------------- THE BRIDGE, A BIG GREEN GRAVEL MIXING TRUCK CAME THUNDERING TOWARDS------------- ME. ON MY LEFT WAS DEEP-DEPRESSION. WE DRIVE KEEPING LEFT. ON MY RIGHT------------- WAS A MOUNTAIN WALL. THE VEHICLE WAS STEERED DIRECTLY TOWARDS ME.------------- I STEERED RIGHT. THE LEFT SIDE OF MY CAR WAS HIT, THE SIDE MIRROR -------------CLUTTERED INTO THE-DEEP RAVINE. THERE WAS DUST ALL OVER.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ANOTHER VEHICLE, A VAN, CAME BEHIND------------- ME AND BLOCKED MY PATH.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TWO KONOIKE SECURITY GUARDS EMERGED------------- FROM THE HAZE. THEY WERE WAVING THEIR WALKIE-TALKIES MENACINGLY. I------------- IDENTIFY ONE AS CHARLES O. OGUTU AND ANOTHER AS MIKE GUNDO. I CAN------------- IDENTIFY THE REST BY SIGHT. ALL I COULD-HEAR THEM SAY WAS:- YOU ARE------------- THE INCITERS. TODAY YOU WILL SEE FIRE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THAT WAS BEFORE I SPAT OUT BLOOD WHEN------------- THE GUARDS PUNCHED ME, SECIFICALLY OGUTU, IN THE MOUTH. THE VILLAGER------------- WAS SHOCKED. HE WAS YANKED OUT OF THE CAR, BEATEN AND KICKED INTO------------- THE DEPRESSION. I ONLY SAW HIS WHITE SHIRT DISAPPEARING BENEATH ME------------- AS HE ROLLED OVER AND OVER. IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT I LOCKED MYSELF------------- IN THE CAR AND ROLLED UP-THE WINDOWS. THE KONOIKE GUARDS STONED THE------------- CAR IN A BID TO BREAK IN. THEY ONLY STOPPED WHEN THEY SAW VILLAGERS------------- APPEARING OVER THE HILLS WITH MACHETES. THEY RADIOED FOR REINFORCEMENT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AT 1.30 PM, FIVE ARMED POLICEMEN APPEARED------------- WITH A VEHICLE. I WAS-STILL SANDWICHED BETWEEN THE TWO CARS. THE POLICE------------- LEADER ORDERED ME TO OPEN THE DOORS OF THE VEHICLE. INSTEAD, I OPENED------------- A SMALL SECTION OF THE WINDOW. I HEARD OGUTU URGE HIM TO SHOOT ME------------- DEAD IN THE CAR.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SHOOT HIM C SHOOT HIM. KILL HIM.------------- HE HAS STOPPED OUR MONEY FROM COMING. KILL HIM!H THAT IS ALL I REMEMBER------------- HEARING.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I TOLD THE POLICEMEN TO LET ME KNOW------------- IF I WAS UNDER ARREST AND TO SHOW ME THE ARREST WARRANT. I TOLD HIM------------- I WAS AFRAID TO OPEN THE WINDOW FURTHER BECAUSE THE KONOIKE GUARDS------------- HAD JUST BROKEN MY FINGER, AND I DID NOT WANT THEM TO BREAK ANOTHER------------- FINGER. THE POLICEMAN STEPPED BACK AND TALKED OVER HIS WALKIE-TALKIE.------------- FOUR POLICEMEN HAD SURROUNDED THE VEHICLE WITH THEIR GUNS COCKED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I WAS DEHYDRATING FAST BECAUSE I WAS------------- CONFINED IN THE CAR UNDER THE SWELTERING TROPICAL HEAT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AT 3.30 PM, MORE POLICEMEN, ALL ARMED------------- CAME. THE NUMBER I COUNTED ROSE TO ABOUT---- THE NUMBER OF VILLAGERS------------- WAS ALSO SWELLING AS WORD SPREAD ACROSS THE VILLAGES ABOUT WHAT WAS------------- HAPPENING TO ME.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ONE POLICEMAN IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS------------- KOLA, THE AHERO POLICE COMMANDER. HE ORDERED ME TO OPEN THE DOORS------------- TO THE VEHICLE. I ASKED HIM IF I WAS UNDER ARREST. HE SAID HE JUST------------- WANTED TO HAVE A WORD WITH ME. I TOLD HIM WE COULD SPEAK THROUGH THE------------- SMALL CRACK BECAUSE MY FINGER HAD BEEN BROKEN AND I WAS AFRAID THE------------- KONOIKE GUARDS, WHO WERE HOVERING-AROUND, WOULD BREAK THE OTHER FINGERS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HE GOT ANGRY AND DECLARED I WAS UNDER------------- ARREST. HE ORDERED ME TO OPEN THE DOOR OF THE-VEHICLE. I TOLD I WOULD------------- GLADLY FOLLOW THE POLICEMEN TO THE STATION BUT-NO ARMED POLICEMAN------------- WOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENTER INSIDE THE VEHICLE AS PER OFFICE REGULATIONS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I REMEMBER HIM SAYING:- WHO DO YOU------------- THINK YOU ARE? YOU THINK YOU ARE GOLD? I WILL CALL A TOWING VEHICLE------------- AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------! THE NUMBER OF ARMED POLICEMEN, MACHINE------------- GUNS- RIFLES AND PISTOLS,-HAD SWELLED TO ABOUT---- THE NUMBER OF VILLAGERS------------- HAD ALSO INCREASED TO MORE THAN 5---PEOPLE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AT 6.45 PM THE ANGRY-VILLAGERS STARTED------------- THROWING STONES TOWARDS THE POLICEMEN WHO FLED THE SCENE. I WAS LATER------------- TOLD THE RECOVERY VEHICLE HAD JUST COME AND WAS PREPARING TO TOW MY------------- VEHICLE. I COULD NOT SEE IT BECAUSE I WAS SANDWICHED BETWEEN THE TWO------------- BIG VEHICLES. APPARENTLY THE VILLAGERS HAD VOWED THAT THE POLICE WOULD------------- NOT TAKE ME ANYWHERE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AT 7.15, DARKNESS CREPT. I AM TOLD------------- THE VILLAGERS WERE AFRAID THE POLICE WOULD USE THE COVER OF DARKNESS------------- TO HARM ME. THE VILLAGERS LIT THREE PRESSURE LANTERNS WHICH ILLUMINATED------------- THE AREA VERY WELL. THEY SETTLED FOR A NIGHT-LONG VIGIL.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AT AROUND 8.-- PM, I HEARD MOVEMENT------------- ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY CAR. THEN I HEARD INSTRUCTIONS BEING GIVEN.--------------I HEARD SOMETHING LIKE- FIRE IN THE CAR-- IF IT GETS HIM, TOO BAD-------------! FIRE THREE SHOTS THAT SIDE AND YOU FIRE---------------- THE OTHER------------- SIDE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HORRIFIED, I OPENED THE PASSENGER------------- SIDE WINDOW TO TELL THE POLICE NOT TO SHOOT AT THE VILLAGERS BECAUSE------------- I SURRENDER. THE NEXT THING I SAW WAS A BLACK FIGURE WITH AN AK--------------47 AIMED AT ME. EVERYTHING ELSE HAPPENED IN SLOW MOTION.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I COULD SEE MYSELF LAUGHING AND TELLING------------- MYSELF I WAS NOT MEANT TO DIE THIS WAY. MEANWHILE, I STARTED DROPPING------------- DOWN. THE FLOOR OF THE CAR WAS SO FAR WAY. AND THERE WAS A LOT OF------------- HEAT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MY EYES WERE CLOGGED WITH GLASS. MY------------- NOSE WAS BLEEDING, ALSO-CLOGGED WITH GLASS. THERE WAS STRONG SMELL------------- OF METAL, I GUESS GUNPOWDER. I COULD SEE MY HEAD RUSHING TOWARDS ONE------------- OF THE KONOIKE VEHICLES THAT HAD BLOCKED MY PATH, THE DOOR OPENED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I COULD SEE FIRE FLIES ALL OVER. EXCEPT------------- THIS TIME THE FLAMES WERE UGLY. THEY WERE RED AND------------------------------------------------------- SPARKING INSTEAD OF THE BEAUTIFUL------------- LIGHT YELLOW. I REMEMBER ASSURING MYSELF THAT THE VILLAGERS WOULD------------- BE SAFE. BUT I WAS-HAVING DIFFICULTY BREATHING BECAUSE I HAD BEEN------------- KICKED INTO THE FLOOR OF THE KONOIKE VAN WHICH WAS STILL CARRYING------------- MR OGUTU, THE KONOIKE SECURITY MAN. THE VEHICLE WAS BEING DRIVEN TOO------------- FAST AND SOMEBODY KEPT PUNCHING MY RIBS FROM THE BACK.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE POLICE LATER SAID THEY HAD FIRED------------- OVER 100 BULLETS WHICH I WAS TO PAY FOR.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE KONOIKE VEHICLE WAS STOPPED------------- 15 KILOMETRES FROM THE SITE OF MY ARREST. OGUTU SAID HE HAD TO KICK IN------------- TWO OF-MY TEETH. THE POLICEMEN ESCORTING ME PLEADED WITH HIM NOT TO------------- DO THAT BECAUSE THEIR BOSS KNEW THE CONDITION I WAS IN WHEN I WAS------------- ARRESTED AND THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS IF I ARRIVED IN A DIFFERENT------------- CONDITION. HE WAS PROMISED THERE WILL BE ENOUGH ROOM TO BEAT ME WHEN------------- WE REACHED THE AHERO POLICE STATION.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I LOST TRACK OF TIME AT THAT MOMENT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I WAS KICKED INTO THE POLICE STATION------------- FROM THE VAN. THERE I WAS RECEIVED WITH BLOWS AND KICKS BY A MR OTIENO-------------, THE DISTRICT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OFFICER. I WAS IMMUNE TO PAIN------------- AT THAT TIME. I COULD NOT SEE. MY HEARING WAS BAD. I HEARD HIM SAY------------- I WAS GOING TO DIE FROM MY BULLET-WOUND. THAT IS WHEN I REALISEDF------------- MY T-SHIRT WAS GLUED ON THE LEFT SIDE-OF MY BODY. IT WAS WET AND COLD.------------- BUT I COULD NOT SEE, ROLLING MY EYEBALLS WOULD CAUSE A GREAT DEAL -------------OF PAIN.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I WAS STRIPPED NAKED AND TAKEN TO------------- A ROOM WHERE I WAS TOLD THE POLICE WOULD PLANT A LETTER ON ME THAT------------- I WAS PLANNING TO BOMB THE CONSTRUCTION SITE.-OTIENO AND OTHER POLICEMEN------------- ASKED ME IF I WAS READY TO CONFESS THAT I WAS THE SONDU BOMBER. I------------- SAD NO. I WAS LASHED BUT FELT NO PAIN BECAUSE MY WHOLE BODY WAS THROBBING.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THAT IS WHEN THEY NOTICED MY BROKEN------------- FINGER. SOMEBODY GRABBED THE FINGER AND TWISTED IT DEMANDING I CONFESS.------------- NOW THERE WAS REAL PAIN. I SCREAMED. THE POLICE SAID AS A JOURNALIST-------------, I WILL NEVER TYPE AGAIN. SOMEBODY PUNCHED MY WOUNDED SHOULDER. I SCREAMED------------- AGAIN. SOMEBODY ORDERED I STOP SCREAMING AND START SINGING A POPULAR------------- LOCAL SONG TITLED MALO! MALO! (HIGHER! HIGHER!). I KNEW THE SONG THAT------------- NIGHT. I SANG WITH EVERY STAB OF PAIN ON MY SHOULDER OR FINGER. I------------- WISHED THEY COULD JUST GO ON KICKING ME AND PUNCHING ME AND LEAVE------------- THE SHOULDER AND FINGER ALONE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I HEARD OGUTU SAYING MY FUTURE WAS------------- RUINED BECAUSE HE WAS GOING BACK WITH A GROUP OF POLICE OFFICERS TO------------- SHOOT AT THE MEN AND RAPE THEIR WOMEN. THEIR BLOOD WOULD BE IN MY------------- HANDS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I THINK AT AROUND 1 AM, I WAS THROWN------------- IN JAIL. THE INMATES HAD BEEN ORDERED TO BEAT ME UP BECAUSE I WAS------------- BRINGING TROUBLE TO THE GOVERNMENT. I LANDED INTO MORE FISTS AND CLAWING------------- HANDS THE MOMENT I WAS THROWN IN JAIL. IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THE INMATES------------- NOTICED MY DISLOCATED AND BROKEN FINGER. AFRAID THEY HAD BROKEN THE------------- FINGER, FIVE OF THEM PINNED ME DOWN AS ONE YANKED THE DIGIT BACK INTO------------- PLACE. I SCREAMED. A DIRTY RAG WAS SHOVED IN MY MOUTH TO MUFFLE THE------------- SCREAM.-------------------------------------------------------- THEN THEY NOTICED MY EYEFUL OF GLASSSES.------------- I WAS PINNED DOWN AGAIN AND ANOTHER LICKED THE EYEBALLS, SPITTING------------- IN THE SLOTH BUCKET ALL THE TIME. BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT THE RAG SHOVED------------- IN MY MOUTH, I SCREAMED INWARDLY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I AM NURSING HORRIBLE THRASHES AND------------- WOUNDS ON THE LIPS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BUT I WAS GLAD FOR WHAT THEY DID.------------- THEY THEN PEELED OFF MY SHIRT TO INSPECT THE BULLET WOUND. ONE OF------------- THEM PRODUCED A COLGATE TOOTHPASTE WHICH WAS SMEARED OVER THE WOUND------------- SO THAT IT DRIES OVER THE WOUND.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THEN THEY DEMANDED TO BE TOLD WHAT------------- I HAD DONE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NEXT DAY, I WAS ORDERED TO EMPTY------------- THE FULL SLOTH BUCKET. NAKED, BARE FEET, I WALKED INTO A FILTHY TOILET-------------, NOW HALF BLIND, WHERE I EMPTIED THE SLOTH BUCKET. LATER IN THE DAY-------------, I WAS SUMMONED FROM THE CELL BLOCK. I WAS INFORMED I WAS GOING TO------------- SING AGAIN.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I SANG AMID PAIN AND TORTURE. THIS------------- TIME I SAW OTIENO, THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER, MAKING ORDERS FOR MY------------- BEATING. SUDDENLY, ALL THE POLICE STOPPED BEATING ME AND SALUTED.------------- AT THE DOOR WAS A SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER ? THE PEOPLE WHO REPORT------------- DIRECTLY TO STATE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT. I WAS TAKEN TO ANOTHER------------- ROOM WHERE THIS MAN, HE IS KIND, INTERROGATED ME FOR FOUR HOURS. HE------------- DID NOT BEAT ME. HE ASKED SUCH QUESTIONS LIKE PREFERRED SEX POSITION.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS IS ALSO THE DAY THE BEATING OFFICIALLY------------- STOPPED. THE STATION COMMANDER, KOLA, HOWEVER KEPT ON REMINDING ME------------- THAT HE WAS YET TO GIVE ME 10 STROKES OF THE CANE. MY REQUEST TO BE------------- SEEN BY A DOCTOR WERE TURNED DOWN. MY REQUEST FOR MY CLOTHES WERE------------- TURNED DOWN. I WAS ONLY GIVEN MY JEANS TROUSER.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CAME DECEMBER 28 AND WE WERE CLOSE------------- TO 100 PEOPLE IN THE CELL. WATER WAS BROUGHT IN A BUCKET TO WIPE THE------------- FLOOR. THE HARDCORE INMATES USED IT TO BATH BEFORE ASSIGNING PEOPLE------------- DUTY TO WIPE THE FLOOR OF THE LICE INFESTED JAIL.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CAME THE---- 29^TH------ AND I WAS------------- IN THE PRIVILEGED CIRCLE. I WAS ALLOWED TO BATH WITH THE DIRTY WATER------------- AND WIPE MYSELF WITH SOAP. OTHER PRISONERS MERELY LOOKED ON ENVIOUSLY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS WAS THE SAME DAY I WAS REMOVED------------- FROM AHERO IN A HIDE AND SEEK GAME BETWEEN THE POLICE AND MY LAWYER.------------- I WAS MOVED 30 KILOMETERES AWAY TO THE KISUMU JAIL, KEPT INCOMUNICADO------------- BEFORE BEING TRANSFERRED 50 KILOMETRES AWAY TO MASENO.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AGAIN I WAS DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY------------- TO SEE A DOCTOR, TO BATH OR TO SIT IN THE SUN. I SPENT---- 30^TH----------------------,- 31^ST------ AND JANUARY 1, 2000 WITH NOBODY KNOWING MY WHEREABOUTS.------------- I WAS NOT TORTURED AT MASENO. I WOULD JUST DRIFT INTO SLEEP, BACK------------- INTO WAKEFULNESS AND BACK INTO SLEEP. I LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT FOR LACK------------- OF WATER.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IT WAS THEN ON DECEMBER 2, THAT I------------- WAS PRODUCED IN COURT, INJURED, WOUNDED AND BEATEN, CHARGED WITH RESISTING------------- ARREST, INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE, TRESSPASS AND TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS AND------------- PUBLISHING FALSE INFORMATION TO JAPAN.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT LESSON DID I LEARN FROM ALL THIS------------- PUNISHMENT AS I PAINFULLY REFLECT ON WHAT HAPPENED TO ME? THAT THE------------- WILL OF THE PEOPLE OF SONDU-MIRIU SHALL PREVAIL----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
