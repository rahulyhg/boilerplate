-----THE INTERNET AND SCHOOLS: A SURVEY OF NETWORKING ACTIVITIES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MANAGER, EDUCATION MARKET DEVELOPMENT, CISCO SYSTEMS---- TPARKER@CISCO.COM---- (PRESENTED AT THE INTERNET SOCIETY'S INET '94 CONFERENCE IN PRAGUE)------- ABSTRACT----------- THIS PAPER PRESENTS A SURVEY OF SOME OF THE MAJOR- GROUPS AND ACTIVITIES THAT ARE SHAPING THE FUTURE OF THE- INTERNET'S ROLE IN EDUCATION.- IT ALSO COVERS SOME- PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT ADMINISTRATIVE, INSTRUCTIONAL-, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH- PROJECTS AND APPLICATIONS, AND SOME EXCITING CURRENT -INITIATIVES AROUND THE U.S.- FINALLY, IT DISCUSSES-SOME- OF THE BARRIERS THAT FACE SCHOOLS-IN GETTING CONNECTED TO- THE INTERNET. THE PAPER WAS WRITTEN WITH A U.S.-PERSPECTIVE.----------- I. INTRODUCTION-------- THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS -K-12 IN THE U.S., MEANING KINDERGARTEN THROUGH 12TH- GRADE) IS STARTING TO FOCUS ITS ATTENTION ON THE INTERNET.-MOST SCHOOL NETWORKING ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED IN THE- U.S., HOWEVER, THERE ARE PROJECTS BEING INITIATED IN- CANADA- JAPAN, THE UK AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THE- INTERNET IS BEING USED FOR ALL ASPECTS OF EDUCATION-, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE, EDUCATIONAL, PROFESSIONAL- DEVELOPMENT, AND COMMUNITY BUILDING.---- A RECENT INFORMAL CENSUS CONDUCTED VIA VOLUNTARY- REPORTINGS-OVER THE INTERNET ESTIMATES THE NUMBER OF- TEACHERS AND STUDENTS (INDIVIDUAL AND CLASSROOM- ACCOUNTS) IN THE U.S. USING THE INTERNET, EITHER DIRECTLY--OR INDIRECTLY, AT ALMOST----- 250,THE NUMBER OF- EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES, DATABASES, MAILING LISTS, AND- ARCHIVES IS ALSO GROWING RAPIDLY -- SO MUCH SO THAT ONE- EDUCATOR RECENTLY LAMENTED ON AN EDUCATION MAILING LIST- THERE WAS TOO MUCH AVAILABLE, THAT THE SHEER NUMBER OF- DISTRIBUTED SERVICES WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO OVERWHELM THE- NOVICE TEACHER EMBARKING FOR THE FIRST TIME ON A DIGITAL- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRIP.- (THIS PROBLEM IS BEING- ADDRESSED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF USER FRIENDLY SEARCH- AND RETRIEVAL TOOLS THAT PRESENT A SIMPLE, ORGANIZED FACE- OF THE INTERNET, SUCH AS GOPHER AND THE- WORLDWIDEWEB.----) THE STATE OF EDUCATIONAL NETWORKING IS BEING SHAPED- BY MANY GROUPS, NETWORKING INITIATIVES, PILOT PROJECTS- AND NEW CHALLENGES.- SOME OF THESE ARE OUTLINED BELOW.------- II. INTERNATIONAL GROUPS AND PROJECTS-------- SOME OF THE INTERNATIONAL DIRECTION AND EVANGELISM- FOR K12 NETWORKING IS BEING HEADED BY THE INTERNET- SOCIETY'S K-12 COMMITTEE.---- THE INTERNET SOCIETY (ISOC) IS A PROFESSIONAL- ORGANIZATION THAT IS CHARTERED TO FACILITATE AND SUPPORT- THE TECHNICAL EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNET AS A RESEARCH AND -EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE, AND TO EDUCATE THE-MEMBERS ON- ITS TECHNOLOGY, USES AND APPLICATIONS. THE ISOC'S K--12 COMMITTEE WAS FORMED ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO TO- PROMOTE THE USE OF NETWORKING IN THE CLASSROOM-, DISCUSS ISSUES RELATED TO TEACHERS AND CHILDREN ACCESSING -THE INTERNET AND TO PROPOSE CONCRETE AND USEFUL- SOLUTIONS TO BARRIERS FACING EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS.------- II.A. IETF INVOLVEMENT-------- AMONG THE MANY PROJECTS ITS MEMBERS ARE WORKING- ON, THE INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE (IETF) IS- WORKING ON SCHOOL-RELATED EFFORTS.---- FOR EXAMPLE, THE IETF'S INTERNET SCHOOL- NETWORKING (ISN) WORKING GROUP RECENTLY WROTE A- REQUEST FOR COMMENTS (RFC) FOR YOUR INFORMATION- (FYI) DOCUMENT (RFC----) CALLED "FYI ON QUESTIONS- AND ANSWERS---ANSWERS TO COMMONLY ASKED PRIMARY- AND SECONDARY SCHOOL INTERNET USER.-" THE VARIOUS- SECTIONS ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT OBTAINING AN INTERNET- CONNECTION, TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION AND TECHNICAL- OPTIONS, SECURITY AND ETHICS, EDUCATIONAL COLLABORATION-, PROJECTS AND RESOURCES.---- THIS WORKING GROUP IS CREATING OTHER USEFUL- DOCUMENTS. ONE OF THESE"K-12 INTERNETWORKING- GUIDELINES" EXPLAINS WHAT SCHOOLS NEED TO KNOW FOR- FUTURE NETWORKING PLANS.------- II. B. U.S. GROUPS AND NETWORKS-------- IN THE U.S., THERE IS THE WELL KNOWN NATIONAL- RESEARCH-AND EDUCATION NETWORK (NREN) PART OF THE- HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS- ACT OF------- THE MORE RECENT NATIONAL INFORMATION- INFRASTRUCTURE (NII) INITIATIVE, WHICH IS MUCH BROADER IN- SCALE, IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT K-12 EDUCATION IN TERMS OF- UBIQUITOUS CONNECTIVITY TO ALL SCHOOLS. INDEED-, THE- CLINTON/GORE ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY ISSUED AN- AMBITIOUS CHALLENGE CALLING FOR ALL SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES- TO BE CONNECTED TO THE NII BY THE YEAR------- MANY- BUSINESSES HAVE RESPONDED WITH PLEDGES TO MAKE THIS A- REALITY.------- II.C. THE CONSORTIUM FOR SCHOOL NETWORKING-------- THE CONSORTIUM FOR SCHOOL NETWORKING (COSN) IS- A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION OF INSTITUTIONS, COMPANIES- AND INDIVIDUALS CHARGED- WITH PROMOTING THE USE OF- COMPUTER NETWORK TECHNOLOGY IN-K--12 EDUCATION- WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. SERVICES COSN PROVIDES TO-- ITS MEMBERS INCLUDE REGULAR NEWSLETTERS ON NETWORKING- TOPICS OF INTEREST, AN EXTENSIVE ON-LINE GOPHER SERVER OF- EDUCATION NETWORKS-, PROJECTS AND RESOURCES. COSN HAS- ALSO TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS ON- BEHALF OF K--12 NETWORKING INTERESTS.---- ONE OF THE LATEST EFFORTS FROM COSN WAS A PROJECT- FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AND BEING- CONDUCTED IN COOPERATION WITH THE FEDERATION OF- AMERICAN RESEARCH NETWORKS (FARNET).---- THE PROJECT, CALLED "BUILDING CONSENSUS AND- MODELS," BROUGHT- TOGETHER REPRESENTATIVES FROM- INDUSTRY, NATIONAL, STATE AND- LOCAL LEVELS.-- FIVE GROUPS- FORMED, EACH CHARGED WITH LAYING- OUT THE KEY- REQUIREMENTS AND PROPOSED MODELS FOR A CERTAIN TOPIC.-THE TOPICS AND MODELS INCLUDED EDUCATIONAL REFORM AND-- RESTRUCTURING FOR A TECHNOLOGY-INTENSIVE SOCIETY;- CONNECTIVITY- AND ACCESS; TECHNICAL AND USER SUPPORT;- FINANCIAL; AND CURRICULUM- AND CONTENT. (SEE THE COSN- GOPHER FOR MORE INFORMATION.)------- II. D. U.S. STATE PROJECTS-------- IN THE U.S., STATE-LEVEL DISCUSSION ARE UNDERWAY FOR- A MIX OF CONNECTIVITY AND CONTENT SOLUTIONS.---- MANY STATES HAVE DECIDED NOT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL- AND ARE- RECOMMENDING SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS CONNECT TO- EXISTING MIDLEVEL- AND COMMERCIAL NETWORKS, WHILE- PROVIDING A MULTI-PHASE APPROACH TO- GIVING TEACHERS- AND ADMINISTRATORS INTERNET CONNECTIVITY.---- ONE EXAMPLE OF STATE-BASED EDUCATION NETWORKING IS- THE TEXAS- EDUCATION NETWORK, ALSO KNOWN AS TENET.-TENET HAS RECEIVED LOTS OF ATTENTION BECAUSE OF ITS- SUCCESS IN- LEVERAGING AN EXISTING NETWORK, THE TEXAS- HIGHER EDUCATION- NETWORK (THENET) AS A BACKBONE- NETWORKING INFRASTRUCTURE.- THENET- IS A STATEWIDE- INTERNET-CONNECTED NETWORK THAT PROVIDES SERVICES- TO- OVER 100 EDUCATION AND RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS IN TEXAS.-IT IS- OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF- TEXAS SYSTEM OFFICE- OF TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES- IN AUSTIN, TEXAS.---- THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS ARE MINIMAL; AN- EDUCATOR- CAN DIAL INTO 1 OF 18 LOCAL POINTS OF PRESENCE- (CISCO COMMSERVERS AND MODEM POOLS CONNECTED TO- THENET MEMBER UNIVERSITIES) USING EXISTING- EQUIPMENT IN HIS HOME OR CLASSROOM: A COMPUTER (PC- OR MACINTOSH), A MODEM AND A PHONE LINE.--AN- 800 NUMBER SERVES THOSE NOT LOCATED IN A LOCAL CALLING AREA.-)THE COSTS FOR ACCESS ARE LOW; TEACHERS CAN CURRENTLY GET- AN ACCOUNT ON THE TENET COMPUTERS FOR----YEAR.---- THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT IS OBVIOUS: AFTER A LITTLE- OVER- 2 YEARS OF OPERATION, 30,000 EDUCATORS ARE USING- TENET.- THE- INTERNET AND TENET HAVE BEEN- DEMONSTRATED ENTHUSIASTICALLY IN- EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT- AND THE BENEFITS AND USES ARE NOW OBVIOUS- TO MANY- PEOPLE.- AS A RESULT, MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PLANNING-- FOR DIRECT CONNECTIONS TO THE TEXAS HIGHER EDUCATION- NETWORK.- ADDITIONALLY, ALL 20 TEXAS EDUCATION SERVICE- CENTERS- (ESCS) HAVE RECENTLY CONNECTED TO THENET.---- OTHER STATES HAVE HAD SIMILAR SUCCESSES TO- TENET'S.- VIRGINIA'S- PUBLIC EDUCATION NETWORK- (VAPEN) AND FLORIDA'S INFORMATION RESOURCE NETWORK- (FIRN) ARE ALSO DIAL-UP NETWORKS SERVICING THOUSANDS- AND THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS.- THE STATE OF- CALIFORNIA- OFFERS DIAL-UP INTERNET ACCESS TO TEACHERS THROUGH THE-- CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY (CSU) NETWORK; THIS K--12 NETWORK IS- CALLED CALIFORNIA ON-LINE RESOURCES FOR- EDUCATION (CORE) AND IS- OPERATED BOTH BY THE- CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY- SYSTEM AND THE CALIFORNIA- DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.- OREGON ANNOUNCED IN- SEPTEMBER 1993 THEIR AMBITIOUS OPEN INITIATIVE- (OREGON PUBLIC EDUCATION NETWORK) TO CONNECT ALL- SCHOOL DISTRICTS, GIVING INTERNET ACCESS TO- 500,000 EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS. HAWAII IS INVESTIGATING- INTERCONNECTING ALL OF ITS PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO A STATEWIDE- CABLE SYSTEM. AND OTHER STATES HAVE ANNOUNCED OR ARE- WORKING ON STATEWIDE INITIATIVES.------- III. BENEFITS OF USING THE INTERNET FOR- EDUCATION-------- IN ORDER FOR THE INTERNET TO SUCCESSFULLY BE INTEGRATED- INTO- SCHOOLS, BENEFITS MUST BE SHOWN FOR ALL ASPECTS- OF EDUCATION:-- INSTRUCTIONAL, ADMINISTRATIVE-, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND- COMMUNITY- INVOLVEMENT.- THE INTERNET IS ALREADY PROVING ITSELF IN-- THESE AREAS AS EVIDENCED BY SOME MAJOR INITIATIVES.-SOME OF- THESE PROJECTS ARE DESCRIBED HERE.------- III. A. ADMINISTRATIVE USES-------- THERE IS QUITE A BIG BUSINESS IN US EDUCATION FOR- ADMINISTRATIVE- APPLICATIONS--SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE--EVERYTHING FROM STUDENT RECORD CREATION AND- MAINTENANCE, CLASS SCHEDULING, TO FOOD SERVICES AND- ACCOUNTING.- FOR THE MOST PART, THESE SYSTEMS ARE- ACCESSIBLE TO LOCAL- DISTRICT OR REGIONS ONLY AND ARE NOT- NETWORKED INTO LARGER- SYSTEMS.---- THIS IS UNFORTUNATE AS THERE IS MUCH NEED FOR THE- ABILITY TO- TRANSFER ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION BETWEEN- SCHOOLS AND- DISTRICTS.- THE US STUDENT POPULATION IS- VERY MOBILE.- ACCORDING- TO "A STUDY OF THE- FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A STATEWIDE PROCESS- FOR- ELECTRONICALLY SHARING STUDENT INFORMATION" (A- COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF- EDUCATION, FAR WEST-LABORATORY FOR EDUCATIONAL- RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE CALIFORNIA- EDUCATIONAL DATA PROCESSING ASSOCIATION, PUBLISHED- OCTOBER 1992), IT IS ESTIMATED- IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THAT- AS MANY AS 20% OF THE STUDENT POPULATION- CHANGE- SCHOOLS ANNUALLY.---- FURTHERMORE, ACCORDING TO THE STUDY, THE CURRENT- METHOD FOR- EXCHANGING STUDENT RECORDS AND REPORTING TO- STATE AND FEDERAL- AGENCIES COSTS CALIFORNIA A STAGGERING- $50 MILLION EACH YEAR.- IT'S NOT ONLY EXPENSIVE, IT'S- TIME CONSUMING; THE AVERAGE TIME- SPENT TRANSFERRING A- RECORD USING THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS 24 DAYS.--------------------- [1] CLEARLY WHAT IS NEEDED ARE STANDARDS FOR THE- EXCHANGE OF THIS- INFORMATION ACROSS A COMMON- NETWORK, SUCH AS THE INTERNET.- USING- ELECTRONIC- DOCUMENT INTEREXCHANGE (EDI), STUDENT RECORDS COULD- BE- TRANSFERRED ACROSS THE INTERNET TO OTHER SCHOOLS, AS- WELL AS- UNIVERSITIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE- TIME COULD BE CUT FROM- WEEKS TO SECONDS AND THE COST- SAVINGS ESTIMATED ARE CONSIDERABLE;- ACCORDING TO THE- ABOVE CALIFORNIA STUDY, THE COST DROPS FROM THE CURRENT-- AVERAGE $15 PER TRANSFERRED RECORD TO--- $(AND SOME- PEOPLE THINK- THAT $4 IS TOO HIGH, THAT THE COST COULD- BE MERE PENNIES PER- RECORD.) INDEED, WITH SAVINGS LIKE- THESE, A BUSINESS CASE CAN- CERTAINLY BE MADE FOR- INSTALLING A NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND A LINK TO THE- INTERNET.---- A PROJECT CALLED SPEEDE/EXPRESS, THE--STANDARDIZATION OF POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION ELECTRONIC- DATA EXCHANGE/EXCHANGE OF PERMANENT RECORDS- ELECTRONICALLY FOR STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS, IS TAKING THE- LEAD IN DEFINING STANDARD RECORD FORMATS, AND IS ALSO- WORKING WITH SCHOOLS, UNIVERSITIES AND STATES TO- IMPLEMENT PILOT PROJECTS. THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS IS- CURRENTLY EXCHANGING RECORDS IN THIS FASHION WITH THE- AUSTIN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT AND IS PLANNING ON- ADDING OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND SCHOOLS. THERE ARE SIMILAR- PILOTS IN ARIZONA, FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA.---- IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME BEFORE STANDARDS EXIST FOR A- UBIQUITOUS- NETWORKED STUDENT RECORD TRANSFER SYSTEM.-BUT THE INTERNET IS- SERVING IN OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE- CAPACITIES. THE TEXAS EDUCATION- AGENCY (TEA-)CURRENTLY MAKES MANY DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE ON-LINE ON-- TENET, INCLUDING CALENDARS, LEGISLATIVE SUMMARIES-, DIRECTORIES-, FORMS AND SPREADSHEETS.- THE HARD COPY- VERSIONS ARE ALSO MAILED- TO SCHOOLS, BUT AN INCREASING- NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE REALIZING THEY- CAN RECEIVE THE- INFORMATION MUCH FASTER BY DOWNLOADING IT FROM- THE- NETWORK.- TEA COULD SAVE MILLIONS OF- DOLLARS IN- DUPLICATION AND POSTAGE BY MAKING THESE DOCUMENTS-- SOLELY AVAILABLE VIA THE NETWORK. INDEED, THE STATE OF- TEXAS HAS ESTIMATED ANNUAL SAVINGS OF $1.4 MILLION- BASED SOLELY ON ACCESS TO TENET.------- III. B. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT-------- MANY TEACHERS ARE USING THE INTERNET FOR- PROFESSIONAL- DEVELOPMENT. CONSIDER THE PLIGHT OF- SPECIALIZED INSTRUCTORS, SUCH- AS JOURNALISM OR PHYSICS- TEACHERS.- MANY SCHOOLS OR SCHOOL- DISTRICTS ONLY- EMPLOY ONE SUCH TEACHER.- AS A RESULT, THE- LIBRARIAN OR- WOODWORKING INSTRUCTOR OFTEN FEELS ISOLATED AND MUST-- BECOME VERY SELF SUFFICIENT IN AREAS SUCH AS CURRICULUM- AND- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.- WITH A NETWORK SUCH- AS THE INTERNET-, THESE TEACHERS NOW HAVE SUPPORT- GROUPS; "PLACES" A TEACHER CAN GO- TO SHARE IDEAS WITH- AND ASK QUESTIONS OF OTHERS IN THEIR- DISCIPLINE, AS WELL- AS DOWNLOAD RESOURCES FOR USE IN THE- CLASSROOM.---- FOR EXAMPLE, PAT GATHRIGHT, THE JOURNALISM TEACHER- AT MACARTHUR- HIGH SCHOOL IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, IS- A TRUE BELIEVER IN THE- BENEFITS OF NETWORKING AND USING- THE INTERNET.- MS. GATHRIGHT HAS- A TENET ACCOUNT AND- USES IT TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER INTERNET-CONNECTED- JOURNALISM TEACHERS ACROSS TEXAS AND THE US.---- "I HAVE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY ON MY CAMPUS FOR- THE YEARBOOK-, NEWSPAPER, JOURNALISM I, AND- PHOTOJOURNALISM," SHE SAYS. "FEW OF- MY FELLOW- TEACHERS CAN COME CLOSE TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT MY JOB- IS- LIKE OR HELP ME WITH SOME OF THE PROBLEMS I FACE- EACH DAY.- BUT- KNOW THAT I CAN LOG ONTO THE INTERNET- AND SHARE WITH MY- JOURNALISM FRIENDS ACROSS THE STATE A- DESKTOP PUBLISHING TRICK- THAT I LEARNED AT A WORKSHOP-, A PLACE TO FIND INFORMATION ON A- STORY MY STUDENTS ARE- WORKING ON, OR JUST NEWS ABOUT MY DAY.---------------------" [2] BEFORE TENET EXISTED, JOURNALISM TEACHERS LIKE- MS. GATHRIGHT MET ONCE A YEAR AT THEIR ANNUAL- CONFERENCE IN AUSTIN.- NOW MANY TENET-CONNECTED- TEACHERS MEET ONLINE 24 HOURS A DAY, 365 DAYS A YEAR.---- MANY TEACHERS ARE USING THE INTERNET TO COORDINATE- PROJECTS WITH CLASSROOMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.- FOR- EXAMPLE, HELEN BELL, THE SCHOOL LIBRARIAN AT LINCOLN- JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL IN EL PASO, TEXAS, HAS BEEN- CORRESPONDING WITH TAICHI KAMEYAMA, A PROFESSOR AT- GIFU UNIVERSITY IN JAPAN WHO HAS ASSISTED IN- COORDINATING PROJECTS BETWEEN A LOCAL JAPANESE HIGH- SCHOOL AND LINCOLN.- JULIETTE AVOTS FROM WELLESLEY- HIGH SCHOOL IN MASSACHUSETTS ALSO WORKS WITH- TEACHERS IN FRANCE TO DEVELOP STRUCTURED LANGUAGE- PROJECTS.---- IN ADDITION TO COLLABORATING WITH COLLEAGUES AND- DEVELOPING JOINT PROJECTS, TEACHERS CAN ALSO- ENGAGE IN- DIALOGUES WITH FIELD EXPERTS. USING THE INTERNET--, TEACHERS CAN CONNECT TO NASA'S SPACELINK (OPERATED BY- THE- MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER IN HUNTSVILLE- ALABAMA) AND SEND- QUESTIONS TO SPACE EXPERTS-, INCLUDING SPACE SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS.---- ANOTHER PROJECT PROVIDED BY THE EDUCATIONAL- RESOURCES INFORMATION- CENTER (ERIC), A US NATIONAL- INFORMATION SYSTEM, PROVIDES AN- INTERNET-BASED- QUESTION-ANSWERING SERVICE FOR TEACHERS, LIBRARY- MEDIA- SPECIALISTS, AND ADMINISTRATORS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS- ABOUT K- 12 EDUCATION, LEARNING, TEACHING, INFORMATION- TECHNOLOGY AND- EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION. ANYONE- INVOLVED WITH K-12 EDUCATION- CAN SEND AN E-MAIL- MESSAGE TO ASKERIC AND RECEIVE AN ANSWER- WITHIN- 48 WORKING HOURS.---- TEACHERS CAN ALSO DOWNLOAD USEFUL INFORMATION-, GUIDES AND IMAGES- FOR USE IN THE CLASSROOM.- MANY ARE- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ON-LINE- ASSOCIATED PRESS (AP) AND- REUTERS NEWSFEEDS, THE DAILY CNN (CABLE- NEWS- NETWORK) NEWSROOM CURRICULUM GUIDE, NASA SPACE- IMAGES, AND- REGULARLY UPDATED WEATHER REPORTS; ALL OF- THESE ARE EASILY- ACCESSIBLE AND AVAILABLE ON THE- INTERNET.------- III.C. BENEFITS FOR STUDENTS-------- ONE OF THE BEST PUBLICIZED USES OF THE INTERNET IS FOR-- INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES. CHILDREN LOVE COMPUTERS AND- COMPUTER- NETWORKS AND THERE ARE LOTS OF DISTANCE- LEARNING PROJECTS BEING- CONDUCTED, RANGING FROM- ELECTRONIC PENPALS TO- COLLABORATIVE/COMPARISON STUDIES.--ONE SUCH PROJECT INVOLVED STUDENTS FROM DIFFERENT- COUNTRIES- COMPARING PRICES, PACKAGING AND CONTENTS OF- VARIOUS PRODUCTS-, INTEGRATING MATH, SOCIAL STUDIES-, LANGUAGE AND GEOGRAPHY.- (MOST- OF THE STUDENTS WERE- NOT EVEN AWARE THEY WERE LEARNING!) OTHER- READILY- AVAILABLE INFORMATION SERVICES ARE PROVIDING STUDENTS-- WITH THE LATEST IN CURRENT EVENTS.- SOME OF THESE- INCLUDE US- WHITE HOUSE PRESS RELEASES AND BRIEFINGS;- RADIO FREE EUROPE- REPORTS; AND UN NEWS.---- RACHEL WESTON, A 7TH GRADER AT GEORGETOWN DAY- SCHOOL IN WASHINGTON DC, WROTE IN A RECENT ESSAY- HOW THE INTERNET HAS CHANGED HER LIFE.- "AS I FLIPPED- THROUGH MY E-MAIL MESSAGES ONE MORNING I SUDDENLY- RECEIVED A NEW ONE ENTITLED 'THE SYDNEY BUSH FIRES.'-- THE MAIL WAS FROM MY AUSTRALIAN KEYPAL, AND HE WAS- TELLING ME AND SOME OF HIS OTHER KEYPALS WHAT IT WAS- LIKE TO BE EXPERIENCING THE BUSH FIRES THAT WERE BURNING- ALL ROUND SYDNEY.---------------------" [6] RACHEL GOES ON TO DESCRIBE THE COMMUNICATION THAT- TOOK PLACE BETWEEN HER FRIEND AND HERSELF ON INTERNET- RELAY CHAT, HIS STORIES OF THE FIRES AND HOW CLOSE THEY- GOT TO HIS HOUSE.- IN ADDITION TO THE LIVE REPORTS, SHE- CLIPPED RELEVANT NEWSPAPER ARTICLES. "HOWEVER, ALL WEEK- LONG THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SYDNEY FIRES THAT I- BROUGHT TO CURRENT EVENTS IN MY SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS- WAS MORE UP TO DATE THAN ANYTHING IN THE NEWSPAPERS-,"SHE SAID.---- THIS IS A POWERFUL DEMONSTRATION OF HOW THE- INTERNET CREATES GLOBAL AND CULTURAL AWARENESS-, AUGMENTS CURRENT EVENTS CLASSES, AND MOTIVATES- STUDENTS TO WRITE. -HOWEVER, KEYPAL ACTIVITIES BY- THEMSELVES ARE NOT ALWAYS EFFECTIVE AND USUALLY FIZZLE- UNLESS THEY ARE GIVEN MORE STRUCTURE THAN JUST- ASSUMING STUDENTS WILL BE MOTIVATED TO CARRY ON A- DIALOGUE. STUDENTS NEED A THEME FOR THEIR- COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER KEYPALS.------- THE GLOBAL SCHOOLHOUSE-------- PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING USES OF THE- INTERNET RECENTLY- FOR EDUCATION IS THE GLOBAL- SCHOOLHOUSE PROJECT.- THIS PROJECT IS- ONE EXAMPLE OF- HOW THE INTERNET CAN BE USED TO TRANSMIT VIDEO FOR-- EDUCATIONAL USES. SPONSORED BY THE US NATIONAL- SCIENCE- FOUNDATION, THE GLOBAL SCHOOLHOUSE WAS- DEMONSTRATED DURING THE US- NATIONAL SCIENCE AND- TECHNOLOGY WEEK IN APRIL---------- THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS "SCHOOL WITHOUT WALLS---" WERE CHILDREN- AGES 10 THROUGH 13 FROM FOUR- GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTANT-SCHOOLS- -- JEFFERSON JUNIOR HIGH- SCHOOL IN OCEANSIDE, CALIFORNIA; CEDAR- BLUFF MIDDLE- SCHOOL IN KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE; LONGBRANCH-- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA; AND OLDFIELD- HOUSE- SCHOOL IN HAMPTON, UNITED KINGDOM.---- AS PART OF THEIR STUDIES, THE STUDENTS SPENT SIX- WEEKS PRIOR TO- THE EVENT STUDYING WATERSHED POLLUTION- IN THEIR LOCAL AREAS. THE- CURRICULUM WAS CREATED BY THE- FREDMAIL FOUNDATION (FREDMAIL- STANDS FOR FREE- EDUCATIONAL MAIL NETWORK), A NON-PROFIT- ORGANIZATION- DEVOTED TO CREATING AND FOSTERING MEANINGFUL- DISTANCE--BASED PROJECTS USING COMPUTER NETWORKS.---- THE STUDENTS HAD AN AMBITIOUS GOAL; TO READ EARTH- IN THE BALANCE- BY US VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE AND THEN- CONDUCT GROUND-WATER- POLLUTION STUDIES IN THEIR- COMMUNITIES. BEGINNING THREE WEEKS- BEFORE THE- DEMONSTRATION, THE STUDENTS MET IN TWO WEEKLY-- VIDEOCONFERENCE REHEARSALS OVER THE INTERNET TO GIVE- PROGRESS- REPORTS AND SHOW VIDEO CLIPS- OF THEIR- RESEARCH.---- DURING THE VIDEOCONFERENCES, EACH GROUP OF STUDENTS- COULD SEE, IN--REAL TIME, ALL OF THE OTHER GROUPS AND- THEMSELVES ON A QUARTERED- COMPUTER SCREEN.- FOR THE- DEMONSTRATION EVENT IN APRIL, US- GOVERNMENT- OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON, DC JOINED IN THE DISCUSSION--, LISTENING TO THE STUDENTS' REPORTS AND ASKING QUESTIONS.-THE- STUDENTS CONTINUED TO MEET IN WEEKLY- VIDEOCONFERENCES AFTER THE- DEMONSTRATION UNTIL THE END- OF THE SCHOOL YEAR; MORE MEETINGS- HAVE BEEN PLANNED- FOR THE FUTURE.---- DURING THE GLOBAL SCHOOLHOUSE VIDEOCONFERENCE, A- SUN- MICROSYSTEMS SPARCSTATION ACTED AS A REFLECTOR-, TAKING THE VIDEO- DATA FROM ONE SITE AND REFLECTING IT TO- THE OTHER THREE SITES.- A- SECOND REFLECTOR, LOCATED AT- CORNELL UNIVERSITY IN ITHACA, NEW- YORK, SENT COPIES- OF THE VIDEO DATA TO A VIEWING SITE IN VIENNA--, VIRGINIA, WHERE GUESTS COULD MONITOR THE- VIDEOCONFERENCE.- THE- SECOND REFLECTOR ALSO SENT THE- VIDEO DATA OUT OVER THE MULTICAST- BACKBONE, A- COLLECTION OF SITES AROUND THE WORLD THAT COOPERATE- IN- GLOBAL VIDEO AND AUDIO CONFERENCING FOR VARIOUS EVENTS.---- DURING THE VIDEOCONFERENCE, EACH DESKTOP COMPUTER- HAD- A VIDEO- CAMERA AND A PROJECTOR CONNECTED TO THE- MONITOR.- THE VIDEO- CAMERA FED THE LIVE ACTION TO THE- COMPUTER.- AUDIO WAS PROVIDED- BY A TRADITIONAL AUDIO- CONFERENCE BRIDGE.- CISCO ROUTERS PROVIDED- THE MAIN- GATEWAY BETWEEN THE LANS AND THE INTERNET AND T1 OR-- SWITCHED MULTIMEGABIT DATA SERVICE (SMDS) LINES- PROVIDED ACCESS- TO THE WAN.---- THE VIDEOCONFERENCING SOFTWARE, CU-SEEME, IS- FREELY AVAILABLE ON- THE INTERNET AND IS STILL CURRENTLY- BEING DEVELOPED BY CORNELL- UNIVERSITY'S INFORMATION- TECHNOLOGY ORGANIZATION (CIT). IT-ALLOWS- ONE-TO-ONE-, ONE-TO-MANY, OR MANY-TO-MANY CONNECTIONS.- A USER- CAN- BE EITHER A RECEIVER, OR A SENDER AND RECEIVER.- TO- RECEIVE, ONE- ONLY NEEDS AN INTERNET-CONNECTED- MACINTOSH CAPABLE OF DISPLAYING- 16 GRAYS.- SENDING- REQUIRES THE SAME PLUS A SUPERMAC VIDEOSPIGOT- BOARD-, A CAMERA, QUICKTIME AND SPIGOT VDIG EXTENSIONS- ADDED TO- THE SYSTEM.---- UNTIL RECENTLY, MOST PARTICIPANTS IN GLOBAL- SCHOOLHOUSE PROJECTS USED THE MESSAGE SCRAWL FEATURE- OF CU-SEEME OR AUDIO-CONFERENCE BRIDGES.- REAL-TIME- AUDIOCONFERENCING SOFTWARE WAS RELEASED FOR THE- MACINTOSH- IN MARCH 1994 AND IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE- OVER THE INTERNET. (PLEASE SEE THE- RESOURCES SECTION AT- THE END OF THIS PAPER.)------- III.D. COMMUNITY OUTREACH-------- IN ADDITION TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND EDUCATIONAL- BENEFITS- ACHIEVED BY ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, THERE ARE- ADVANTAGES TO- PROVIDING COMMUNITY ACCESS TO SCHOOL- RESOURCES.- SOME SCHOOLS AND- NETWORK PROJECTS ARE- ENCOURAGING PARENTS TO BECOME INVOLVED AND- HAVE- OFFERED ACCESS VIA DIALUP ACCOUNTS TO SCHOOL SYSTEMS.-HOMEWORK- ASSIGNMENT ARCHIVES, SCHEDULES, CALENDARS-, LUNCH MENUS, ETC.- ARE JUST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN- BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.-- ADDITIONALLY, TEACHERS ARE- MORE ACCESSIBLE VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL- FOR PARENT/TEACHER- CONFERENCES.---- WHILE COMMUNITY ACCESS IS NOT AS- WELL DEFINED OR- PUBLICIZED YET, IT IS A CRUCIAL PART OF THE- EDUCATIONAL- AND COMMUNITY BUILDING USE OF THE INTERNET. SEVERAL- SCHOOLS ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH PROVIDING LOW-COST- ACCOUNTS (TO HELP PAY FOR THEIR NETWORKING COSTS) TO- PARENTS AND MEMBERS OF THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY TO- PROVIDE ACCESS TO LOCAL SCHOOL INFORMATION AND THE- INTERNET.------- IV. BARRIERS AND SOLUTIONS-------- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE INTERNET IS AUGMENTING- TRADITIONAL- CLASSES WITH LIVE DATA FROM DISTANT LANDS AND- CULTURAL EXCHANGE- BETWEEN CHILDREN. UNFORTUNATELY-, THERE ARE QUITE A FEW BARRIERS- PREVENTING TEACHERS AND- SCHOOLS FROM MAKING THE CONNECTION.------- IV.A. INTERNETWORKING EXPERTISE-------- FOR- ONE, THERE IS A LACK OF INTERNETWORKING- TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND- VISION.- FRANKLY, IT'S HARD- ENOUGH FOR ANYONE THESE DAYS TO MAKE HEADS OR- TAILS OF- THE BEWILDERING NUMBER OF CHOICES, AND SO IT'S-- UNDERSTANDABLE THAT SCHOOLS ARE HAVING PROBLEMS- FIGURING OUT- WHICH WAY TO GO.- THERE'S CONCERN THAT- COMMITTING TO ONE DISTANCE LEARNING SOLUTION WILL- PROHIBIT UPGRADING TO FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES.---- THERE'S ALSO THE CONFUSION OF HOW TO ESTABLISH A- WIDE AREA CONNECTION.- IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE FOR US- TO FULLY- UNDERSTAND HOW THE CONVERGENCE OF THE- BROADCAST, TELEPHONE AND- COMPUTER INDUSTRIES IS GOING- TO PLAY OUT AND WHO THE PLAYERS WILL- BE.- IN THE US-, BOTH TELEPHONE AND CABLE COMPANIES ARE PROMISING- CONNECTIONS AND REDUCED RATES IN HOPES OF CAPTURING THE- EDUCATIONAL MARKET.-----THERE ARE MANY OPEN SYSTEM SOLUTIONS, MANY- STANDARDS AND MANY -VENDORS PROMISING THE "ONLY-"SOLUTIONS.- ONE ORGANIZATION CALLED- THE NATIONAL- CENTER FOR TECHNOLOGY PLANNING (NCTP) IS TRYING TO---HELP. LOCATED AT-MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY, NCTP- IS PROVIDING- NETWORK PLANNING AND DIRECTION TO MANY- SCHOOLS AND ARCHIVING--TECHNOLOGY PLANS ON THE -INTERNET.-----OTHER PROJECTS AND STUDIES PROVIDE SOME DIRECTION.-FOR EXAMPLE, THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS DRAFTING A- STRATEGIC PLAN FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, WHICH- OUTLINES A VISION FOR THE USE OF COMPUTER AND- COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS IN-CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. -PART- OF THIS PLAN INCLUDES A TECHNICAL MODEL FOR SCHOOL- NETWORKS GUIDE. ANOTHER-RESEARCH STUDY CONDUCTED BY- BOLT BERANEK AND NEWMAN PROVIDED SEVERAL CURRENT AND- FUTURE MODELS FOR SCHOOLS.- THE INTERNET ENGINEERING- TASK FORCE INTERNET SCHOOL WORKING GROUP IS DRAFTING- A K-12 INTERNETWORKING GUIDELINES DOCUMENT, INTENDED- TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL GUIDANCE TO THE EDUCATIONAL- COMMUNITY ON SCHOOL NETWORKING AND CONNECTIONS TO- THE INTERNET.- ALL OF THESE DOCUMENTS ARE LISTED IN THE- RESOURCES SECTION OF THIS PAPER.------- IV. B. EXISTING NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE-------- PERHAPS THE CONFUSING-TECHNOLOGY AND LARGE NUMBER- OF CHOICES IS- PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEXT BARRIER:-THE LACK OF EXISTING- NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE.- A- SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF SCHOOLS- DON'T HAVE LOCAL AREA- NETWORKS IN THE COMPUTER LABS.- THEREFORE- ACCESS TO- THE INTERNET FOR THE TIME BEING IS LIMITED TO STAND-- ALONE MACHINES WITH MODEMS.---- UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF- MOST STATES- IN THE US PERMITTING PHONE COMPANIES TO- CHARGE BUSINESS RATES FOR- TELEPHONES IN SCHOOLS, THERE- ARE VERY FEW PHONE LINES IN THE- CLASSROOMS.- IT IS- NECESSARY TO EDUCATE THE STATE PUBLIC UTILITY-- COMMISSIONS (PUCS) ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF ACCESS TO- THE INTERNET- VIA A PHONE IN THE CLASSROOM; INDEED, THERE- HAVE ALREADY BEEN- SEVERAL SUCCESS STORIES IN SOME- STATES WHERE REGULATION WAS- INTRODUCED TO LOWER COSTS- FOR PHONE LINES IN SCHOOLS.---- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO EDUCATE THE SCHOOL AND DISTRICT- TECHNOLOGY PLANNERS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SCALING THEIR- NETWORKING SOLUTIONS EFFECTIVELY.- ONE PHONE LINE IN A- COMPUTER LAB IS A GREAT START TO DEMONSTRATE THE BENEFITS- OF THE INTERNET.- HOWEVER, THE COMPUTER/PHONE- LINE/MODEM MODEL DOESN'T SCALE WELL -- THE COST OF- ADDING PHONE LINES AND MODEMS INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY-, BUT THE BANDWIDTH AND INCREASED ACCESS TO RESOURCES DO- NOT.- DIALUP ACCESS IS AN EASIER SOLUTION TO UNDERSTAND- AND IMPLEMENT INITIALLY, BUT ULTIMATELY HARDER FOR THE- END-USER TO LEARN, AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO SCALE.-SCHOOLS NEED TO BE EDUCATED ON THE INTERNETWORKING- MODEL, THAT IS, CONNECTING NETWORKS TO NETWORKS.-BUILDING A GOOD LOCAL AREA NETWORK FOUNDATION IS- CRUCIAL.---- IN ADDITION TO A SCALABLE LOCAL AREA NETWORK, SCHOOLS- WILL NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ADMINISTRATING EMAIL- ACCOUNTS, NEWSFEEDS, LOCAL INFORMATION SERVERS AND- OTHER NETWORK-RELATED CONFIGURATION DUTIES.- A SERVER- THAT MAKES THESE TASKS CONSIDERABLY EASIER, AND- INTEGRATES EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE IN A DISTRIBUTED- NETWORKED ENVIRONMENT IS THE COPERNICUS SYSTEM-, DEVELOPED BY BOLT, BERANEK AND NEWMAN IN- CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PILOT- SITES WHICH ARE USING THIS SERVER VERY SUCCESSFULLY.-ONE OF THESE IS THE RALPH BUNCHE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL- IN NEW YORK, NY.- PAUL REESE THE COMPUTER----- & TECHNOLOGY COORDINATOR, SAYS, "WE SUPPORT SOME- 350 E-MAIL ACCOUNTS, A SCHOOL GOPHER, PRIVATE AND PUBLIC- NEWSGROUPS AND ARE DEVELOPING OTHER SERVICES.- THE- SERVER SITS ON A LAN WITH APPROXIMATELY 70 MAC- WORKSTATIONS.- A RECENTLY INSTALLED 56 KBPS LINE NOW- CONNECTS A NEIGHBORING MIDDLE SCHOOL ALLOWING THEM- TO USE THE SERVER AND SHARE GENERAL NETWORK ACCESS.-------" IV.C. FUNDING-------- ANOTHER BARRIER IS ONE OF THE OLDEST PROBLEMS- SCHOOLS HAVE FACED;- THAT IS, FUNDING FOR JUST ABOUT- ANYTHING THAT IS NEEDED. THIS- WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE A- PROBLEM UNTIL SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS- ESTABLISH VISIONS- AND PLANS. BUSINESS-CASES CAN AND ARE BEING- MADE FOR- ADMINISTRATIVE USES.- SAVINGS ON EDUCATIONAL TOOLS SUCH-- AS TEXTBOOKS WILL BE REALIZED AS MORE AND MORE ON-LINE- BOOKS ARE- DISTRIBUTED ELECTRONICALLY.- ONCE DIFFERENCES- ARE RESOLVED AND STANDARDS MADE FOR THE TRANSFER OF SUCH- USEFUL INFORMATION, SUCH AS STUDENT RECORDS AND BOOKS-, IT WILL BE EASIER TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR NETWORK- CONNECTIVITY AND ACCESS.---- IN THE MEANTIME, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SOURCES FOR- FUNDS IN THE U.S.. THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION- HAS AN INTERNET CONNECTIONS PROGRAM TO WHICH SCHOOLS- AND ORGANIZATIONS CAN APPLY FOR GRANTS. THE NATIONAL- TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION- (NTIA) RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A GRANT PROGRAM TO FUND- PLANNING AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT (AMONG OTHER- THINGS) PROMOTE THE GOALS OF DEVELOPMENT AND- WIDESPREAD AVAILABILITY OF ADVANCED TELECOMMUNICATIONS- TECHNOLOGIES AND SUPPORT THE ADVANCEMENT OF AN- ADVANCED NATIONWIDE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND- INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE. BOTH THE NSF AND NTIA- PROGRAMS BENEFIT OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS- UNIVERSITIES AND SCHOOLS.------- IV. D. USER APPLICATIONS-------- IN ADDITION TO THE BEWILDERING AMOUNT OF- INFORMATION AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET-, THERE'S ALSO THE PERCEIVED NOTION THAT THE INTERNET IS- DELIBERATELY USER HOSTILE.---- THE INTERNET IS GROWING UP SOMEWHAT IN THIS AREA- WITH THE WIDER AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION DISCOVERY- AND RETRIEVAL APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS- ARCHIE, GOPHER-, WIDE AREA INFORMATION SERVERS (WAIS) AND THE-- WORLD- WIDE WEB (WWW). MOST INTERNET-CONNECTED EDUCATION- NETWORKS- OFFER AT LEAST A SIMPLE MENU INTERFACE TO THE- INTERNET.- A- GRAPHICAL PROGRAM CALLED "GRAPHICAL- INTERFACE TO NETWORK ACCESS" OR GINA (FORMERLY- KNOWN AS "THE GUIDE-") IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT-- BY THE CALIFORNIA TECHNOLOGY PROJECT AND REVIEWS OF IT- ARE- CONFIRMING ITS PROMISE TO BE ONE OF THE EASIEST TO- USE GRAPHICAL INTERFACES- TO THE INTERNET YET.------- IV. E. INFORMATION AGE PROJECTS-------- AND FINALLY, ANOTHER BARRIER TO USING THE INTERNET IN- THE- CLASSROOM IS MOTIVATING TEACHERS TO THROW AWAY- THE OUT-DATED-, INCORRECT TEXTBOOKS AND INSTEAD ENGAGE- STUDENTS INTERACTIVELY-, EXPLORING THE WEB FOR CURRENT- EVENTS, REAL EXAMPLES AND THE- LATEST DATA.---- TRUE, THE INTERNET HAS A LITTLE WAY TO GO BEFORE IT- CAN RELIABLY- SERVE AS THE SOLE DIGITAL LAB OR CLASSROOM-, BUT THERE ARE PLENTY- OF USEFUL PROJECTS GOING ON RIGHT- NOW WHERE STUDENTS ARE- ENCOURAGED TO USE THEIR- CREATIVITY AND COMMON SENSE.- THE PROBLEM IS THAT- TEACHERS NEED HELP IN LEARNING HOW TO USE THIS- TECHNOLOGY- AND HOW TO APPLY IT TO TEACHING.---- WHAT IS NEEDED ARE MORE INTERNET EVANGELISTS-, PEOPLE THAT CAN- SIMPLIFY THE TECHNOLOGY AND- DEMONSTRATE THE BENEFITS. CURRIE MORRISON, A- TECHNOLOGY COORDINATOR AT NATHAN HALE HIGH SCHOOL- IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON IS SUCH AN EVANGELIST AND HAS- SEEN ENORMOUS BENEFITS FROM HER PROMOTIONAL EFFORTS.-SHE NOTED IN A RECENT MESSAGE SENT TO THE COSN EMAIL- DISCUSSION LIST, "MY ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE HAS SEEN A- LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IMPACTED BY WHAT I HAVE PASSED- ON TO COLLEAGUES AND STUDENTS ALIKE. TOO NUMEROUS TO- MENTION.----" JUST AS SCHOOL TECHNOLOGY COORDINATORS AND DIRECTORS- PLAN FOR NETWORKS- AND SCALABILITY, SO MUST TEACHERS- PLAN FOR THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY- IN THEIR CLASSROOMS.-TOO MANY ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONAL LEARNING- SYSTEMS ARE- SITTING GATHERING DUST BECAUSE OF LACK OF PLANNING IN-- THIS AREA.- MORE EMPHASIS MUST BE MADE BY ALL- NETWORK PLANNERS- (ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL-)INVOLVED ON TRAINING AND- MOTIVATION.---- THE PORT NECHES-GROVES SCHOOL DISTRICT IN- SOUTHEAST TEXAS HAS STARTED AN INTERESTING PROJECT- DESIGNED TO MOTIVATE AND ASSIST TEACHERS WITH- TRANSITIONING TO PLANNING AND DEVELOPING CLASSROOM- CURRICULUM PROJECTS IN AN ONLINE WORLD.- KAY- ABERNATHY, THE TECHNOLOGY COORDINATOR, IS PAIRING EACH- TEACHER INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT WITH AN ONLINE MENTOR- WHO IS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF TEXAS.- MENTORS WILL OFFER- ENCOURAGEMENT AND ASSISTANCE VIA ELECTONIC MAIL OVER- THE INTERNET TO TEACHERS WHO ARE JUST GETTING STARTED IN- USING THE TECHNOLOGY.- THE PORT NECHES-GROVES- TEACHERS WILL KEEP JOURNALS WHICH CHRONICLE THEIR- PROGRESS AND PROBLEMS.------- V. CONCLUSION-------- DESPITE BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES, THE K--12 COMMUNITY IS MOVING AHEAD.
