CUNNINGHAM------------------  MY POST PROVOKED SOME COMMENT FROM THE TALK.POLITICS.DRUGS NEWSGROUP, BUT NOT FROM TALK.POLITICS.GUNS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NICE DEFINITION.- ONE COMMENT ON THE COMMENTS.- IN THE DEFINITION #1 YOU TALK OF RESPONSIBLE USE VS MISUSE, YET IN THE COMMENTS YOU TALK OF-BENEFITS AND DESTRUCTIVENESS.- IN WHAT WAY DOES THE LACK OF HEROIN'S BENEFITS PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS BEING USED RESPONSIBLY?---NOTE: I AM NOT SAYING THAT-I KNOW ANY 'RESPONSIBLE' HEROIN ADDICTS.- I DON'T, BUT THAT-DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T EXIST.-) THE MEDICAL BENEFITS OF ALCOHOL OR POT CERTAINLY DON'T PRECLUDE THEM FROM BEING USED IRRESPONSIBLY.- IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE TOBACCO- RESPONSIBLY?---- NOT RAGGING, JUST POKING.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --N-----------------------------J------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ YOU RAISE VALID OBJECTIONS.- MY TERMINOLOGY AND DISCUSSION OF THE EXAMPLES WAS ARBITRARY AND OVERSIMPLIFIED.---- WHEN-TALKING ABOUT "MISUSE" AND "RESPONSIBLE USE", I HAD IN MIND IMPACT ON SOCIETY (EG WITH GUN OWNERSHIP).- BUT, YOU ARE RIGHT -- ACCORDING TO THE DICTIONARY, ONE CAN REFER TO "RESPONSIBLE" USE OF A RECREATIONAL OPTION THAT HAS NO EFFECT ON OTHERS, ONLY ON ONESELF.---- HEROIN-- EVEN IT HAS LEGITIMATE USES AS A PAINKILLER, ESPECIALLY IN SOME CANCER CASES.- AND MANY OF THE SAME PROHIBITIONISTS WHO FIERCELY-PROSECUTE DOCTORS INCLINED TO PRESCRIBE IT-(AND OTHER EFFECTIVE-PAIN-KILLERS) ARE AMONG THOSE MOST SELF-RIGHTEOUSLY OPPOSED TO PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE FOR THOSE WITH INTRACTABLE PAIN.-------- I CONFESS I DON'T KNOW THE-DETAILS ABOUT HEROIN'S EFFECT ON MOST-USERS, WHETHER THERE IS A "SLIPPERY SLOPE" OF ADDICTION LEADING INEXORABLY TO LARGER DOSES AND PHYSIOLOGICAL HARM, OR WHETHER, IN A MAINTENANCE ENVIRONMENT, ITS EFFECTS ARE STABILIZED AND THE USER CAN HAVE A PERFECTLY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE LIFE.---- TOBACCO-- YES, IT IS OFTEN USED "RESPONSIBLY" TO RAISE WORK PRODUCTIVITY.- FOR EXAMPLE, A FRIEND OF MINE WAS A NAVAL OFFICER.- WHENEVER HE WENT TO SEA--WITH THE USUAL SCHEDULE THAT ONLY ALLOWS ABOUT 3 HOURS OF SLEEP PER DAY, HE WOULD TAKE-UP SMOKING AS THE BEST WAY TO AVOID FALLING ASLEEP AT THE JOB.- WHENEVER HIS TOUR OF SEA DUTY ENDED, HOWEVER, HE WOULD QUIT WHEN HE CAME HOME TO HIS FAMILY, ALL NON-SMOKERS.------- I WOULD NOT USE THE WORD "RESPONSIBLE" FOR ACTUARIES WHO WOULD BALANCE US "SOCIAL SECURITY" PENSION-ACCOUNTS BY ENCOURAGING MORE SMOKING, BUT OTHERS MIGHT LEGITIMATELY TAX ME WITH OVERLY SQUEAMISH "POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.----" --HUGO S. CUNNINGHAM--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHEN HEROIN WAS LEGAL THERE WERE A GREAT MANY RESPONSIBLE HEROIN ADDICTS.- ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF JOHNS HOPKINS WAS A HEROIN ADDICT - HE USED IT IN PILL FORM - AND THE ADDICTION SEEMS TO HAVE HAD NO EFFECT ON HIS ABILITY TO BE A-PRODUCTIVE-MEMBER OF SOCIETY; EVEN HIS WIFE NEVER NOTICED.- HEROIN IS AN EXTREMELY POTENT COUGH-SUPPRESSANT AND ALSO AN EXTREMELY POTENT PAIN RELIEVER.- THE NAME "HEROIN--WAS ORIGINALLY THE BRAND NAME UNDER WHICH IT WAS MARKETED AS A COUGH SUPPRESSANT-BY THE BAYER CORPORATION.---- THE-CHIEF NEGATIVE EFFECT OF LONG-TERM HEROIN-USE IS CONSTIPATION.--IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY SAFE DRUG IF YOU CAN GET A REGULAR SUPPLY AND TAKE IT IN PILL FORM, WHICH IS WHAT ADDICTS AND RESPONSIBLE-USERS WOULD BE LIKELY TO DO-IF IT WERE CHEAP AND-LEGAL.- THE HEALTH DANGERS OF BEING A-HEROIN ADDICT TODAY ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY CAUSED BY THE-DRUG'S LEGAL STATUS.- THESE ARE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH SHOOTING UP, WITH NOT KNOWING THE PURITY OF THE DRUG, WITH NOT HAVING ACCESS TO CLEAN NEEDLES, AND WITH NOT HAVING CONSISTENT ACCESS TO THE DRUG.---- MY SOURCES FOR ALL OF THE ABOVE ARE:- (1) LICIT AND ILLICIT DRUGS- BY THE EDITORS OF CONSUMER REPORTS, AND (2) THE ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA.---- --GLEN RAPHAEL------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
