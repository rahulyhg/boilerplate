AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF TEST TAKERS: GUIDELINES AND EXPECTATIONS---------- PREAMBLE------------------------- THE INTENT OF THIS STATEMENT IS TO ENUMERATE AND CLARIFY THE EXPECTATIONS THAT TEST TAKERS MAY REASONABLY HAVE ABOUT THE-TESTING PROCESS, AND-THE EXPECTATIONS THAT THOSE WHO DEVELOP, ADMINISTER, AND USE TESTS MAY HAVE OF TEST TAKERS.-------------------------------- TESTS ARE DEFINED BROADLY HERE AS PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EDUCATIONAL INSTRUMENTS DEVELOPED AND USED BY TESTING PROFESSIONALS IN ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS SCHOOLS, INDUSTRIES, CLINICAL PRACTICE, COUNSELING SETTINGS AND HUMAN SERVICE AND OTHER AGENCIES, INCLUDING THOSE ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES AND DEVICES THAT ARE USED FOR MAKING INFERENCES ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE ABOVE-NAMED SETTINGS.------------------------ THE PURPOSE OF THE STATEMENT IS TO INFORM AND TO HELP EDUCATE NOT ONLY TEST TAKERS, BUT ALSO OTHERS INVOLVED IN THE TESTING ENTERPRISE SO THAT MEASUREMENTS MAY BE MOST VALIDLY AND APPROPRIATELY USED. THIS DOCUMENT IS INTENDED AS AN EFFORT TO INSPIRE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TESTING PROCESS AND DOES NOT HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW. ITS ORIENTATION IS TO ENCOURAGE POSITIVE AND HIGH QUALITY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TESTING PROFESSIONALS AND TEST TAKERS.------------------------ THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES LISTED IN THIS DOCUMENT ARE NEITHER LEGALLY BASED NOR INALIENABLE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES SUCH AS THOSE LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA'S BILL OF RIGHTS. RATHER, THEY REPRESENT THE BEST JUDGMENTS OF TESTING PROFESSIONALS ABOUT THE REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS THAT THOSE INVOLVED IN THE TESTING ENTERPRISE (TEST PRODUCERS, TEST USERS, AND TEST TAKERS) SHOULD HAVE OF EACH OTHER.------------------------ TESTING PROFESSIONALS INCLUDE DEVELOPERS OF ASSESSMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THOSE WHO MARKET AND SELL THEM, PERSONS WHO SELECT THEM, TEST ADMINISTRATORS AND SCORERS, THOSE WHO INTERPRET TEST RESULTS, AND TRAINED USERS OF THE INFORMATION. PERSONS WHO ENGAGE IN EACH OF THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE, IN DOCUMENTS SUCH AS THOSE THAT FOLLOW (AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR COUNSELING AND DEVELOPMENT, 1988; AMERICAN SPEECH-LANGUAGE-HEARING ASSOCIATION, 1994; JOINT COMMITTEE ON TESTING PRACTICES, 1988; NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS, 1992; NATIONAL-COUNCIL ON MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION, 1995).------------------------ IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, THE TEST DEVELOPER AND THE TEST USER MAY NOT BE THE SAME PERSON, GROUP OF PERSONS, OR ORGANIZATION. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THE PROFESSIONALS INVOLVED IN THE TESTING SHOULD CLARIFY, FOR THE TEST TAKER AS WELL AS FOR THEMSELVES, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EACH ASPECT OF THE TESTING PROCESS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL CHOOSES-TO TAKE A COLLEGE ADMISSIONS TEST, AT LEAST THREE PARTIES ARE INVOLVED IN ADDITION TO THE TEST TAKER: THE TEST DEVELOPER AND PUBLISHER, THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ADMINISTER THE TEST TO THE TEST TAKER, AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION WHO WILL EVENTUALLY USE THE INFORMATION. IN SUCH CASES A TEST TAKER MAY NEED TO REQUEST CLARIFICATIONS ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. WHEN TEST TAKERS ARE YOUNG CHILDREN (E.G., THOSE TAKING STANDARDIZED TESTS IN THE-SCHOOLS) OR ARE PERSONS WHO SPEND SOME OR ALL THEIR TIME IN INSTITUTIONS OR ARE INCAPACITATED, PARENTS OR GUARDIANS MAY BE GRANTED SOME OF THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES, RATHER THAN, OR IN ADDITION TO, THE INDIVIDUAL.------------------------ PERHAPS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TEST TAKERS HAVE IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE TESTS THAT MEET HIGH PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS, SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN STANDARDS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING (AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATION, AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION, & NATIONAL COUNCIL ON MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION, 1999) AS WELL AS THOSE OF OTHER APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. THIS STATEMENT SHOULD BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT, OR SUPPLEMENT, TO THOSE STANDARDS. STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS, OF COURSE, SUPERSEDE ANY RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE STATED HERE.--------- REFERENCES------------------------- AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR COUNSELING AND DEVELOPMENT (NOW AMERICAN COUNSELING ASSOCIATION) & ASSOCIATION FOR MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION IN COUNSELING AND DEVELOPMENT (NOW ASSOCIATION FOR ASSESSMENT IN COUNSELING).

AND THE KIND(S) OF TESTS AND FORMATS THAT WILL BE USED (E.G., INDIVIDUAL/GROUP, MULTIPLE-CHOICE/FREE RESPONSE/PERFORMANCE, TIMED/UNTIMED, ETC.), UNLESS SUCH INFORMATION MIGHT BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE OBJECTIVES OF THE TEST.---------------------------------------- TELL TEST TAKERS, PRIOR TO TESTING, ABOUT THE PLANNED USE(S) OF THE TEST RESULTS.
