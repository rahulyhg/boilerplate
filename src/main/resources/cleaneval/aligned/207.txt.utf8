NEGOTIATING FOR SUCCESS---BASIC STAGES (PART 1-IN--- A SERIES OF 3)----------  EVERYONE NEGOTIATES. WE NEGOTIATE WITH-FAMILY MEMBERS ABOUT-HOW TO SPEND--- VACATION TIME; WE NEGOTIATE WITH FRIENDS ABOUT HOW TO PICK UP THE TAB--- FOR DINNER; WE NEGOTIATE WITH CONTRACTORS ABOUT WHEN TO COME TO-THE HOUSE--- FOR A DELIVERY OR REPAIRS. PHYSICIANS NEGOTIATE WITH PATIENTS WHEN DISCUSSING--- ALTERNATIVES OF MEDICAL VERSUS SURGICAL THERAPY OR, OFTEN TIMES, NO THERAPY.--- SCIENTISTS NEGOTIATE FOR TIME AND SPACE TO CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS. ALL OF--- US NEGOTIATE FOR SALARY AND JOB RESPONSIBILITIES. WHILE EACH OF THESE--- EXAMPLES HAS A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF RISK AND-IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME, EACH--- REQUIRES BASIC COMMUNICATION SKILLS TO BE EFFECTIVE.----------  RICHARD SHELL, IN HIS BOOK, BARGAINING FOR ADVANTAGE (PENGUIN BOOKS---, 1999) DEFINES NEGOTIATION AS----- "AN INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION PROCESS--- THAT MAY TAKE PLACE WHENEVER WE WANT SOMETHING FROM SOMEONE ELSE OR ANOTHER--- PERSON WANTS SOMETHING FROM US.-----" SHELL DESCRIBES THE PROCESS IN FOUR--- STAGES: PREPARATION, EXCHANGING INFORMATION, BARGAINING, AND CLOSING AND--- COMMITMENT.----------  THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE FOUR PHASES USING EXAMPLES FROM COMMON INTERACTIONS--- OF FACULTY NEGOTIATING FOR NEW POSITIONS IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS. THE EXAMPLES--- ARE DRAWN IN PART FROM VIGNETTES DISCUSSED DURING SESSIONS ON---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NEGOTIATION DURING THIS YEAR'S--- AAMC EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT SERIES, REITERATES: YOU WILL BE A BETTER NEGOTIATOR--- IF YOU PREPARE THOROUGHLY. SIMPLE ADVICE, BUT WORTH EMPHASIZING. PREPARATION--- INCLUDES RESEARCHING STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES BY WHICH NEGOTIATING PARTIES--- MAY REACH COMMON GROUND. PREPARATION INCLUDES KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR OWN VALUES--- ON THE ISSUE BEING NEGOTIATED AS WELL AS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERCEIVED NEEDS--- AND VALUES OF THE OTHER PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSION. IT IS IMPORTANT--- TO BE AWARE OF YOUR OWN BARGAINING STYLE AS WELL AS THAT OF THE OTHER--- PARTY. (MORE ON BARGAINING STYLES-AVOIDANCE, COMPROMISE, ACCOMMODATION---, COMPETITION, AND PROBLEM SOLVING IN SUBSEQUENT ISSUES OF--- FACULTY VITAE------------)--  EXCHANGING INFORMATION----------  THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT STAGE OF NEGOTIATION. IN 1978, A STUDY--- OF ENGLISH LABOR AND CONTRACT NEGOTIATORS ENGAGED IN ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS--- SHOWED THAT SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATORS ASKED TWICE THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS--- AND SPENT OVER TWICE THE AMOUNT OF TIME ACQUIRING AND CLARIFYING INFORMATION--- THAN DID AVERAGE NEGOTIATORS. (REFERENCED IN SHELL, BARGAINING FOR ADVANTAGE-.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  NEGOTIATING BEHAVIOR-------------------------------------------------------  SKILLED-------------------------------------------------------  AVERAGE-------------------------------------------------------------------------  QUESTIONS, AS % OF ALL NEGOTIATING BEHAVIOR------------------------- 21.-------------------------3 9.----------------------------------------------------------6  ACTIVE LISTENING: TESTING FOR UNDERSTANDING------------------------- 9.-------------------------7 4.----------------------------------------------------------1  ACTIVE LISTENING: SUMMARIZING------------------------- 7.-------------------------5 4.----------------------------------------------------------2  TOTAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE------------------------- 38.-------------------------5 17.-----------------------------------9  MANY OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES SINCE 1978 HAVE CONFIRMED THE IMPORTANCE OF--- THESE BASIC COMMUNICATIONS SKILLS IN EFFECTIVE NEGOTIATION. HENRY FORD--- GAVE ADVICE ON SUCH COMMUNICATION: "IF THERE IS ANY ONE SECRET OF SUCCESS---" HE SAID, "IT LIES IN THE ABILITY TO GET THE OTHER PERSON'S POINT OF VIEW--- AND SEE THINGS FROM THAT PERSON'S ANGLE AS WELL AS FROM YOUR OWN." WHY--- ARE COMMUNICATION SKILLS SO IMPORTANT IN THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF INTERACTION?--- SHELL SURMISES, "MOST PEOPLE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE AN ATTENTIVE AUDIENCE--- THAT THEY TAKE LITTLE NOTICE OF YOUR TACTFUL PROBING UNTIL THEY SUDDENLY--- FEEL THE URGE TO GET A FEW ANSWERS THEMSELVES. BY THEN THE EFFECTIVE NEGOTIATOR--- HAS THE INFORMATION HE OR SHE NEEDS TO FRAME JUST THE RIGHT RESPONSES.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"  WHEN DR. TIMOTHY JOHNSON INVESTIGATED THE POSITION AS CHAIR OF OBSTETRICS--- AND-GYNECOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, HE INTERVIEWED A VARIETY--- OF DECISION-MAKERS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. THE RESULT--- OF THE CONVERSATIONS AND HIS REFLECTION UPON WHAT POSSIBLE TO BUILD IN--- THE MEDICAL SCHOOL WAS AN 18-PAGE VISION AND PLANNING DOCUMENT. THIS DOCUMENT--- REFLECTED THE VISIONS AND POSSIBILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE MEDICAL--- SCHOOL AND REQUIRED VERY LITTLE NEGOTIATION TO REACH AGREEMENT BECAUSE--- OF THE SHARED INTERESTS AND COMMON GROUND FOR THOSE WITH WHOM HE WOULD--- EVENTUALLY DEVELOP THE VISION.-AND HOW DID HE DISCOVER THE SHARED INTERESTS--- AND THE POTENTIAL FOR BUILDING A GREAT DEPARTMENT? THROUGH INQUIRY, LISTENING---, CLARIFYING, AND DEVELOPING SHARED INTERESTS.----------------  BARGAINING----------  BARGAINING IS THE STAGE THAT MOST PEOPLE ASSOCIATE WITH NEGOTIATION.--- HOWEVER, THIS STAGE ALONE IS NOT NEGOTIATING. IT BEGINS WITH AN EXCHANGE--- OF TERMS, AN OPENING OF THE DISCUSSION OF-A "DEAL". DR. STEVE BLUM TEACHES--- AAMC EDS PARTICIPANTS TO DELAY THIS STAGE AS LONG AS REASONABLE, BUT TO--- RECOGNIZE WHEN IT BEGINS. HE TEACHERS, "AS SOON AS A NUMBER OR TERM IS--- MENTIONED BY ONE PARTY, YOU HAVE BEGUN TO MOVE OUT OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE--- AND INTO BARGAINING." IN NEGOTIATIONS THAT HAVE PROCEEDED WELL THROUGH--- THE STAGE OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE, THIS TRANSITION OCCURS SMOOTHLY AS--- A NATURAL EXTENSION OF HOW TO ENACT THE IDEAS THAT HAVE EMERGED. IF EXCHANGE--- IS DONE EFFECTIVELY, BOTH PARTIES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE DISCOVERED A NUMBER--- OF DIFFERENT RESOLUTIONS-THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN THE IDEAS BROUGHT--- TO THE INITIAL DISCUSSION BY EITHER PARTY.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  BOTH PARTIES ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO BE PLEASED WITH THEIR FINAL TRANSACTION--- IF THEY COME TO THE DISCUSSION WITH THEIR VERY BEST CASE SCENARIO IN MIND.--- THE OLD ADAGE "THINK POSITIVE" IS THE RIGHT ONE FOR NEGOTIATION. KING--- CHING OF CHOU IN THE 12TH CENTURY IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID, "HIGH ACHIEVEMENT--- COMES FROM HIGH AIMS." WHEN NEGOTIATING, THINK ABOUT MEETING MUTUAL NEEDS--- AND DESIRES WITH COMPLEMENTARY SOLUTIONS. OF COURSE, ONE MUST PREPARE--- WELL BY KNOWING THE-BOTTOM LINE, OR BEST-ALTERNATIVE TO A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT.--- (WE WILL-TALK MORE ABOUT BATNA IN A SUBSEQUENT ISSUE.) AND, OF COURSE--- IT IS-IMPORTANT TO KNOW ONE'S VALUES SO AS NOT TO COMPROMISE THEM. HOWEVER---, THE BEST BARGAINING WILL RESULT IN ALL PARTIES FEELING AS THOUGH THEY--- HAVE ACQUIRED VALUE AND LOST LITTLE OR NONE. THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE NEGOTIATORS--- SPEND SUFFICIENT TIME PRIOR TO THE BARGAINING STAGE TO DISCOVER COMMON--- GROUND ON VALUES AND MUTUAL BENEFIT IN EXCHANGING PROPERTIES OR IDEAS.--------------  THE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES IN CURRICULUM THAT ARE BECOMING ESTABLISHED ACROSS--- THE NATION ARE THE RESULTS OF EFFECTIVE NEGOTIATION WITH MANY INDIVIDUALS--- WITH MANY INTERESTS. THE "BARGAIN" IS OFTEN A METHOD OF INCREASING ONE--- DEPARTMENT'S VISIBILITY IN RETURN FOR SUPPORT FOR-MORE DISPERSED OR INTEGRATED--- TEACHING. OFTEN, THIS REQUIRES NEGOTIATION OF A NEW METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING--- FUNDS TO DEPARTMENTS TO RECOGNIZE TEACHING EFFORT AND ALWAYS A CONSIDERATION--- OF HOW THESE NEW DISTRIBUTION METHODS IMPACT UPON DEPARTMENTAL AND DIVISIONAL--- BUDGETING. EACH OF THESE IS A RESULT OF A BARGAINING PROCESS THAT BUILDS--- INTO THE-LARGER VISION OF MORE EFFECTIVE TEACHING, LEARNING, AND ORGANIZATIONAL--- INNOVATION.----------  CLOSING AND COMMITMENT----------  WHEN VARIOUS OPTIONS HAVE BEEN FULLY EXPLORED, WEIGHTED BY EACH PARTY---, AND OFTEN ADJUSTED, CLOSING MAY-OCCUR. BLUM TELLS US THAT WE OBTAIN TRUE--- COMMITMENT FROM THE OTHER PARTY "WHEN THE ALTERNATIVES ARE NOT AS ATTRACTIVE--- AS FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE DEAL. " IN AN EFFECTIVE NEGOTIATION, BOTH--- PARTIES WILL COME TO THIS POINT OF BEST POSSIBLE COMBINATION OF TERMS--- IN A SIMILAR TIME FRAME.----------  ROBERT FROST SAID, "GOOD FENCES MAKE GOOD NEIGHBORS." A STRONG AND VISIBLE--- CLOSING AND DEFINITION OF TERMS FACILITATES AN ONGOING, TRUSTWORTHY RELATIONSHIP.--- ONE MIGHT SAY OF BARGAINING, "A GOOD CONTRACT MAKES A GOOD BARGAIN-AND--- A POTENTIAL LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BENEFIT BOTH--- PARTIES. IN THE UNITES-STATES, A SYMBOLIC HANDSHAKE SIGNIFIES A VERBAL--- AGREEMENT. SIGNING A CONTRACT OR MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING OR PLACING--- FUNDS IN-ESCROW SHOWS GOOD FAITH INTENTION TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE AGREEMENT.--- A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT SUCH AS A PRESS RELEASE OR PRESENTATION AT AN IMPORTANT--- MEETING GIVES CREDENCE TO THE PLAN.----------  SUMMARY-----------------------  "IN THE-LAST ANALYSIS, YOU CANNOT LEARN NEGOTIATING TECHNIQUES FROM--- A BOOK. YOU MUST ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE.-------------" - FREUND, ANATOMY OF A MERGER------------- 1975  THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE YOUR NEGOTIATION-EFFECTIVENESS IS TO BE CONSCIOUS--- OF YOUR OWN OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSCIOUSLY WORK TO IMPROVE YOUR SKILL.--- BLUM CREDITS SHELL IN TEACHING THAT EFFECTIVE NEGOTIATORS SHARE SIMILAR--- CHARACTERISTICS. THEY ALL:-------------------  ENGAGE IN SYSTEMATIC PLANNING AND PREPARATION----------  HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS----------  MAINTAIN A REPUTATION FOR RELIABILITY AND INTEGRITY----------  EXHIBIT STRONG LISTENING SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECT MATTER, VERBAL----- SKILLS AND SELF-CONFIDENCE.-------------------  FORTUNATELY, THESE ARE ALL CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR ACADEMIC--- SUCCESS AS WELL. WHETHER YOUR FOCUS IS CLINICAL CARE, EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION---, OR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, YOU LIKELY HAVE DEVELOPED CONSIDERABLE FOUNDATION--- IN EACH OF THESE SKILLS AND TRAITS. USING THE FOUR STAGES, YOU SHOULD--- BE ABLE TO ENHANCE YOUR NEGOTIATION EFFECTIVENESS. AT THE 2004 AAMC ANNUAL--- MEETING, DRS. JAYNE THORSON, TIM JOHNSON, AND DEE FENNER FROM THE UNIVERSITY--- OF MICHIGAN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE SHARED SOME BASIC TIPS FOR NEGOTIATING--- NEW POSITIONS IN ACADEMICS. ALL RELY ON THE BASIC STAGES OF NEGOTIATION---, STAGES THAT DR. FENNER DESCRIBES AS "A UNIVERSAL DANCE WITH FOUR STEPS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"  TIPS ON NEGOTIATING FOR A NEW POSITION IN ACADEMICS------------------ FROM THE WIM ANNUAL-MEETING SESSION, NEGOTIATING FOR YOUR------ SUCCESS JAYNE THORSON, TIM JOHNSON, DEE FENNER---------------------  KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO MEET YOUR GOALS AND ESTABLISH TARGETS----- OF 6 MONTHS, ONE YEAR, FIVE YEARS. IN DISCUSSING A NEW POSITION-----, BE-SURE TO ADDRESS THE METRICS BY WHICH SUCCESS IS MEASURED IN----- THE NEW ORGANIZATION. ASK QUESTIONS THAT REQUIRE A CONCRETE RESPONSE:-----------------  + IF I WERE TO TAKE THIS POSITION, WHAT ACTIONS OR OUTCOMES------ WOULD MAKE YOU THINK OF ME AS A SUCCESS?------------  + WHO ARE THE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE IN THIS ORGANIZATION? WHY?------ (THEN YOU SHOULD ASK TO MEET WITH THEM.------------)  + AT THE END OF ONE YEAR- TWO YEARS, FIVE YEARS, HOW WILL------ YOU JUDGE MY SUCCESS?-----------------------------------  USE THE RESPONSES TO #1 TO CONSTRUCT A 1, 2, AND 5 YEAR PLAN----- IN WRITING. BE SURE TO STATE YOUR INTERESTS AND NEEDS RATHER THAN----- MAKING DEMANDS. AIM HIGH. WHY? "YOU'LL BE MORE LIKELY TO HIT THE----- TARGET".-------------  FIND OUT HOW DECISIONS ARE MADE IN THE ORGANIZATION. BE SURE----- TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE PERSON WHO MAKES THE REAL DECISIONS.-------------  LISTEN FOR WHAT IS SAID AND WHAT IS NOT SAID.
